<h3>Question (ID-1382648):</h3><h2>Which PEP's are must reads?</h2><p>I'm a fairly strong Python coder, but too much of my style is a little haphazard, and I'm sure there are more Pythonic solutions to many problems than the ones I come up with. Which PEPs are essential for any well versed Pythonista to read?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-5):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Definitely <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow">PEP 8</a>, a Style Guide for Python.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I found that reading the declined ones can give some good insights into what's Pythonic and what isn't.
This was a while ago so I don't have any specific examples.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Although Python is incredibly intuitive, a lot of people do not comprehend his philosophy.</p>

<blockquote>

  <ul>
  <li>Beautiful is better than ugly.</li>
  <li>Explicit is better than implicit.</li>
  <li>Simple is better than complex.</li>
  <li>Complex is better than complicated.</li>
  <li>Flat is better than nested.</li>
  <li>Sparse is better than dense.</li>
  <li>Readability counts.</li>
  <li>Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.</li>
  <li>Although practicality beats purity.</li>
  <li>Errors should never pass silently.</li>
  <li>Unless explicitly silenced.</li>
  <li>In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.</li>
  <li>There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do
  it.</li>
  <li>Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.</li>
  <li>Now is better than never.</li>
  <li>Although never is often better than <em>right</em> now.</li>
  <li>If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.</li>
  <li>If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.</li>
  <li>Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!</li>
  </ul>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Also pep <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/" rel="nofollow">0257</a> docstring convention</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>It is now retrospective, but still interesting: I think <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3099/" rel="nofollow">Things that will Not Change in Python 3000</a> is a good read, with lots of links to the discussions that preceded the decisions.</p>
