<h3>Question (ID-361675):</h3><h2>Python - doctest vs. unittest</h2><p>I'm trying to get started with unit testing in Python and I was wondering if someone could inform me of the advantages and disadvantages of doctest and unittest.  What conditions would you use each for?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Both are valuable.  I use both doctest and a further unit testing framework (<a href="http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/" rel="nofollow">nose</a>) taking the place of unittest. I use doctest for cases where the test is giving an example of usage that is actually useful as documentation.  Generally I don't make these tests comprehensive, aiming solely for informative.  I'm effectively using doctest in reverse:  not to test my code is correct based on my doctest, but to check that my documentation is correct based on the code.</p>

<p>The reason is that I find comprehensive doctests will clutter your documentation far too much, so you will either end up with either unusable docstrings, or incomplete testing.</p>

<p>For actually testing the <em>code</em>, the goal is to thoroughly test every case, rather than illustrate what is does by example, which is a different goal which I think is better met by other frameworks.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I use unittest almost exclusively.</p>

<p>Once in a while, I'll put some stuff in a docstring that's usable by doctest.</p>

<p>95% of the test cases are unittest.</p>

<p>Why?  I like keeping docstrings somewhat shorter and more to the point.  Sometimes test cases help clarify a docstring.  Most of the time, the application's test cases are too long for a docstring.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If you're just getting started with the idea of unit testing, I would start with <code>doctest</code> because it is so simple to use. It also naturally provides some level of documentation. And for more comprehensive testing with <code>doctest</code>, you can place tests in an external file so it doesn't clutter up your documentation.</p>

<p>I would suggest <code>unittest</code> if you're coming from a background of having used JUnit or something similar, where you want to be able to write unit tests in generally the same way as you have been elsewhere.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Using both is a valid and rather simple option. The <code>doctest</code> module provides the <code>DoctTestSuite</code> and <code>DocFileSuite</code> methods which create a unittest-compatible testsuite from a module or file, respectively.</p>

<p>So I use both and typically use doctest for simple tests with functions that require little or no setup (simple types for arguments). I actually think a few doctest tests <em>help</em> document the function, rather than detract from it.</p>

<p>But for more complicated cases, and for a more comprehensive set of test cases, I use unittest which provides more control and flexibility.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I almost never use doctests. I want my code to be self documenting, and the docstrings provide the documentation to the user. IMO adding hundreds of lines of tests to a module makes the docstrings far less readable. I also find unit tests easier to modify when needed. </p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I use unittest exclusively; I think doctest clutters up the main module too much.  This probably has to do with writing thorough tests.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Another advantage of doctesting is that you get to make sure your code does what your documentation says it does.  After a while, software changes can make your documentation and code do different things.  :-)</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>I prefer the discovery based systems ("nose" and "py.test", using the former currently).</p>

<p>doctest is nice when the test is also good as a documentation, otherwise they tend to clutter the code too much.</p>
