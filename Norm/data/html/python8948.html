<h3>Question (ID-8948):</h3><h2>Accessing mp3 Meta-Data with Python</h2><p>What is the best way to retrieve mp3 metadata in python?  I've seen a couple frameworks out there, but I'm unsure as to which would be the best to use.... Any ideas?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-10):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I used <a href="http://eyed3.nicfit.net/" rel="nofollow">eyeD3</a> the other day with a lot of success.  I found that it could add artwork to the ID3 tag which the other modules I looked at couldn't.  You'll have to download the tar and execute <code>python setup.py install</code> from the source folder.  </p>

<p>Relevant examples from the website are below.</p>

<p>Reading the contents of an mp3 file containing either v1 or v2 tag info:</p>

<pre><code> import eyeD3
 tag = eyeD3.Tag()
 tag.link("/some/file.mp3")
 print tag.getArtist()
 print tag.getAlbum()
 print tag.getTitle()
</code></pre>

<p>Read an mp3 file (track length, bitrate, etc.) and access it's tag:</p>

<pre><code>if eyeD3.isMp3File(f):
     audioFile = eyeD3.Mp3AudioFile(f)
     tag = audioFile.getTag()
</code></pre>

<p>Specific tag versions can be selected:</p>

<pre><code> tag.link("/some/file.mp3", eyeD3.ID3_V2)
 tag.link("/some/file.mp3", eyeD3.ID3_V1)
 tag.link("/some/file.mp3", eyeD3.ID3_ANY_VERSION)  # The default.
</code></pre>

<p>Or you can iterate over the raw frames:</p>

<pre><code> tag = eyeD3.Tag()
 tag.link("/some/file.mp3")
 for frame in tag.frames:
    print frame
</code></pre>

<p>Once a tag is linked to a file it can be modified and saved:</p>

<pre><code> tag.setArtist(u"Cro-Mags")
 tag.setAlbum(u"Age of Quarrel")
 tag.update()
</code></pre>

<p>If the tag linked in was v2 and you'd like to save it as v1:</p>

<pre><code> tag.update(eyeD3.ID3_V1_1)
</code></pre>

<p>Read in a tag and remove it from the file:</p>

<pre><code> tag.link("/some/file.mp3")
 tag.remove()
 tag.update()
</code></pre>

<p>Add a new tag:</p>

<pre><code> tag = eyeD3.Tag()
 tag.link('/some/file.mp3')    # no tag in this file, link returned False
 tag.header.setVersion(eyeD3.ID3_V2_3)
 tag.setArtist('Fugazi')
 tag.update()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I've used <a href="http://code.google.com/p/quodlibet/wiki/Mutagen" rel="nofollow">mutagen</a> to edit tags in media files before.  The nice thing about mutagen is that it can handle other formats, such as mp4, FLAC etc.  I've written several scripts with a lot of success using this API.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>What you're after is the <a href="http://id3-py.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow" title="Unison Home Page">ID3</a> module.  It's very simple and will give you exactly what you need.  Just copy the ID3.py file into your site-packages directory and you'll be able to do something like the following:</p>

<pre><code>from ID3 import *
try:
  id3info = ID3('file.mp3')
  print id3info
  # Change the tags
  id3info['TITLE'] = "Green Eggs and Ham"
  id3info['ARTIST'] = "Dr. Seuss"
  for k, v in id3info.items():
    print k, ":", v
except InvalidTagError, message:
  print "Invalid ID3 tag:", message
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>A simple example from the book Dive Into Python works ok for me, <a href="http://www.diveintopython.org/download/diveintopython-examples-5.4.zip" rel="nofollow">this</a> is the download link, the example is fileinfo.py. Don't know if it's the best, but it can do the basic job.</p>

<p>The entire book is available online <a href="http://www.diveintopython.org/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.dotfunk.com/projects/mp3/" rel="nofollow">This toolkit</a> may do what you need. I can't say if it's the "best", but really, if it does what you need, that's all that matters, right?</p>

<p>HTH</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>It can depend on exactly what you want to do in addition to reading the metadata. If it is just simply the bitrate / name etc. that you need, and nothing else, something lightweight is probably best.</p>

<p>If you're manipulating the mp3 past that PyMedia may be suitable.</p>

<p>There are quite a few, whatever you do get, make sure and test it out on plenty of sample media. There are a few different versions of ID3 tags in particular, so make sure it's not too out of date. </p>

<p>Personally I've used this small MP3Info class with luck. It is quite old though.</p>

<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I looked the above answers and found out that they are not good for my project because of licensing problems with GPL.</p>

<p>And I found out this: <a href="http://pyid3lib.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">PyID3Lib</a>, while that particular <em>python binding</em> release date is old, it uses the <a href="http://id3lib.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">ID3Lib</a>, which itself is up to date.</p>

<p>Notable to mention is that both are <strong>LGPL</strong>, and are good to go.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>check this one out:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Ciantic/songdetails" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/Ciantic/songdetails</a></p>

<p>Usage example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import songdetails
&gt;&gt;&gt; song = songdetails.scan("data/song.mp3")
&gt;&gt;&gt; print song.duration
0:03:12
</code></pre>

<p>Saving changes:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import songdetails
&gt;&gt;&gt; song = songdetails.scan("data/commit.mp3")
&gt;&gt;&gt; song.artist = "Great artist"
&gt;&gt;&gt; song.save()
</code></pre>
