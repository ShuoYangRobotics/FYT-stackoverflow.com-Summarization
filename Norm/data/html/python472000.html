<blockquote>
  <p>The proper use of <code>__slots__</code> is to save space in objects. Instead of having
  a dynamic dict that allows adding attributes to objects at anytime,
  there is a static structure which does not allow additions after creation.
  This saves the overhead of one dict for every object that uses slots. While this is sometimes a useful optimization, it would be completely
  unnecessary if the Python interpreter was dynamic enough so that it would
  only require the dict when there actually were additions to the object.</p>
  
  <p>Unfortunately there is a side effect to slots. They change the behavior of
  the objects that have slots in a way that can be abused by control freaks
  and static typing weenies. This is bad, because the control freaks should
  be abusing the metaclasses and the static typing weenies should be abusing
  decorators, since in Python, there should be only one obvious way of doing something.</p>
  
  <p>Making CPython smart enough to handle saving space without <code>__slots__</code> is a major
  undertaking, which is probably why it is not on the list of changes for P3k (yet).</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You would want to use <code>__slots__</code> if you are going to instantiate a lot (hundreds, thousands) of objects of the same class. <code>__slots__</code> only exists as a memory optimization tool.</p>

<p>It's highly discouraged to use <code>__slots__</code> for constraining attribute creation, and in general you want to avoid it because it breaks pickle, along with some other introspection features of python.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Each python object has a <code>__dict__</code> atttribute which is a dictionary containing all other attributes. e.g. when you type <code>self.attr</code> python is actually doing <code>self.__dict__['attr']</code>. As you can imagine using a dictionary to store attribute takes some extra space &amp; time for accessing it.</p>

<p>However, when you use <code>__slots__</code>, any object created for that class won't have a <code>__dict__</code> attribute. Instead, all attribute access is done directly via pointers.</p>

<p>So if want a C style structure rather than a full fledged class you can use <code>__slots__</code> for compacting size of the objects &amp; reducing attribute access time. A good example is a Point class containing attributes x &amp; y. If you are going to have a lot of points, you can try using <code>__slots__</code> in order to conserve some memory.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You have -- essentially -- no use for <code>__slots__</code>.  </p>

<p>The time when you think you might need <code>__slots__</code>, you actually want to use <strong>Lightweght</strong> or <strong>Flyweight</strong> design patterns.  These are cases when you no longer want to use purely Python objects.  Instead, you want a Python object-like wrapper around an array, struct or numpy array.</p>

<pre><code>class Flyweight( object ):
    def get( self, theData, index ):
        return theData[index]
    def set( self, theData, index, value ):
        theData[index]= value
</code></pre>

<p>The class-like wrapper has no attributes -- it just provides methods that act on the underlying data.  The methods can be reduced to class methods.  Indeed, it could be reduced to just functions operating on the underlying array of data.</p>
