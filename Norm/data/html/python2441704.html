<h3>Question (ID-2441704):</h3><h2>How do you use pip, virtual_env and Fabric to handle deployement?</h2><p>What are your settings, your tricks, and above all, your work flow?</p>

<p>These tools are great but they are still no best practices attached to their usage, so I don't know what is the most efficient way to use them.</p>

<ul>
<li>Do you use <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip" rel="nofollow">pip</a> bundles or always
download? </li>
<li>Do you set up Apache/Cherokee/MySQL by hand or do
you have a script for than. </li>
<li>Do you put everything in <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv" rel="nofollow">virtual_env</a> and use --no-site-package?</li>
<li>Do you use one virtual_env for several projects?</li>
<li>What do
you use <a href="http://docs.fabfile.org/0.9.0/" rel="nofollow">Fabric</a> for (which part of
your deployment do you script)? </li>
<li>Do you put your Fabric scripts in on the client or the server?</li>
<li>How do you handle database and media file migration?</li>
<li>Do you even need a build tool such as
<a href="http://www.scons.org/" rel="nofollow">SCons</a>?</li>
<li>What are the steps of your deployment? How often do you perform each of them?</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>

I work on mostly small sites, so no multiple-server deployments, CDNs etc. I do need to support Webfaction shared hosting deployment, as some clients need the cheapest hosting they can find. I do often have to deploy sites multiple times in different environments, so repeatable scripted deploys are critical.</p>

<ul>
<li>I don't use pip bundles, I install from a requirements.txt. I do run my own <a href="http://github.com/ask/chishop" rel="nofollow">chishop</a> server with sdists of everything I need, so there aren't multiple single points of failure in the build process. I also use PIP_DOWNLOAD_CACHE on my development machines to speed up bootstrapping project environments, since most of my projects' requirements overlap quite a bit.</li>
<li>I have <a href="http://fabfile.org" rel="nofollow">Fabric</a> scripts that can automatically set up and configure nginx + Apache/mod_wsgi on an Ubuntu VPS, or configure the equivalent on <a href="http://webfaction.com" rel="nofollow">Webfaction</a> shared hosting, and then deploy the project.</li>
<li>I do not use --no-site-packages with virtualenv, because I prefer having slow-moving compiled packages (Python Imaging Library, psycopg2) installed at the system level; too slow and troublesome to do inside every virtualenv. I have not had trouble with polluted system site-packages, because I generally don't pollute it. And in any case, you can install a different version of something in the virtualenv and it will take precedence.</li>
<li>Each project has its own virtualenv. I have some bash scripts (not <a href="http://www.doughellmann.com/projects/virtualenvwrapper/" rel="nofollow">virtualenvwrapper</a>, though a lot of people use that and love it) that automate deploying the virtualenv for a given project to a known location and installing that project's requirements into it.</li>
<li>The entire deployment process, from a bare Ubuntu server VPS or Webfaction shared hosting account to a running website, is scripted using Fabric.</li>
<li>Fabric scripts are part of the project source tree, and I run them from a local development checkout.</li>
<li>I have no need for SCons (that I am aware of).</li>
<li>At the moment a fresh deployment is split into these steps: "fab staging bootstrap" (server setup and initial code deploy), "fab staging enable" (enable the Apache/nginx config for this site), and "fab staging reload_server" (reload Apache/nginx config). Those can of course be combined into a single command line "fab staging bootstrap enable reload_server". Once these steps are done, updating the deployment with new code is just "fab staging deploy". If I need to roll back an update, "fab staging rollback." Edit: nothing particularly magical in the rollback; it just rolls back the code to the last-deployed version and migrates the database to the previous state (this does require recording some metadata about the migration state of the DB post-deploy, I just do that in a text file).</li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I use fabric to build and deploy my code and assume a system already set up for that. I think that a tool like <a href="http://www.puppetlabs.com/" rel="nofollow">puppet</a> is more appropriate to automate the installation of things like apache and mysql, though I have yet to really include it in my workflow.</p>

<p>Also, I usually have a different virtualenv per project. They are created from a 'base' install of python where - as Carl pointed out - you can leave some global python libraries.</p>

<p>So in terms of workflow that would be:</p>

<ol>
<li>puppet to install required services (web server, database, ssh server, ...)</li>
<li>puppet to set up required users and base folders</li>
<li>fabric to create virtualenv for the application (<em>not</em> using --no-site-package)</li>
<li>fabric to pip install from requirements.txt</li>
<li>fabric to deploy your app</li>
<li>fabric to deploy configuration files (web server, ...)</li>
</ol>
