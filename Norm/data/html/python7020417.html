<h3>Question (ID-7020417):</h3><h2>What is 'print' in Python?</h2><p>I understand what print does, but of what "type" is the operator? I think it's a function, but why does this fail?</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;print print
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
</code></pre>

<p>Isn't <code>print</code> a function? Shouldn't it print something like this?</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;print print
&lt;function print at ...&gt;
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-4):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>In 2.7 and down, <code>print</code> is a statement. In python 3, <code>print</code> is a function. To use the print function in Python 2.6 or 2.7, you can do </p>

<pre><code>[~/repo/py]
|4&gt;from __future__ import print_function

[~/repo/py]
|5&gt;print print
--&gt;print(print)
&lt;built-in function print&gt;

The ``print`` statement
***********************

   print_stmt ::= "print" ([expression ("," expression)* [","]]
                  | "&gt;&gt;" expression [("," expression)+ [","]])

``print`` evaluates each expression in turn and writes the resulting
object to standard output (see below).  If an object is not a string,
it is first converted to a string using the rules for string
conversions.  The (resulting or original) string is then written.  A
space is written before each object is (converted and) written, unless
the output system believes it is positioned at the beginning of a
line.  This is the case (1) when no characters have yet been written
to standard output, (2) when the last character written to standard
output is a whitespace character except ``' '``, or (3) when the last
write operation on standard output was not a ``print`` statement. (In
some cases it may be functional to write an empty string to standard
output for this reason.)

Help on built-in function print in module builtins:

print(...)
    print(value, ..., sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout)

    Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default.
    Optional keyword arguments:
    file: a file-like object (stream); defaults to the current sys.stdout.
    sep:  string inserted between values, default a space.
    end:  string appended after the last value, default a newline.

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><code>print</code> is a mistake that has been rectified in Python 3. In Python 3 it is a function. In Python 1.x and 2.x it is not a function, it is a special form like <code>if</code> or <code>while</code>, but unlike those two it is not a control structure.</p>

<p>So, I guess the most accurate thing to call it is a statement.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>In Python all statements (except assignment) are expressed with reserved words, not addressible objects.  That is why you cannot simply <code>print print</code> and you get a <code>SyntaxError</code> for trying.  It's a reserved word, not an object.</p>

<p>Confusingly, you <strong>can</strong> have a variable named <code>print</code>.  You can't address it in the normal way, but you can <code>setattr(locals(), 'print', somevalue)</code> and then <code>print locals()['print']</code>.</p>

<p>Other reserved words that might be desirable as variable names but are nonetheless verboten:</p>

<pre><code>class
import
return
raise
except
try
pass
lambda
</code></pre>
