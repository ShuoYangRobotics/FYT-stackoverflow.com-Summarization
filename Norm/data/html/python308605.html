<h3>Question (ID-308605):</h3><h2>Adding REST to Django -- Poll</h2><p>I've got a Django application that works nicely.  I'm adding REST services.  I'm looking for some additional input on my REST strategy.  </p>

<p>Here are some examples of things I'm wringing my hands over.</p>

<ul>
<li>Right now, I'm using the Django-REST API with a pile of patches.  </li>
<li>I'm thinking of falling back to simply writing view functions in Django that return JSON results.</li>
<li>I can also see filtering the REST requests in Apache and routing them to a separate, non-Django server instance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please nominate one approach per answer so we can vote them up or down.</p>

<ul>
<li>Explicit</li>
<li>Portable to other frameworks</li>
<li>Doesn't require patching Django</li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>For anyone else looking for a very decent, pluggable API application for Django, make sure you checkout jespern's <a href="http://bitbucket.org/jespern/django-piston" rel="nofollow">django-piston</a> which is used internally at BitBucket.</p>

<p>It's well maintained, has a great following and some cool forks which do things like add support for pagination and other authentication methods (OAuth is supported out of the box).</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Please note that REST does not just mean JSON results. REST essentially means exposing a resource-oriented API over native but full-fledged HTTP. I am not an expert on REST, but here are a few of the things Rails is doing.</p>

<ul>
<li>URLs should be good, simple names for resources</li>
<li>Use the right HTTP methods
<ul>
<li>HEAD, GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE</li>
<li>Optionally with an override (form parameter '_method' will override HTTP request-method)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Support content-type negotiation via Accept request-header
<ul>
<li>Optionally with an override (filename extension in the URL will override MIME-type in the Accept request-header)</li>
<li>Available content types should include XML, XHTML, HTML, JSON, YAML, and many others as appropriate</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>For example, to get the native HTTP support going, the server should respond to</p>

<pre><code>GET /account/profile HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept: application/json
</code></pre>

<p>as it would respond to</p>

<pre><code>GET /account/profile.json HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
</code></pre>

<p>And it should respond to</p>

<pre><code>PUT /account/profile HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com

var=value
</code></pre>

<p>as it would respond to</p>

<pre><code>POST /account/profile HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com

_method=PUT&amp;var=value
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Scrap the Django REST api and come up with your own open source project that others can contribute to.  I would be willing to contribute.  I have some code that is based on the forms api to do REST.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><blockquote>

<p>I would go with that .. <br>
Ali A summed it pretty well.</p>

<p>The main point for me is beign explicit. I would avoid using a function that automatically converts an object into json, what if the object has a reference to a user and somehow the password (even if it's hashed) go into the json snippit? </p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You could take look at <a href="http://github.com/funkbit/django-dynamicresponse" rel="nofollow">django-dynamicresponse</a>, which is a lightweight framework for adding REST API with JSON to your Django applications.</p>

<p>It requires minimal changes to add API support to existing Django apps, and makes it straight-forward to build-in API from the start in new projects.</p>

<p>Basically, it includes middleware support for parsing JSON into request.POST, in addition to serializing the returned context to JSON or rendering a template/redirecting conditionally based on the request type.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>My answer to the same question here: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2488325/framework-for-implementing-rest-web-service-in-django/6535255#6535255">Framework for Implementing REST web service in Django</a></p>

<p>The short version is, have a look at <a href="https://github.com/jgorset/respite/" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/jgorset/respite/</a> a REST framework in its early days, but we use it every day on client projects.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>I ended up going with my own REST API framework for Django (that I'd love to get rid of if I can find a workable alternative), with a few custom views thrown in for corner cases I didn't want to deal with. It's worked out ok. </p>

<p>So a combination of 1 and 2; without some form of framework you'll end up writing the same boilerplate for the common cases.</p>

<p>I've also done a few stand-alone APIs. I like having them as stand-alone services, but the very fact that they stand alone from the rest of the code leads to them getting neglected. No technical reason; simply out-of-sight, out-of-mind.</p>

<p>What I'd really like to see is an approach that unifies Django forms and REST APIs, as they often share a lot of logic. Conceptually if your app exposes something in HTML it likely wants to expose it programmatically as well. </p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>you could try making a generic functions that process the data (like parand mentioned) which you can call from the views that generate the web pages, as well as those that generate the json/xml/whatever</p>
