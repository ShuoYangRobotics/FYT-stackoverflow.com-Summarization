<h3>Question (ID-402359):</h3><h2>How do you uninstall a python package that was installed using distutils?</h2><p>Can you simply delete the directory from your python installation, or are there any lingering files that you must delete?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>It varies based on the options that you pass to <code>install</code> and the contents of the <a href="http://docs.python.org/install/index.html#inst-config-files" rel="nofollow">distutils configuration files</a> on the system/in the package. I don't believe that any files are modified outside of directories specified in these ways.</p>

<p>Notably, <a href="http://bugs.python.org/issue4673" rel="nofollow">distutils does not have an uninstall command</a> at this time. </p>

<p>It's also noteworthy that deleting a package/egg can cause dependency issues -- utilities like <a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall" rel="nofollow"><code>easy_install</code></a> attempt to alleviate such problems.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Yes, it is safe to simply delete anything that distutils installed. That goes for installed folders or .egg files. Naturally anything that depends on that code will no longer work. </p>

<p>If you want to make it work again, simply re-install. </p>

<p>By the way, if you are using distutils also consider using the multi-version feature. It allows you to have multiple versions of any single package installed. That means you do not need to delete an old version of a package if you simply want to install a newer version.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If this is for testing and/or development purposes, <a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools" rel="nofollow">setuptools</a> has a <a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools#develop-deploy-the-project-source-in-development-mode" rel="nofollow">develop</a> command that updates every time you make a change (so you don't have to uninstall and reinstall every time you make a change).  And you can uninstall the package using this command as well.</p>

<p>If you do use this, anything that you declare as a <em>script</em> will be left behind as a lingering file.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The three things that get installed that you will need to delete are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Packages/modules</li>
<li>Scripts</li>
<li>Data files</li>
</ol>

<p>Now on my linux system these live in:</p>

<ol>
<li>/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages</li>
<li>/usr/bin</li>
<li>/usr/share</li>
</ol>

<p>But on a windows system they are more likely to be entirely within the Python distribution directory. I have no idea about OSX except it is more likey to follow the linux pattern.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I just uninstalled a python package, and even though I'm not <em>certain</em> I did so perfectly, I'm reasonably confident.  </p>

<p>I started by getting a list of <em>all</em> python-related files, ordered by date, on the assumption that all of the files in my package will have more or less the same timestamp, and no other files will.</p>

<p>Luckily, I've got python installed under <code>/opt/Python-2.6.1</code>; if I had been using the Python that comes with my Linux distro, I'd have had to scour all of <code>/usr</code>, which would have taken a long time.</p>

<p>Then I just examined that list, and noted with relief that all the stuff that I wanted to nuke consisted of one directory, <code>/opt/Python-2.6.1/lib/python2.6/site-packages/module-name/</code>, and one file, <code>/opt/Python-2.6.1/lib/python2.6/site-packages/module-x.x.x_blah-py2.6.egg-info</code>.</p>

<p>So I just deleted those.</p>

<p>Here's how I got the date-sorted list of files:</p>

<p><code>find "$@" -printf '%T@ ' -ls | sort -n | cut -d\  -f 2-</code></p>

<p>(I think that's got to be GNU "find", by the way; the flavor you get on OS X doesn't know about "-printf '%T@'")</p>

<p>I use that <em>all</em> the time.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>For Windows 7,</p>

<p><strong>Control Panel --> Programs --> Uninstall</strong></p>

<p>, then </p>

<p>choose the python package to remove.</p>
