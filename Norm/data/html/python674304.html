<h3>Question (ID-674304):</h3><h2>Python's use of __new__ and __init__?</h2><p>I'm just trying to streamline one of my classes and have introduced some functionality in the same style as the flyweight design pattern.</p>

<p>However, I'm a bit confused as to why <code>__init__</code> is always called after <code>__new__</code>. I wasn't expecting this. Can anyone tell me why this is happening and how I implement this functionality otherwise? (apart from putting the implementation into the <code>__new__</code> which feels quite hacky).</p>

<p>Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>class A(object):
    _dict = dict()

    def __new__(cls):
    	if 'key' in A._dict:
    		print "EXISTS"
    		return A._dict['key']
    	else:
    		print "NEW"
    		return super(A, cls).__new__(cls)

    def __init__(self):
    	print "INIT"
    	A._dict['key'] = self
    	print ""

a1 = A()
a2 = A()
a3 = A()
</code></pre>

<p>Outputs:</p>

<pre><code>NEW
INIT

EXISTS
INIT

EXISTS
INIT
</code></pre>

<p>Why?</p>

  <p>Use <strong>__new__</strong> when you need to control
  the creation of a new instance. Use
  <strong>__init__</strong> when you need to control initialization of a new instance.</p>
  
  <p><strong>__new__</strong> is the first step of instance creation.  It's called first, and is
  responsible for returning a new
  instance of your class.  In contrast,
  <strong>__init__</strong> doesn't return anything; it's only responsible for initializing the
  instance after it's been created.</p>
  
  <p>In general, you shouldn't need to
  override <strong>__new__</strong> unless you're
  subclassing an immutable type like
  str, int, unicode or tuple.</p>

<p>You should consider that what you are trying to do is usually done with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory%5Fobject" rel="nofollow">Factory</a> and that's the best way to do it. Using <strong>__new__</strong> is not a good clean solution so please consider the usage of a factory. Here you have <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/86900/" rel="nofollow">a good factory example</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><strong><code>__new__</code></strong> is static class method, while <strong><code>__init__</code></strong> is instance method. 
<strong><code>__new__</code></strong> has to create the instance first, so <strong><code>__init__</code></strong> can initialize it. Note that <strong><code>__init__</code></strong> takes <strong><code>self</code></strong> as parameter. Until you create instance there is no <strong><code>self</code></strong>.</p>

<p>Now, I gather, that you're trying to implement <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern" rel="nofollow">singleton pattern</a> in Python. There are a few ways to do that.</p>

<p>Also, as of Python 2.6, you can use class <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0318/" rel="nofollow">decorators</a>. </p>

<pre><code>def singleton(cls):
    instances = {}
    def getinstance():
        if cls not in instances:
            instances[cls] = cls()
        return instances[cls]
    return getinstance

@singleton
class MyClass:
  ...
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>To quote the <a href="http://www.wingide.com/psupport/python-manual/2.4/ref/customization.html" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>:</p>

<p>"Typical implementations create a new instance of the class by invoking the superclass's __new__() method using "super(currentclass, cls).__new__(cls[, ...])"with appropriate arguments and then modifying the newly-created instance as necessary before returning it."</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>"If __new__() does not return an instance of cls, then the new instance's __init__() method will not be invoked.</p>

<p>__new__() is intended mainly to allow subclasses of immutable types (like int, str, or tuple) to customize instance creation."</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>__new__ should return a new, blank instance of a class. __init__ is then called to initialise that instance. You're not calling __init__ in the "NEW" case of __new__, so it's being called for you. The code that is calling <code>__new__</code> doesn't keep track of whether __init__ has been called on a particular instance or not nor should it, because you're doing something very unusual here.</p>

<p>You could add an attribute to the object in the __init__ function to indicate that it's been initialised. Check for the existence of that attribute as the first thing in __init__ and don't proceed any further if it has been.</p>

<p>Not much of a reason other than that it just is done that way. <code>__new__</code> doesn't have the responsibility of initializing the class, some other method does (<code>__call__</code>, possibly-- I don't know for sure).</p>

<p>You could have <code>__init__</code> do nothing if it's already been initialized, or you could write a new metaclass with a new <code>__call__</code> that only calls <code>__init__</code> on new instances, and otherwise just returns <code>__new__(...)</code>.</p>
