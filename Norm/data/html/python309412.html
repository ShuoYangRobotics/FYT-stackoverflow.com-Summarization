<h3>Question (ID-309412):</h3><h2>How to setup setuptools for python 2.6 on Windows?</h2><p>Is there any way to install setuptools for python 2.6 in Windows without having an .exe installer? </p>

<p>There isn't one built at the moment, and the maintainer of setuptools has stated that it's probable be a while before he'll get to it. </p>

<p>Does anyone know of a way to install it anyway?</p>

<ol>
<li>Download <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools#files" rel="nofollow">setuptools-0.6c9.tar.gz</a></li>
<li>Use <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/" rel="nofollow">7-zip</a> to extract it to a folder(directory) outside your Windows Python installation folder</li>
<li>Go the folder (refer step 3) and run ez_setup.py from the corresponding dos (command) prompt</li>
<li>Ensure that your PATH includes the appropriate C:\Python2X\Scripts directory</li>
</ol>

<p>Second Option:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools#files" rel="nofollow">setuptools-0.6c9.tar.gz</a></li>
<li>Download <a href="http://pypi.python.org/packages/2.6/s/setuptools/setuptools-0.6c9-py2.6.egg#md5=ca37b1ff16fa2ede6e19383e7b59245a" rel="nofollow">setuptools-0.6c9-py2.6.egg</a> to a folder(directory) outside your Windows Python installation folder</li>
<li>Use <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/" rel="nofollow">7-zip</a> to extract ez_setup.py in the same folder as <a href="http://pypi.python.org/packages/2.6/s/setuptools/setuptools-0.6c9-py2.6.egg#md5=ca37b1ff16fa2ede6e19383e7b59245a" rel="nofollow">setuptools-0.6c9-py2.6.egg</a></li>

<p>Please provide feedback.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You could download and run <a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py" rel="nofollow">http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py</a>. This will download and install setuptools.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>The Nov. 21 answer didn't work for me.  I got it working on my 64 bit Vista machine by following the Method 1 instructions, except for Step 3 I typed:</p>

<p>setup.py install</p>

<p>So, in summary, I did:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download setuptools-0.6c9.tar.gz</li>
<li>Use 7-zip to extract it to a folder (directory) outside your Windows Python installation folder</li>
<li>At a DOS (command) prompt, cd to your the newly created setuptools-0.6c9 folder and type "setup.py install" (without the quotes).</li>
<li>Ensure that your PATH includes the appropriate C:\Python2X\Scripts directory</li>
</ol>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I got it working quickly by downloading the source and then running (from the extracted directory):</p>

<pre><code>python.exe setup.py bdist_wininst
</code></pre>

<p>That builds <code>dist\setuptools-0.6c9.win32.exe</code>, which is exactly the installer you're looking for.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I'm able to find the EXE doing google,</p>

<p>you can simply download it from following URL, and double click and install....</p>

<p><a href="http://pypi.python.org/packages/2.6/s/setuptools/setuptools-0.6c11.win32-py2.6.exe#md5=1509752c3c2e64b5d0f9589aafe053dc" rel="nofollow">http://pypi.python.org/packages/2.6/s/setuptools/setuptools-0.6c11.win32-py2.6.exe#md5=1509752c3c2e64b5d0f9589aafe053dc</a></p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>The "first option" (4 steps: download, extract, run, verify PATH) didn't work on my Windows Server 2008 x64 machine with Python 2.6 32 bit installed, nor did it work on my Vista x64 machine with Python 2.6 32 bit installed.</p>

<p>The "second option (5 steps: download, extract, extract, run, verify PATH) worked on both Windows Server 2008 x64 and on Windows Vista x64.</p>

<p>Thanks a bunch for providing the instructions!</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Just installed setuptools as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Downloaded <a href="http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/s/setuptools/setuptools-0.6c9.tar.gz#md5=3864c01d9c719c8924c455714492295e" rel="nofollow">http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/s/setuptools/setuptools-0.6c9.tar.gz#md5=3864c01d9c719c8924c455714492295e</a> , and extracted to a folder outside of my Python installation.</li>
<li>command prompt, then cd into that folder.</li>
<li>enter <em>python setup.py install</em></li>
</ol>

<p>That will install from the source into your python's site-packages folder and any other steps needed. This was on Windows XP SP2.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>OP option 1 did not work for me.</p>

<p>However doing setup.py install as mentioned by NathanD did do the trick.</p>

<p>Maybe that should become option 1?</p>

<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>My advice is to wait until Python 2.6.2 to use Python 2.6 on Windows.  There are still some bugs that make it less than ideal (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=2609380&amp;group%5Fid=78018&amp;atid=551954" rel="nofollow">this one is particularly nasty</a>).  Personally, I wasn't able to get setuptools working totally well on Vista x64 even after installing from source.  Under Python 2.5.4, I haven't had any problems though.</p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>Second option worked for me.</p>

<p>Two notes:</p>

<p>a. After installing, when you using easy_install in vista, do so as administrator. (Right click on your command line shortcut and click "run as administrator"). I had trouble trying to run easy_install without doing that.</p>

<p>b. He means use ez_setup from setuptools-0.6c9.tar.gz</p>
<br /><b>#10</b><br /><p><a href="http://activestate.com/activepython" rel="nofollow">ActivePython</a> already includes setuptools (<a href="http://python-distribute.org/" rel="nofollow">Distribute</a> actually), along with pip and virtualenv. </p>
<br /><b>#11</b><br /><p>setuptools has been updated: <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools/0.6c11" rel="nofollow">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools/0.6c11</a></p>
<br /><b>#12</b><br /><p>The easiest setuptools installation option is to use the pre-packaged Windows Installer.</p>

<p>for <strong>32-bit</strong> Python on Windows, the official setuptools page has been updated and has windows installers for Python 2.6 and 2.7:</p>

<p>for <strong>64-bit</strong> Python on Windows, setuptools Windows installers are available here:</p>
