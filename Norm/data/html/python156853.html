<h3>Question (ID-156853):</h3><h2>What is the best SNMP implementation for Python?</h2><p>I'm doing some GUI prototyping with Python for an SNMP application. Looking around there seem to be a number of python libraries I could use. As I'm prototyping I value a nice clean easy API over speed and preferably a commonly packaged library. Obviously the package should be open source. So far I've been looking PySNMP, Twisted-Snmp, pynetsnmp and seafelt's libsnmp.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-4):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Of the libraries you mention I'd single out the python net-snmp library and pysnmp.  One of my criteria for choosing well supported libraries is are they in debian/ubuntu and these both pass that test.</p>

<p><a href="http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">Net-snmp</a> does come with <a href="https://net-snmp.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/net-snmp/trunk/net-snmp/python/README" rel="nofollow">python bindings</a>. Net-snmp is in some ways the de-facto snmp library (for linux at least) so it is probably a good choice in that respect.  However net-snmp is an extrememly large and gangly C library (which I've spent rather a lot of time hacking on and reading the source code) which is a downside.</p>

<p>The other alternative is a <a href="http://pysnmp.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">pure python snmp library - pysnmp</a> which seems like a sensible choice, though I haven't actually tried that one.  The twisted wrapper for it could come in handy.</p>

<p>If I was starting a new SNMP development I'd try pysnmp to see how well it works, but the old faithful (py)net-snmp is always there if you need it.</p>

<p>If you just want a bit of light usage of snmp then you can use the net-snmp command line tools very easily, eg</p>

<pre><code>snmpget -c password host -v1 enterprises.318.1.1.12.2.3.1.1.2.1
</code></pre>

<p>To read the power usage of an APC powerbar, which would work fine for prototyping I would have thought.</p>

<p><strong>[edit: one year later]</strong></p>

<p>I've now had a chance to try the pysnmp library.</p>

<p>I wasn't happy with the stable branch 2.x, but the development 4.x works and has a lots of good features, including</p>

<ul>
<li>MIB loading</li>
<li>Reasonably simple <a href="http://pysnmp.sourceforge.net/examples/4.x/v3arch/oneliner/manager/getgen.html" rel="nofollow">oneliner interface</a></li>
<li>Full support of set/get/walk with bulk versions of those</li>
<li>Sync and Async interface</li>
<li>Support for server (agent) and client (manager)</li>
</ul>

<p>I found it moderately complicated to work with, but I managed to work it out with help from the docs and the source code.</p>

<p>Top tip: <code>set os.environ['PYSNMP_MIB_DIR']</code> to point to directories with your own converted mibs in, and use <code>build-pysnmp-mib</code> to make them, or if that doesn't work</p>

<pre><code>smidump -k -f python My-MIB.txt | libsmi2pysnmp &gt; My-MIB.py
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.net-snmp.org/" rel="nofollow">Net-Snmp</a> has python bindings. Very simple (command-line like functions) access to SNMP functionality. If you use the Net-Snmp trap daemon, you can direct trap info to python (or any other language) scripts.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>The most active project of "Security not my Problem" seems to be <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycopia-SNMP" rel="nofollow">pycopia SNMP</a>.  I have no experience with any of them, but if you have troubles finding the correct one have a look at the mailinglist archives of the libraries to find the most active one.  Those usually have the better API/implementation or at least more users.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I say the one I wrote last weekend:</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/multicore-snmp/" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/multicore-snmp/</a></p>

<p>Full process based API to Net-SNMP which supports V1-V3.</p>
