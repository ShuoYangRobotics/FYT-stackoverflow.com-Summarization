<h3>Question (ID-53428):</h3><h2>What are some good Python ORM solutions?</h2><p>I'm evaluating and looking at using CherryPy for a project that's basically a javascript front-end from the client-side (browser) that talks to a Python web service on the back-end. So, I really need something fast and lightweight on the back-end that I can implement using Python that then speaks to the PostgreSQL db via an ORM (JSON to the browser).</p>

<p>I'm also looking at Django, which I like, since its ORM is built-in. However, I think Django might be a little more than I really need (i.e. more features than I really need == slower?).</p>

<p>Anyone have any experience with different Python ORM solutions that can compare and contrast their features and functionality, speed, efficiency, etc.?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-12):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>SQLAlchemy is more full-featured and powerful (uses the DataMapper pattern).  Django ORM has a cleaner syntax and is easier to write for (ActiveRecord pattern).  I don't know about performance differences.</p>

<p>SQLAlchemy also has a <a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/docs/orm/extensions/declarative.html" rel="nofollow">declarative layer</a> that hides some complexity and gives it a ActiveRecord-style syntax more similar to the Django ORM.</p>

<p>I wouldn't worry about Django being "too heavy."  It's decoupled enough that you can use the ORM if you want without having to import the rest.</p>

<p>That said, if I were already using CherryPy for the web layer and just needed an ORM, I'd probably opt for SQLAlchemy.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I usually use <a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/" rel="nofollow">SQLAlchemy</a>.  It's pretty powerful and is probably the most mature python ORM.</p>

<p>If you're planning on using CherryPy, you might also look into <a href="http://www.aminus.net/dejavu" rel="nofollow">dejavu</a> as it's by Robert Brewer (the guy that is the current CherryPy project leader).  I personally haven't used it, but I do know some people that love it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sqlobject.org" rel="nofollow">SQLObject</a> is a little bit easier to use ORM than SQLAlchemy, but it's not quite as powerful.</p>

<p>Personally, I wouldn't use the Django ORM unless I was planning on writing the entire project in Django, but that's just me.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><a href="https://storm.canonical.com/" rel="nofollow">Storm</a> has arguably the simplest API:</p>

<pre><code>  class Foo:
      __storm_table__ 'foos'
      id = Int(primary=True)


  class Thing:
      __storm_table__ 'things'
      id = Int(primary=True)
      name = Unicode()
      description = Unicode()
      foo_id = Int()
      foo = Reference(foo_id, Foo.id)

  db = create_database('sqlite:')
  store = Store(db)

  foo = Foo()
  store.add(foo)
  thing = Thing()
  thing.foo = foo
  store.add(thing)
  store.commit()
</code></pre>

<p>And it makes it painless to drop down into raw SQL when you need to:</p>

<pre><code>store.execute('UPDATE bars SET bar_name=? WHERE bar_id like ?', []) 
store.commit()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>SQLAlchemy's <a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/docs/05/reference/ext/declarative.html?highlight=declarative#module-sqlalchemy.ext.declarative" rel="nofollow">declarative</a> extension, which is becoming standard in 0.5, provides an all in one interface very much like that of Django or Storm.  It also integrates seamlessly with classes/tables configured using the datamapper style:</p>

<pre><code>Base = declarative_base()

class Foo(Base):
      __tablename__ 'foos'
      id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)

class Thing(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'things'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(Unicode)
    description = Column(Unicode)
    foo_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('foos.id'))
    foo = relation(Foo)

engine = create_engine('sqlite://')

Base.metadata.create_all(engine)  # issues DDL to create tables

session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)()

foo = Foo()
session.add(foo)
thing = Thing(name='thing1', description='some thing')
thing.foo = foo  # also adds Thing to session
session.commit()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>We use <a href="http://elixir.ematia.de/trac/wiki" rel="nofollow">Elixir</a> alongside SQLAlchemy and have liked it so far. Elixir puts a layer on top of SQLAlchemy that makes it look more like the "ActiveRecord pattern" counter parts.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I think you might look at:</p>

<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>SQLAlchemy is very, very powerful. However it is not thread safe make sure you keep that in mind when working with cherrypy in thread-pool mode. </p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>There is no conceivable way that the unused features in Django will give a performance penalty. Might just come in handy if you ever decide to upscale the project.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>I used Storm + SQLite for a small project, and was pretty happy with it until I added multiprocessing. Trying to use the database from multiple processes resulted in a "Database is locked" exception. I switched to SQLAlchemy, and the same code worked with no problems.</p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>This seems to be the canonical reference point for high-level database interaction in Python:
<a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/HigherLevelDatabaseProgramming" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.python.org/moin/HigherLevelDatabaseProgramming</a></p>

<p>From there, it looks like <a href="http://www.aminus.net/dejavu" rel="nofollow">Dejavu</a> implements Martin Fowler's DataMapper pattern fairly abstractly in Python.</p>
<br /><b>#10</b><br /><p>If you're looking for lightweight and are already familiar with django-style declarative models, check out peewee:
<a href="http://charlesleifer.com/docs/peewee/" rel="nofollow">http://charlesleifer.com/docs/peewee/</a></p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>class Blog(Model):
    name = CharField()

class Entry(Model):
    blog = ForeignKeyField(Blog)
    title = CharField()
    body = TextField()
    pub_date = DateTimeField(default=datetime.datetime.now)

# query it like django
Entry.filter(blog__name='Some great blog')

# or programmatically for finer-grained control
Entry.select().join(Blog).where(name='Some awesome blog')

<br /><b>#11</b><br /><p>I'd check out <a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/" rel="nofollow">SQLAlchemy</a> </p>

<p>It's really easy to use and the models you wrok with aren't bad at all.</p>

<p>Django uses sqlalchemy for it's ORM but using it by itself lets you use it's full power</p>

<p>here's a small example on creating and selecting orm objects</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; ed_user = User('ed', 'Ed Jones', 'edspassword')
&gt;&gt;&gt; session.add(ed_user)
&gt;&gt;&gt; our_user = session.query(User).filter_by(name='ed').first() 
&gt;&gt;&gt; our_user
    &lt;User('ed','Ed Jones', 'edspassword')&gt;
</code></pre>
