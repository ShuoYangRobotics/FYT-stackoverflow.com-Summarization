<h3>Question (ID-273192):</h3><h2>Python: Best way to create directory if it doesn't exist for file write?</h2><p>What's the most elegant way to check if the directory a file is going to be written to exists, and if not create the directory? Is there a better way than:</p>

<p>Update: Somehow I'd missed os.path.exists, thanks kanja, Blair, and Douglas, this is what I've got now:</p>

<pre><code>def ensure_dir(f):
    d = os.path.dirname(f)
    if not os.path.exists(d):
        os.makedirs(d)
</code></pre>

<p>There's no magic flag to "open" that automatically does this, is there?</p>

<p>Initial attempt:</p>

<pre><code>filename = "/my/directory/filename.txt"
dir = os.path.dirname(filename)

try:
    os.stat(dir)
except:
    os.path.mkdir(dir)

f = file(filename)
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I see two answers with good qualities, each with a small flaw, so I'll give my take on it:</p>

<p>Try <code>os.path.exists</code>, and consider <code>os.makedirs</code> for the creation.</p>

<pre><code>if not os.path.exists(dir):
    os.makedirs(dir)
</code></pre>

<p>As noted in comments and elsewhere, there's a race condition - if the directory is created between the <code>os.path.exists</code> and the <code>os.makedirs</code> calls, the <code>os.makedirs</code> will fail with an <code>OSError</code>. Unfortunately, blanket-catching <code>OSError</code> and continuing is not foolproof, as it will ignore a failure to create the directory due to other factors, such as insufficient permissions, full disk, etc.</p>

<p>One option would be to trap the <code>OSError</code> and examine the embedded error code, if one knew what's what (on my OS, 13 seems to indicate that permission is denied, and 17 that the file exists - it's not clear that that's even remotely portable, but is explored in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/273698/is-there-a-cross-platform-way-of-getting-information-from-pythons-oserror">Is there a cross-platform way of getting information from Pythonâ€™s OSError</a>). Alterntively, there could be a second <code>os.path.exists</code>, but suppose another created the directory after the first check, then removed it before the second one - we could still be fooled. </p>

<p>Depending on the application, the danger of concurrent operations may be more or less than the danger posed by other factors such as file permissions. The developer would have to know more about the particular application being developed and its expected environment before choosing an implementation.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Using try except and the right error code from errno module gets rid of the race condition and is cross-platform:</p>

<pre><code>import os, errno
try:
    os.makedirs('a/b/c')
except OSError, e:
    if e.errno != errno.EEXIST:
        raise
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, we try to create the directories, but if they already exist we ignore the error. On the other hand, any other error gets reported. For example, if you create dir 'a' beforehand and remove all permissions from it, you will get an OSError raised with errno.EACCES (Permission denied, error 13).</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Check out <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/lib/os-file-dir.html" rel="nofollow">os.makedirs</a>:  (It makes sure the complete path exists.)  To handle the fact the directory might exist, catch OSError.</p>

<pre><code>import os
try:
    os.makedirs('./path/to/somewhere')
except OSError:
    pass
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Granted.. this question has long since been answered, but I'll throw in my two cents.</p>

<p>I would personally recommend that you use <code>os.path.isdir()</code> to test instead of <code>os.path.exists()</code>.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; os.path.exists('/tmp/dirname')
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; os.path.exists('/tmp/dirname/filename.etc')
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; os.path.isdir('/tmp/dirname/filename.etc')
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; os.path.isdir('/tmp/fakedirname')
False
</code></pre>

<p>If you have:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; dir = raw_input(":: ")
</code></pre>

<p>And a foolish user inputs:</p>

<pre><code>:: /tmp/dirname/filename.etc
</code></pre>

<p>... You're going to end up with a directory named <code>filename.etc</code> when you pass that arg to <code>os.makedirs()</code> if you test with <code>os.path.exists()</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Ok, sorry, I made too many comments, I guess I should put it down. It's not totally foolproof though.</p>

<pre><code>import os

dirname = 'create/me'

try:
    os.makedirs(dirname)
except OSError:
    if os.path.exists(dirname):
        # We are nearly safe
        pass
    else:
        # There was an error on creation, so make sure we know about it
        raise
</code></pre>

<p>Now as I say, this is not really foolproof, because we have the possiblity of failing to create the directory, and another process creating it during that period. I think I will ask the proper remainder as a question, as to whether the OSError codes can be used cross-platform.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>try the os.path.exists function</p>

<pre><code>if not os.path.exists(dir):
 os.path.mkdir(dir)
</code></pre>
