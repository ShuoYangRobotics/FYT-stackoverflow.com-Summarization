<h3>Question (ID-159720):</h3><h2>What is the naming convention in Python for variable and function names?</h2><p>Coming from a C# background the naming convention for variables and method names are usually either CamelCase or Pascal Case:</p>

<pre><code>// C# example
string thisIsMyVariable = "a"
public void ThisIsMyMethod()
</code></pre>

<p>In Python, I have seen the above but I have also seen underscores being used:</p>

<pre><code># python example
this_is_my_variable = 'a'
def this_is_my_function():
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a more preferable, definitive coding style for Python?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Function names should be lowercase,
  with words separated by underscores as
  necessary to improve readability.</p>
  
  <p>mixedCase is allowed only in contexts
  where that's already the prevailing
  style</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Variables...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use the function naming rules:
  lowercase with words separated by
  underscores as necessary to improve
  readability.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Personally, I deviate from this because I also prefer <code>mixedCase</code> over <code>lower_case</code> for my own projects.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>David Goodger (in "Code Like a Pythonista" <a href="http://python.net/~goodger/projects/pycon/2007/idiomatic/handout.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>)  describes the PEP 8 recommendations as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>joined_lower</code> for functions, methods,
attributes</p></li>
<li><p><code>joined_lower</code> or <code>ALL_CAPS</code> for
constants</p></li>
<li><p><code>StudlyCaps</code> for classes</p></li>
<li><p><code>camelCase</code> only to conform to
pre-existing conventions</p></li>
</ul>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>There is <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow">PEP 8</a>, as other answers show, but PEP 8 is only the styleguide for the standard library, and it's only taken as gospel therein. One of the most frequent deviations of PEP 8 for other pieces of code is the variable naming, specifically for methods. There is no single predominate style, although considering the volume of code that uses mixedCase, if one were to make a strict census one would probably end up with a version of PEP 8 with mixedCase. There is little other deviation from PEP 8 that is quite as common.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>As mentioned, PEP 8 says to use <code>lower_case_with_underscores</code> for variables, methods and functions.</p>

<p>I prefer using <code>lower_case_with_underscores</code> for variables and <code>mixedCase</code> for methods and functions makes the code more explicit and readable.  Thus following the <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/" rel="nofollow">Zen of Python's</a> "explicit is better than implicit" and "Readability counts"</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Most python guys prefer underscores, but even I am using python since more than 5 years right now, I still do not like them. They just look ugly to me, but maybe that's all the Java in my head. </p>

<p>I simply like CamelCase better since it fits better with the way classes are named, It feels more logical to have <code>SomeClass.doSomething()</code> than <code>SomeClass.do_something()</code>. If you look around in the global module index in python, you will find both, which is due to the fact that it's a collection of libraries from various sources that grew overtime and not something that was developed by one company like Sun with strict coding rules. I would say the bottom line is: Use whatever you like better, it's just a question of personal taste.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>As the <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow">Style Guide for Python Code</a> admits,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The naming conventions of Python's
  library are a bit of a mess, so we'll
  never get this completely consistent</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that this refers just to Python's <em>standard library</em>. If they can't get <em>that</em> consistent, then there hardly is much hope of having a generally-adhered-to convention for <em>all</em> Python code, is there?</p>

<p>From that, and the discussion here, I would deduct that it's <strong>not</strong> a horrible sin if one keeps using e.g. Java's or C#'s (clear and well-established) naming conventions for variables and functions when crossing over to Python. Keeping in mind, of course, that it is best to abide with whatever the prevailing style for a codebase / project / team happens to be. As the Python Style Guide points out, <em>internal consistency</em> matters most.</p>

<p><sup>Feel free to dismiss me as a heretic. :-) Like the OP, I'm not a "Pythonista", not yet anyway.</sup></p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Personally I try to use CamelCase for classes, mixedCase methods and functions. Variables are usually underscore separated (when I can remember). This way I can tell at a glance what exactly I'm calling, rather than everything looking the same.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>Typically, one follow the conventions used in the language's standard library.</p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>The coding style is usually part of an organization's internal policy/convention standards, but I think in general, the all-lower-case-underscore-separator style is most common in python. </p>
