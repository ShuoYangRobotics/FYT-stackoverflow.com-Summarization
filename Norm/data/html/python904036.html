<h3>Question (ID-904036):</h3><h2>Chain-calling parent constructors in python</h2><p>Consider this - a base class A, class B inheriting from A, class C inheriting from B. What is a generic way to call a parent class constructor in a constructor? If this still sounds too vague, here's some code.</p>

<pre><code>class A(object):
    def __init__(self):
        print "Constructor A was called"

class B(A):
    def __init__(self):
        super(B,self).__init__()
        print "Constructor B was called"

class C(B):
    def __init__(self):
        super(C,self).__init__()
        print "Constructor C was called"

c = C()
</code></pre>

<p>This is how I do it now. But it still seems a bit too non-generic - you still must pass a correct type by hand.</p>

<p>Now, I've tried using <code>self.__class__</code> as a first argument to super(), but, obviously it doesn't work - if you put it in the constructor for C - fair enough, B's constructor gets called. If you do the same in B, "self" still points to an instance of C so you end up calling B's constructor again (this ends in an infinite recursion).</p>

<p>There is no need to think about diamond inheritance for now, I am just interested in solving this specific problem.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-3):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The way you are doing it is indeed the recommended one (for Python 2.x). </p>

<p>The issue of whether the class is passed explicitly to <code>super</code> is a matter of style rather than functionality. Passing the class to <code>super</code> fits in with Python's philosophy of "explicit is better than implicit".</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Python 3 includes an improved super() which allows use like this:</p>

<pre><code>super().__init__(args)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>This version for python 2.x does not hard-code the class name:</p>

<pre><code>super(self.__class__,self).__init__(....
</code></pre>
