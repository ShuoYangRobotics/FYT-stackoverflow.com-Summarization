<h3>Question (ID-437589):</h3><h2>How do I unload (reload) a Python module?</h2><p>I have a long-running python server and would like to be able to upgrade a service without restarting the server.  What's the best way do do this?</p>

<pre><code>if foo.py has changed:
    unimport foo  &lt;-- how do I do this?
    import foo
    myfoo=foo.Foo()
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You can reload a module when it has already been imported by using the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html?highlight=reload#reload" rel="nofollow">reload</a> builtin function:</p>

<pre><code>import foo

while True:
    # Do some things.
    if is_changed(foo):
        foo = reload(foo)
</code></pre>

<p>I think that this is what you want. Web servers like Django's development server use this so that you can see the effects of your code changes without restarting the server process itself.</p>

<p>To quote from the docs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Python modules’ code is recompiled and
  the module-level code reexecuted,
  defining a new set of objects which
  are bound to names in the module’s
  dictionary. The init function of
  extension modules is not called a
  second time. As with all other objects
  in Python the old objects are only
  reclaimed after their reference counts
  drop to zero. The names in the module
  namespace are updated to point to any
  new or changed objects. Other
  references to the old objects (such as
  names external to the module) are not
  rebound to refer to the new objects
  and must be updated in each namespace
  where they occur if that is desired.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you noted in your question, you'll have to reconstruct <code>Foo</code> objects if the <code>Foo</code> class resides in the <code>foo</code> module.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>In Python 3, you want:</p>

<pre><code>import imp
imp.reload(foo)
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2008-February/008421.html" rel="nofollow">As per the BDFL</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>To cover my shame, here is a Python list thread that discusses how to delete a module.  </p>

<p>The summary:  it can be especially difficult if the module is not pure python.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.velocityreviews.com/forums/t326253-how-do-i-really-delete-an-imported-module.html" rel="nofollow">How do I really delete an imported module</a> | <a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2003-December/241654.html" rel="nofollow">former (dead) link</a></p>

<p>In particular:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can use sys.getrefcount() to find out the actual number of
  references.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; import sys, empty, os
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; sys.getrefcount(sys) 9
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; sys.getrefcount(os) 6
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; sys.getrefcount(empty) 3
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Numbers greater than 3 indicate that
  it will be hard to get rid of the
  module. The homegrown "empty"
  (containing nothing) module should be
  garbage collected after</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; del sys.modules["empty"]
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; del empty
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>as the third reference is an artifact
  of the getrefcount() function.</p>
</blockquote>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>reload(module), but only if it's completely stand-alone. If anything else has a reference to the module (or any object belonging to the module), then you'll get subtle and curious errors caused by the old code hanging around longer than you expected, and things like isinstance not working across different versions of the same code.</p>

<p>If you have one-way dependencies, you must also reload all modules that depend on the the reloaded module to get rid of all the references to the old code. And then reload modules that depend on the reloaded modules, recursively.</p>

<p>If you have circular dependencies, which is very common for example when you are dealing with reloading a package, you must unload all the modules in the group in one go. You can't do this with reload() because it will re-import each module before its dependencies have been refreshed, allowing old references to creep into new modules.</p>

<p>The only way to do it in this case is to hack sys.modules, which is kind of unsupported. You'd have to go through and delete each sys.modules entry you wanted to be reloaded on next import, and also delete entries whose values are None to deal with an implementation issue to do with cacheing failed relative imports. It's not terribly nice but as long as you have a fully self-contained set of dependencies that doesn't leave references outside its codebase, it's workable.</p>

<p>It's probably best to restart the server. :-)</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><pre><code>if 'myModule' in sys.modules:  
    del(sys.modules["myModule"]) 
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>For those like me who want to unload all modules (when running in Python interpreter under emacs):</p>

<pre><code>   for mod in sys.modules.values():
      reload(mod)
</code></pre>

<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>If you want things out of the namespace, just do:</p>

<pre><code>del foo
</code></pre>

<p>and it's gone.  In some environments (like IPython) this doesn't always remove everything.  </p>
