<h3>Question (ID-681953):</h3><h2>Python Class Decorator</h2><p>In Python 2.5, is there a way to create a decorator that decorates a class?  Specifically, I want to use a decorator to add a member to a class and change the constructor to take a value for that member.</p>

<p>Looking for something like the following (which has a syntax error on 'class Foo:':</p>

<pre><code>def getId(self): return self.__id

class addID(original_class):
    def __init__(self, id, *args, **kws):
        self.__id = id
        self.getId = getId
        original_class.__init__(self, *args, **kws)

@addID
class Foo:
    def __init__(self, value1):
        self.value1 = value1

if __name__ == '__main__':
    foo1 = Foo(5,1)
    print foo1.value1, foo1.getId()
    foo2 = Foo(15,2)
    print foo2.value1, foo2.getId()
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks,
Rob</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
Rereading this question, I guess what I'm really after is a way to do something like a C# interface in Python.  I need to switch my paradigm I suppose.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-3):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Apart from the question whether class decorators are the right solution to your problem:</p>

<p>in Python 2.6 and higher, there are class decorators with the @-syntax, so you can write:</p>

<pre><code>@addID
class Foo:
    pass
</code></pre>

<p>in older versions, you can do it another way:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo:
    pass

Foo = addID(Foo)
</code></pre>

<p>Note however that this works the same as for function decorators, and that the decorator should return the new (or modified original) class, which is not what you're doing in the example. The addID decorator would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>def addID(original_class):
    orig_init = original_class.__init__
    # make copy of original __init__, so we can call it without recursion

    def __init__(self, id, *args, **kws):
        self.__id = id
        self.getId = getId
        orig_init(self, *args, **kws) # call the original __init__

    original_class.__init__ = __init__ # set the class' __init__ to the new one
    return original_class
</code></pre>

<p>You could then use the appropriate syntax for your python version as described above.</p>

<p>But I agree with others that inheritance is better suited if you want to override <code>__init__</code>.</p>

<p>UPDATE: changed to correct the issue Gerald mentioned in comment.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I would second the notion that you may wish to consider a subclass instead of the approach you've outlined. However, not knowing your specific scenario, YMMV :-)</p>

<p>What you're thinking of is a metaclass. The <code>__new__</code> function in a metaclass is passed the full proposed definition of the class, which it can then rewrite before the class is created. You can, at that time, sub out the constructor for a new one.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>def substitute_init(self, id, *args, **kwargs):
    pass

class FooMeta(type):

    def __new__(cls, name, bases, attrs):
        attrs['__init__'] = substitute_init
        return super(FooMeta, cls).__new__(cls, name, bases, attrs)

class Foo(object):

    __metaclass__ = FooMeta

    def __init__(self, value1):
        pass
</code></pre>

<p>Replacing the constructor is perhaps a bit dramatic, but the language does provide support for this kind of deep introspection and dynamic modification.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>That's not a good practice and there is no mechanism to do that because of that. The right way to accomplish what you want is inheritance.</p>

<p>Take a look into the <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/classes.html#inheritance" rel="nofollow">class documentation</a>.</p>

<p>A little example:</p>

<pre><code>class Employee(object):

    def __init__(self, age, sex, siblings=0):
        self.age = age
        self.sex = sex    
        self.siblings = siblings

    def born_on(self):    
        today = datetime.date.today()

        return today - datetime.timedelta(days=self.age*365)


class Boss(Employee):    
    def __init__(self, age, sex, siblings=0, bonus=0):
        self.bonus = bonus
        Employee.__init__(self, age, sex, siblings)
</code></pre>

<p>This way Boss has everything <code>Employee</code> has, with also his own <strong><code>__init__</code></strong> method and own members.</p>
