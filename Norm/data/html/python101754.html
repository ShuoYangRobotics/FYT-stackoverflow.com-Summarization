<h3>Question (ID-101754):</h3><h2>Is there any way to run Python on Android?</h2><p>I like the Android platform. Actually, with some friends, we even participate to the ADC with the Spoxt project.</p>

<p>But Java is not my favourite language at all. We are working on a S60 version and this platform has a nice Python API. Of course there is nothing official about Python on Android, but since Jython exists, does anybody know a way to let the snake and the robot work together ?</p>

<p>An example <a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/android-barcode-scanner/" rel="nofollow">via Matt Cutts</a> -- "hereâ€™s a barcode scanner written in six lines of Python code:</p>

<pre><code>import android
droid = android.Android()
code = droid.scanBarcode()
isbn = int(code['result']['SCAN_RESULT'])
url = "http://books.google.com?q=%d" % isbn
droid.startActivity('android.intent.action.VIEW', url)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I just posted some <a href="http://www.damonkohler.com/2008/12/python-on-android.html" rel="nofollow">directions for cross compiling Python 2.4.5 for Android</a>. It takes some patching, and not all modules are supported, but the basics are there.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p><em>"The <a href="http://www.renpy.org/pygame/">Pygame Subset for Android</a> is a port of a subset of Pygame functionality to the Android platform. The goal of the project is to allow the creation of Android-specific games, and to ease the porting of games from PC-like platforms to Android."</em></p>

<p>The examples include a complete game packaged in an APK, which is pretty interesting. </p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>As a python lover and Android programmer, I am sad to say this is not really a good way to go. There's two problems.</p>

<p>One problem is that there is a lot more than just a programming language to the Android development tools. A lot of the Android graphics involve XML files to configure the display, similar to HTML. The built-in java objects are really integrated with this XML layout, and it's a lot easier than writing your own code to go from logic to bitmap.</p>

<p>The other problem is that the G1 (and probably other android devices for the near future) are really not that fast. 200 Mhz processors, and RAM is very limited. Even in Java you have to do a decent amount of rewriting-to-avoid-more-object-creation if you want to make your app perfectly smooth. Python is going to be too slow for a while still on mobile devices.</p>

<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Not at the moment and you would be lucky to get Jython to work soon. If you're planning to start your development now you would be better of with just sticking to Java for now on.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>Given the Oracle lawsuit, lets just lobby Google to replace Dalvik with Pylvik and be rid of Larry and the J2me, which I've seen called an overly verbose mess by people who gave impressive code examples...</p>

<p>I guess there's ASE<a href="http://www.thebitsource.com/programming-software-development/android/python-jruby-on-the-android-platform-in-10-steps/" rel="nofollow">and this 10-step instruction</a>    <a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/android-barcode-scanner/" rel="nofollow">and this cool example</a>
