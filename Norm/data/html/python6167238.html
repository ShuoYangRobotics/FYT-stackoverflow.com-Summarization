<h3>Question (ID-6167238):</h3><h2>What does [:] in Python mean</h2><p>I'm analyzing some Python code and I don't know what </p>

<pre><code>pop = population[:]
</code></pre>

<p>means. Is it something like array lists in Java or like a bi-dimensional array?
Could appreciate some help, thanks.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-4):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>It's a slicing, and what it does depends on the type of <code>population</code>.  If <code>population</code> is a list, this line will create a copy of the list.  For an object of type <code>tuple</code> or a <code>str</code>, it will do nothing (the line will do the same without <code>[:]</code>), and for a (say) NumPy array, it will create a new view to the same data.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>It might also help to know that a list slice in general makes a copy of part of the list. E.g. <code>population[2:4]</code> will return a list containing population[2] and population[3] (slicing is right-exclusive). Leaving away the left and right index, as in <code>population[:]</code> they default to 0 and length(population) respectively, thereby selecting the entire list. Hence this is a common idiom to make a copy of a list.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>It is a <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/introduction.html#lists" rel="nofollow">slice</a> from the beginning of the sequence to the end, usually producing a shallow copy.</p>

<p>(Well, it's <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getitem__" rel="nofollow">more than that</a>, but you don't need to care yet.)</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>It creates a copy of the list, versus just assigning a new name for the already existing list.</p>
