<h3>Question (ID-6999522):</h3><h2>Python line-by-line memory profiler?</h2><p>I'm looking to generate, from a large Python codebase, a summary of heap usage or memory allocations over the course of a function's run.</p>

<p>I'm familiar with <a href="http://guppy-pe.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">heapy</a>, and it's served me well for taking "snapshots" of the heap at particular points in my code, but I've found it difficult to generate a "memory-over-time" summary with it. I've also played with <a href="http://packages.python.org/line_profiler/" rel="nofollow">line_profiler</a>, but that works with run time, not memory.</p>

<p>My fallback right now is Valgrind with <a href="http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/ms-manual.html" rel="nofollow">massif</a>, but that lacks a lot of the contextual Python information that both Heapy and line_profiler give. Is there some sort of combination of the latter two that give a sense of memory usage or heap growth over the execution span of a Python program?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-1):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I would use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/sys.html#sys.settrace" rel="nofollow"><code>sys.settrace</code></a>  at program startup to register a custom tracer function. The custom_trace_function will be called for each line of code. Then you can use that function to store information gathered by heapy or <a href="https://launchpad.net/meliae" rel="nofollow">meliae</a> in a file for later processing. </p>

<p>Here is a very simple example which logs the output of hpy.heap() each second to a plain text file:</p>

<pre><code>import sys
import time
import atexit
from guppy import hpy

_last_log_time = time.time()
_logfile = open('logfile.txt', 'w')

def heapy_profile(frame, event, arg):
    currtime = time.time()
    if currtime - _last_log_time &lt; 1:
        return
    _last_log_time = currtime
    code = frame.f_code
    filename = code.co_filename
    lineno = code.co_firstlineno
    idset = hpy().heap()
    logfile.write('%s %s:%s\n%s\n\n' % (currtime, filename, lineno, idset))
    logfile.flush()

atexit.register(_logfile.close)
sys.settrace(heapy_profile)
</code></pre>
