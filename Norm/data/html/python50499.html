<h3>Question (ID-50499):</h3><h2>In Python, how do I get the path and name of the file that is currently executing?</h2><p>I have scripts calling other script files but I need to get the filepath of the file that is currently running within the process. 
For example, let's say I have three files. Using <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#execfile" rel="nofollow">execfile</a>, script_1.py calls script_2.py. In turn, script_2.py calls script_3.py. How can I get the file name and path of <strong>script_3.py</strong> *from code within script_3.py* without having to pass that info as args from script_2.py?
(Executing os.getcwd() returns the original starting script's filepath not the current file's.)</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-12):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p><code>__file__</code> is the answer, however, it is relative to the path, so you'll need to use    <code>os.path.abspath(__file__)</code> to get the actual path to the file</p>

<p>e.g.</p>

<pre><code>import os

def h():
    print os.path.abspath( __file__ )
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>p1.py:</p>

<pre><code>execfile("p2.py")
</code></pre>

<p>p2.py:</p>

<pre><code>import inspect
print inspect.getfile( inspect.currentframe() )
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>It's not entirely clear what you mean by "the filepath of the file that is currently running within the process".
<code>sys.argv[0]</code> usually contains the location of the script that was invoked by the Python interpreter.
Check the <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-sys.html" rel="nofollow">sys documentation</a> for more details.</p>

<p>As @<a href="#50521" rel="nofollow">Tim</a> and @<a href="#50505" rel="nofollow">Pat Notz</a> have pointed out, the __file__ attribute provides access to</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the file from which the module was
  loaded, if it was loaded from a file</p>
</blockquote>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The suggestions marked as best are all true if your script consists of only one file. </p>

<p>If you want to find out the name of the executable (i.e. the root file passed to the python interpreter for the current program) from a file that may be imported as a module, you need to do this (let's assume this is in a file named <em>foo.py</em>):</p>

<p><code>import inspect</code></p>

<p><code>print inspect.stack()[-1][1]</code></p>

<p>Because the last thing (<code>[-1]</code>) on the stack is the first thing that went into it (stacks are LIFO/FILO data structures).</p>

<p>Then in file <em>bar.py</em> if you <code>import foo</code> it'll print <em>bar.py</em>, rather than <em>foo.py</em>, which would be the value of all of these:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>__file__</code></li>
<li><code>inspect.getfile(inspect.currentframe())</code></li>
<li><code>inspect.stack()[0][1]</code></li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>The "<strong>file</strong>" attribute works for both the file containing the main execution code as well as imported modules <a href="http://pyref.infogami.com/__file__" rel="nofollow">http://pyref.infogami.com/__file__</a></p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><pre><code>import sys
print sys.argv[0]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I think it's just <code>__file__</code>   Sounds like you may also want to checkout the <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-inspect.html" rel="nofollow">inspect module</a>.</p>

<p>Ugh. Stupid markdown... try "underscore underscore file underscore underscore"</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>You can use inspect.stack()</p>

<pre><code>import inspect
inspect.stack()[0]  =&gt; (&lt;frame object at 0x00AC2AC0&gt;, 'g:\\Python\\Test\\_GetCurrentProgram.py', 15, '&lt;module&gt;', ['print inspect.stack()[0]\n'], 0)
os.path.abspath (inspect.stack()[0][1]) =&gt; 'g:\\Python\\Test\\_GetCurrentProgram.py'
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p><code>__file__</code> as others have said. You may want to use <code>os.realpath(__file__)</code>, however, in case it's a symlink</p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><pre><code>import sys

print sys.path[0]
</code></pre>

<p>this would print the path of the currently executing script</p>
<br /><b>#10</b><br /><p>I used the approach with __file__<br>
<code>os.path.abspath(__file__)</code><br>
but there is a little trick, it returns the .py file 
when the code is run the first time, 
next runs give the name of *.pyc file<br>
so I stayed with:<br>
<code>inspect.getfile(inspect.currentframe())</code><br>
or<br>
<code>sys._getframe().f_code.co_filename</code>  </p>
<br /><b>#11</b><br /><p>I think this is cleaner:</p>

<pre><code>print inspect.stack()[0][1]
</code></pre>

<p>and gets the same information as:</p>

<pre><code>print inspect.getfile(inspect.currentframe())
</code></pre>

<p>Where [0] is the current frame in the stack (top of stack) and [1] is for the file name, increase to go backwards in the stack i.e.</p>

<pre><code>print inspect.stack()[1][1]
</code></pre>

<p>would be the file name of the script that called the current frame. Also, using [-1] will get you to the bottom of the stack, the original calling script.</p>
