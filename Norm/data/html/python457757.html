<h3>Question (ID-457757):</h3><h2>What is the best Python book for experienced programmers?</h2><p>I am a fairly experienced programmer, mostly C, C++, Java and C#... 
Can you recommend any Python books that would help me to get the most out of my existing experience? Many Python books that I have read good reviews about seem to be aimed at the novice programmer - I'd like to find something that "gets right down to business".
There are many good resources on the web of course, but I would like to have a real book that possibly goes a bit into detail about specific concepts, techniques and patterns that are specific to Python.</p>

<p>It is not a book but for experienced programmer it contains more than most books.</p>

<p>O'Reilly Programming Python (third edition) is good, but very long, and I am not sure when it is a tutorial and when it is a reference.</p>

<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I'm not much for fancy book lernin', so I usually stick to the tutorials off the Python website.</p>

<p>Start with the python <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/tutorial/</a>, get as far as you can go without boring yourself, and then just use the library (<a href="http://docs.python.org/library/" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/library/</a>) for reference.</p>

<p>Good luck learning - it's a fantastic language. It's basically pseudocode that's not so pseudo!</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>You could take a look at the fresh <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/expert-python-programming/book" rel="nofollow">Expert_Python_Programming</a> or <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0596009259" rel="nofollow">Programming_Python</a> does a very good job.</p>

<p>[Edit]: I am not sure why it doesn't show up the links. :|<br />
[edit2] fixed -you had an extra "!" somehow</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>I sometimes like to graze the <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/langs/python/" rel="nofollow">Python Cookbook</a> over at ActiveState. It stirs my brain up and makes me think of things in ways I normally wouldn't. Recipes by certain contributors (e.g. <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/users/178123/" rel="nofollow">Raymond Hettinger</a>) are particularly instructive to study.</p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>A lot of people recommend <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0132269937" rel="nofollow">Core Python</a>.  I haven't ready many other Python books to compare it to, but I think it's well written.</p>

<p>The fellow who hosts the <a href="http://www.awaretek.com/python/" rel="nofollow">Python 411 podcast</a> says if he were stranded on a desert island with only one Python book, it would be Core Python.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: My favorite Python book is now <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0672329786" rel="nofollow">Python Essential Reference</a>.  It's pace is more suitable for experienced programmers than that of Core Python. Also, it covers things beyond language syntax that are hard to find in other Python books.</p>
<br /><b>#10</b><br /><p>Coming from Java (and occasional Bash scripting), and learning how to do basic stuff in Python a while back, I had two books available to me at work:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596100469/" rel="nofollow">Python in a Nutshell</a> (Bought at my suggestion, because after comparing Python books online I thought this would be just what I needed)</li>
<li><a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596513986/" rel="nofollow">Learning Python</a> (Linking to latest edition, but I think we had the 1st ed)</li>
</ol>

<p>Unexpectedly, I found myself more frequently using <strong>Learning Python</strong>, even though it seems much more like it's "aimed at the novice programmer"; something I was not, really. I just noticed I found the basic syntax stuff and examples I needed faster in that book. </p>

<p>Just my 2 cents about these 2 books. :) It may well be that <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596009250/index.html" rel="nofollow">Programming Python</a> or some such is what <em>you</em> need.</p>
<br /><b>#11</b><br /><p>I guess what you are looking for is more a syntactic book that will tell you how to do something you already understand. The best I can recommend for this is a small tutorial on the Internet. Something like Advanced Python will get you to the point and if you have further questions, you just have to read the documentation.</p>
<br /><b>#12</b><br /><p>People still read books?</p>

<p>I'd recommend going through a tutorial. When you finish or get tired of it, use Stack Overflow and Google to resolve questions you have about the language as they come up.</p>

<p>Here's the official tutorial:</p>
