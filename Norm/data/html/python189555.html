<h3>Question (ID-189555):</h3><h2>How to use Python to login to a webpage and retrieve cookies for later usage?</h2><p>I want to download and parse webpage using python, but to access it I need a couple of cookies set. Therefore I need to login over https to the webpage first. The login moment involves sending two POST params (username, password) to /login.php. During the login request I want to retrieve the cookies from the response header and store them so I can use them in the request to download the webpage /data.php.</p>

<p>How would I do this in python (preferably 2.6)? If possible I only want to use builtin modules.</p>

username = 'myuser'
password = 'mypassword'

cj = cookielib.CookieJar()
opener = urllib2.build_opener(urllib2.HTTPCookieProcessor(cj))
login_data = urllib.urlencode({'username' : username, 'j_password' : password})
opener.open('http://www.example.com/login.php', login_data)
resp = opener.open('http://www.example.com/hiddenpage.php')
print resp.read()
</code></pre>

<p><code>resp.read()</code> is the straight html of the page you want to open, and you can use <code>opener</code> to view any page using your session cookie.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Almost, but resp will just print the file descriptor
try print resp.readLines()</p>
