<h3>Question (ID-377017):</h3><h2>Test if executable exists in Python?</h2><p>In python, is there a portable and simple way to test if an executable program exists?</p>

<p>By simple I mean something like the '<code>which</code>' command which would be just perfect. I don't want to search PATH manually or something involving trying to execute it with <code>Popen</code> &amp; al and see if it fails (that's what I'm doing now, but imagine it's <code>launchmissiles</code>)</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> The answer is '<strong>No</strong>', from the different posts, I just have to search path manually ans use Jay's answer (sorry for the bad formulation about 'which' which I understand, but I thought maybe there's something in os.path that does that though named strangely). </p>

<pre><code>def which(program):
    import os
    def is_exe(fpath):
        return os.path.exists(fpath) and os.access(fpath, os.X_OK)

    fpath, fname = os.path.split(program)
    if fpath:
        if is_exe(program):
            return program
    else:
        for path in os.environ["PATH"].split(os.pathsep):
            exe_file = os.path.join(path, program)
            if is_exe(exe_file):
                return exe_file

    return None
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Updated code sample to include logic for handling case where provided argument is already a full path to the executable, i.e. "which /bin/ls". This mimics the behavior of the UNIX 'which' command.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>See <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/os.path.html#module-os.path" rel="nofollow">os.path</a> module for some useful functions on pathnames. To check if an existing file is executable, use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/os.html#os.access" rel="nofollow">os.access(path, mode)</a>, with the os.X_OK mode.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>os.X_OK</p>
  
  <p>Value to include in the mode parameter of access() to determine if path can be executed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> The suggested <code>which()</code> implementations are missing one clue - using <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/os.path.html#os.path.join" rel="nofollow"><code>os.path.join()</code></a> to build full file names.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Just remember to specify the file extension on windows. Otherwise, you have to write a much complicated <code>is_exe</code> for windows using <code>PATHEXT</code> environment variable. You may just want to use <a href="http://www.raboof.com/projects/findpath/" rel="nofollow">FindPath</a>.</p>

<p>OTOH, why are you even bothering to search for the executable? The operating system will do it for you as part of <code>popen</code> call &amp; will raise an exception if the executable is not found. All you need to do is catch the correct exception for given OS. Note that on Windows, <code>subprocess.Popen(exe, shell=True)</code> will fail silently if <code>exe</code> is not found.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>None of previous examples do work on all platforms. Usually they fail to work on Windows because you can execute without the file extension <em>and</em> that you can register new extension. For example on Windows if python is well installed it's enough to execute 'file.py' and it will work.</p>

<p>The only valid and portable solution I had was to execute the command and see error code. Any decent executable should have a set of calling parameters that will do nothing.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>you can tell if a file exists with the os module.  an executable in particular seems quite unportable considering lots of things are executable on nix that aren't on windows and vice versa.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>It would seem the <em>obvious</em> choice is "which", parsing the results via popen,  but you could simulate it otherwise using the os class.  In pseudopython, it would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>for each element r in path:
    for each file f in directory p:
        if f is executable:
           return True
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>So basically you want to find a file in mounted filesystem (not necessarily in PATH directories only) and check if it is executable. This translates to following plan: </p>

<ul>
<li>enumerate all files in locally mounted filesystems</li>
<li>match results with name pattern</li>
<li>for each file found check if it is executable</li>
</ul>

<p>I'd say, doing this in a portable way will require lots of computing power and time. Is it really what you need?</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>There is a <a href="http://svn.python.org/view/python/trunk/Tools/scripts/which.py?view=markup" rel="nofollow">which.py</a> script in a standard Python distribution (e.g. on Windows <code>'\PythonXX\Tools\Scripts\which.py'</code>). </p>

<p>EDIT: <code>which.py</code> depends on <code>ls</code> therefore it is not cross-platform.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>If you have <code>bash</code> and a function <code>sh</code> (<code>subprocess.Popen( ... ).communicate()</code> ),<br />
use the <code>bash</code> builtin <code>type</code>:</p>

<pre><code>type -p ls  =&gt;  /bin/ls
type -p nonesuch  =&gt;  ""
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>An important question is "<strong>Why</strong> do you need to test if executable exist?" Maybe you don't? ;-) </p>

<p>Recently I needed this functionality to launch viewer for PNG file. I wanted to iterate over some predefined viewers and run the first that exists. Fortunately, I came across <code>os.startfile</code>. It's much better! Simple, portable and uses the <em>default</em> viewer on the system:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; os.startfile('yourfile.png')
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I was wrong about <code>os.startfile</code> being portable... It's Windows only. On Mac you have to run <code>open</code> command. And <code>xdg_open</code> on Unix. There's a <a href="http://bugs.python.org/issue3177" rel="nofollow">Python issue</a> on adding Mac and Unix support for <code>os.startfile</code>.</p>
