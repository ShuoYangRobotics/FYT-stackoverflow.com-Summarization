<h3>Question (ID-4941145):</h3><h2>Python Flask vs Bottle</h2><p>What are the large distinction between these two microframeworks? It seems Bottle is more flexible in terms of the templating engine and other configurations, but flask supports many useful plugins like flask-openID.</p>

<p>How are the fundamentally different, and why have they not merged?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-3):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The big difference is that Flask is based on other technologies such as Werkzeug and Jinja2 that exist for a longer time and it does not try to reinvent things.  Bottle on the other hand tries to stick to the one-file approach.  I want to merge them but the Bottle developer does not seem to be very happy about the idea of stepping away from the “one file” requirement.</p>

<p>Regarding flexibility: there are no reasons you shouldn't be able to use flask with other template engines if that's what you're after.  In fact, things like Flask-Genshi exist: <a href="http://packages.python.org/Flask-Genshi/" rel="nofollow">Flask-Genshi</a> and it's incredible easy to use mako with it, even without extension if you want to.</p>

<p>Bias warning: I am the developer of Flask, Werkzeug and Jinja2.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You might find <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/r1chardj0n3s/web-microframework-battle" rel="nofollow">this slideshow</a> that compares 10 micro frameworks (including Flask/Bottle)  of intrest.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>i pick bottle over flask any day, i just migrated from PHP am working on windows and the only framework thats not giving me a headache to set up is bottle, just install python and import bottle then run your app! simple as pie.+ not too verbosy just clean straight up code + most important i think its faster.
well on the other hand am ecstatic that you two brilliant developers could consider working together, what i have seen missing in both frameworks is a CRUD wrapper "in PHP we have millins of crud classes one can use to avoid writting the same code over and over" something like junos ,implementation.
the one file aspect is brilliant much like mojolicious::lite(Perl), F3 framework(PHP).awesome work guys! :)</p>
