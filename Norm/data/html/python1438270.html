<h3>Question (ID-1438270):</h3><h2>Installing Python Imaging Library (PIL) on Snow Leopard with updated Python 2.6.2</h2><p>I have a fresh install (started with a wiped drive) of Snow Leopard with the developer tools installed during the Snow Leopard installation. I then installed Python 2.6.2, replacing the Snow Leopard default python 2.6.1. I've tried to install PIL by (1) easy_install (2) pip and (3) downloading source and running "python setup.py build" manually. All yield the same error (link to pip log: <a href="http://drop.io/gi2bgw6" rel="nofollow">http://drop.io/gi2bgw6</a>). I've seen others have had success installing PIL using the Snow Leopard default python 2.6.1, so I'm not sure why I'm having so much trouble getting it to work with 2.6.2. Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-10):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The python.org Python was built with an earlier gcc. Try using gcc-4.0 instead of SL's default of 4.2:</p>

<pre><code>export CC=/usr/bin/gcc-4.0
</code></pre>

<p>See similar problem <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.apple/16087" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>That gets past the stdarg problem.  You may then run into later build problems with various dependent libraries.</p>

<p>BTW, gcc-4.0 and gcc-4.2 are both included with Snow Leopard's Xcode <em>3</em> so no additional installs are needed.</p>

<p>UPDATED 2011-05:  Note, that the newer Xcode <em>4</em>, released for experimental use with 10.6 and expected to be standard with 10.7, no longer includes PPC support so, if you install Xcode 4, this suggestion will not work.  Options include using the newer 64-bit/32-bin Python 2.7.x installers from python.org or installing a newer Python 2.6 and PIL and the various 3rd-party libs using MacPorts, Homebrew, or Fink.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The problem I ran into was that PIL was being compiled against PowerPC architecture (-arch ppc).</p>

<p>Do this before setup/build/compile:</p>

<pre><code>export ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386"
</code></pre>

<p>(Assuming you're on i386)</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><h1>Modified Answer</h1>

<p>Here are the steps that I took to successfully install PIL on Mac OS X 10.6 (without using MacPorts or Fink).</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Install readline</p>

<pre><code>cd ~/src
curl -O ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/pub/bash/readline-6.0.tar.gz
tar -xvzf readline-6.0.tar.gz
cd readline-6.0
./configure  
make  
sudo make install
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Install gbdm</p>

<pre><code>cd ~/src
curl -O ftp://mirror.anl.gov/pub/gnu/gdbm/gdbm-1.8.3.tar.gz
tar -xvzf gbdm-1.8.3.tar.gz
cd gdbm-1.8.3
# Need to modify Makefile.in
perl -pi -e 's/BINOWN = bin/BINOWN = root/' Makefile.in
perl -pi -e 's/BINGRP = bin/BINGRP = wheel/' Makefile.in
./configure
make
sudo make install
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Compile the latest Python 2.6.2+ from the Mercurial Repo</p>

<pre><code>cd ~/development
hg clone http://code.python.org/hg/branches/release2.6-maint/ python-release2.6-maint.hg
cd python-release2.6-main.hg
./configure --enable-framework MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.6
make
sudo make frameworkinstall
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: I did receive the following errors after running <code>make</code>. However, I continued on as I wasn't worried about missing these modules, and I was able to successfully install PIL.</p>

<pre><code>Failed to find the necessary bits to build these modules:
_bsddb             dl                 imageop

sunaudiodev                                           
To find the necessary bits, look in setup.py in detect_modules() for the module's name.

</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Update .bash_profile for the new Python 2.6.2+ and for virtualenvwrapper</p>

<pre><code># Set PATH for MacPython 2.6 if Python2.6 is installed
if [ -x /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/bin/python2.6 ]; then
    PATH="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/bin:${PATH}"
    export PATH
fi


# MDR April 23, 2009: Added for virtualenvwrapper
if [ -x   /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/bin/virtualenvwrapper_bashrc ]; then
    export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs
    export PIP_VIRTUALENV_BASE=$WORKON_HOME
    source /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/bin/virtualenvwrapper_bashrc
fi
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Install easy_install, pip, virtualenv, and virtualenvwrapper for Python 2.6.2+</p>

<pre><code>curl -O http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py
sudo python ez_setup.py
sudo easy_install pip
sudo easy_install virtualenv
sudo easy_install virtualenvwrapper
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Create a virtualenv and then use pip to install PIL</p>

<pre><code>mkvirtualenv pil-test
cdvirtualenv
easy_install pip
pip install http://effbot.org/downloads/Imaging-1.1.6.tar.gz
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: I was not able to install PIL using <code>pip install pil</code>, so I installed from the URL as shown above.</p>

<h1>Original Answer</h1>

<p>From what I can see in your <a href="http://drop.io/gi2bgw6" rel="nofollow">pip-log.txt</a> file it appears that you installed Python 2.6.2 using the <a href="http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.6.2/python-2.6.2-macosx2009-04-16.dmg" rel="nofollow">Mac Installer Disk Image</a> from Python.org released on April 16, 2009. Can you confirm this?</p>

<p>From the pip log, gcc failed with exit status 1. The offending <code>gcc</code> command from your pip log is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>gcc -arch ppc -arch i386 -isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common -dynamic -DNDEBUG -g -O3 -DHAVE_LIBJPEG -DHAVE_LIBZ -I/System/Library/Frameworks/Tcl.framework/Headers -I/System/Library/Frameworks/Tk.framework/Headers -IlibImaging -I/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/include -I/usr/local/include -I/usr/include -I/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/include/python2.6 -c _imaging.c -o build/temp.macosx-10.3-fat-2.6/_imaging.o
</code></pre>

<p>This appears to be a problem related to Snow Leopard changing the default value for the -arch flag from <code>i386</code> to <code>x86-64</code> according to Ronald Oussoren in <a href="http://bugs.python.org/issue6802#msg92083" rel="nofollow">Message 92083</a> of <a href="http://bugs.python.org/issue6802" rel="nofollow">Python Issue 6802</a>. There is a patch available Python 2.6.2, but it has not been integrated into the Mac Installer Disk Image.</p>

<p>Your best solution that doesn't involve MacPorts or Fink would probably be to compile and install Python from the 2.6 release branch from either the <a href="http://code.python.org/hg/branches/release2.6-maint/" rel="nofollow">Mercurial Python Repository</a> or the <a href="http://svn.python.org/view/python/branches/release26-maint/" rel="nofollow">Subversion Python Repository</a>. According to <a href="http://bugs.python.org/issue6802#msg92315" rel="nofollow">Message 92315</a> of <a href="http://bugs.python.org/issue6802" rel="nofollow">Issue 6802</a>, Ronald Oussoren fixed this in <a href="http://svn.python.org/view?view=rev&amp;revision=74686" rel="nofollow">Revision r74686</a>. </p>

<p>I've been seeing similar errors using Python 2.6.2 installed from the Mac Disk Image while trying to then install Fabric in a virtualenv, so I plan to compile and install from the 2.6 release maintenance branch. If you want, I'll update when successful.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>10.6 Snow Leopard install PIL without the hassle and without keeping MacPorts :)<br>
<br>
Step 1: Install MacPorts<br>
Step 2: sudo port install py26-pil<br>
Step 3: mv /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/site-packages/* /Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/<br>
Step 4: Uninstall MacPorts<br>
<br>
Best of both worlds?</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>IT seems to me that the "No such file" is conjunction with stdarg.h is the most interesting error. There seems to be a header file missing. I don't know how to make sure it's installed on OS X, so this only half an answer, sorry about that, but maybe it pushes you in the right direction.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I found a simpler method.
sudo port install python26
sudo port install python_select</p>

<p>Then use python_select set python26 as default.</p>

<p>Then just install PIL as normal.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I was able to get PIP installed with SL's Python using these instructions:</p>

<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Do you have <a href="http://developer.apple.com/technology/xcode.html" rel="nofollow">XCode</a> (comes on the Snow Leopard disc) installed? There are some key components (most notably <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/" rel="nofollow">GCC</a>) that need to be installed which XCode handles for you.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>May be you should try pre-build universal binaries from pythonmac site</p>

<p><a href="http://pythonmac.org/packages/py25-fat/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://pythonmac.org/packages/py25-fat/index.html</a></p>

<p>These are for python2.5 , with python2.5 included(so may or may not be usable for you), I have been using it since I had problem using self build PIL with py2app.</p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>Following steps worked for me:</p>

<pre><code>$ brew install pip
$ export ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch x86_64"
$ pip install pil
</code></pre>
