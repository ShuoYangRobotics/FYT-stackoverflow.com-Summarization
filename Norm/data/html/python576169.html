<h3>Question (ID-576169):</h3><h2>Understanding Python super() and init methods</h2><p>Trying to understand super(). From the looks of it, both child classes can be created just fine. Im curious as to what difference there actually is in this code:</p>

<pre><code>class Base(object):
    def __init__(self):
        print "Base created"

class ChildA(Base):
    def __init__(self):
        Base.__init__(self)

class ChildB(Base):
    def __init__(self):
        super(ChildB, self).__init__()

print ChildA(),ChildB()
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-2):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Super lets you avoid referring to the base class explicitly, which can be nice. But the main advantage comes with multiple inheritance, where all sorts of <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=236275" rel="nofollow">fun stuff</a> can happen. See the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#super" rel="nofollow">standard docs on super</a> if you haven't already.</p>

<p>Edit: Note that the syntax changed in Python 3.0: you can just say <code>super().__init__()</code> instead of <code>super(ChildB, self).__init__()</code> which IMO is quite a bit nicer.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>There isn't, really. <code>super()</code> looks at the next class in the MRO (method resolution order, accessed with <code>cls.__mro__</code>) to call the methods. Just calling the base <code>__init__</code> calls the base <code>__init__</code>. As it happens, the MRO has exactly one item-- the base. So you're really doing the exact same thing, but in a nicer way with <code>super()</code> (particularly if you get into multiple inheritance later).</p>
