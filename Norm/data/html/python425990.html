The first is <a href="http://jdhardy.blogspot.com/2008/12/solving-zlib-problem-ironpythonzlib.html" rel="nofollow">Solving the zlib problem</a> which discusses the absence of zlib for IronPython; hence, no easyinstall. Jeff reimplemented zlib based on ComponentAce's zlib.net. And finally, in <a href="http://jdhardy.blogspot.com/2008/12/easyinstall-on-ironpython-part-deux.html" rel="nofollow">easy_install on IronPython, Part Deux</a> Jeff discusses some final tweaks that are needed before easy_install can be used with IronPython.</p>
