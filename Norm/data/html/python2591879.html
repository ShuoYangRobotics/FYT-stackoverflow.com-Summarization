<h3>Question (ID-2591879):</h3><h2>PyPy -- How can it possibly beat CPython?</h2><p>From the <a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2010/04/pypy-12-released.html" rel="nofollow">Google Open Source Blog</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PyPy is a reimplementation of Python
  in Python, using advanced techniques
  to try to attain better performance
  than CPython. Many years of hard work
  have finally paid off. Our speed
  results often beat CPython, ranging
  from being slightly slower, to
  speedups of up to 2x on real
  application code, to speedups of up to
  10x on small benchmarks.</p>

<p>How is this possible? Which Python implementation was used to implement PyPy? <a href="http://python.org" rel="nofollow">CPython</a>? And what are the chances of a PyPyPy or PyPyPyPy beating their score?</p>

<p>(On a related note... why would anyone try something like this?)</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-3):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p><strong>Q1. How is this possible?</strong></p>

<p>It is possible because the Python interpreter that is implemented by PyPy does not run on top of CPython (although it can) - first it is translated into another language (such as C) which can then be compiled and run independently (and often much faster) than CPython. Refer <a href="http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/translation.html" rel="nofollow">http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/translation.html</a> for details.</p>

<p>Manual memory management (which is what CPython does with it's counting) can be slower than automatic management in some cases. </p>

<p>Limitations in the implementation of the CPython interpreter preclude certain optimisations that PyPy can do (eg. fine grained locks).</p>

<p>As Marcelo mentioned, the JIT. Being able to on the fly confirm the type of an object can save you the need to do multiple pointer dereferences to finally arrive at the method you want to call. </p>

<p><strong>Q2. Which Python implementation was used to implement PyPy?</strong></p>

<p>The PyPy interpreter is implemented in RPython which is a statically typed subset of Python (the language and not the CPython interpreter). - Refer <a href="http://codespeak.net/pypy/trunk/pypy/doc/architecture.html" rel="nofollow">http://codespeak.net/pypy/trunk/pypy/doc/architecture.html</a> for details.</p>

<p><strong>Q3. And what are the chances of a PyPyPy or PyPyPyPy beating their score?</strong></p>

<p>That would depend on the implementation of these hypothetical interpreters. If one of them for example took the source, did some kind of analysis on it and converted it directly into tight target specific assembly code after running for a while, I imagine it would be quite faster than CPython. </p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Recently, on a <a href="http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2011/02/pypy-faster-than-c-on-carefully-crafted.html" rel="nofollow">carefully crafted example</a>, PyPy outperformed a similar C program compiled with <code>gcc -O3</code>. It's a contrived case but does exhibit some ideas.</p>

<p><strong>Q4. Why would anyone try something like this?</strong></p>

<p>From the official site. <a href="http://codespeak.net/pypy/trunk/pypy/doc/architecture.html#id7" rel="nofollow">http://codespeak.net/pypy/trunk/pypy/doc/architecture.html#id7</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We aim to provide:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>a common translation and support framework for producing implementations of dynamic languages, emphasising a clean separation between language specification and  implementation aspects.</li>
  <li>a compliant, flexible and fast implementation of the Python Language using the above framework to enable new advanced features without having to encode low level details into it.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>By separating concerns in this way, we
  intend for our implementation of
  Python - and other dynamic languages -
  to become robust against almost all
  implementation decisions, including
  target platform, memory and threading
  models, optimizations applied, up to
  to the point of being able to
  automatically generate Just-in-Time
  compilers for dynamic languages.</p>
  
  <p>Conversely, our implementation
  techniques, including the JIT compiler
  generator, should become robust
  against changes in the languages
  implemented.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>PyPy is implemented in Python, but it implements a JIT compiler to generate native code on the fly.</p>

<p>The reason to implement PyPy on top of Python is probably that it is simply a very productive language, especially since the JIT compiler makes the host language's performance somewhat irrelevant.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>PyPy is written in Restricted Python. It does not run on top of the CPython interpreter, as far as I know. Restricted Python is a subset of the Python language. AFAIK, the PyPy interpreter is compiled to machine code, so when installed it does not utilize a python interpreter at runtime.</p>

<p>Your question seems to expect the PyPy interpreter is running on top of CPython while executing code.
<strong>Edit:</strong> Yes, to use PyPy you first translate the PyPy python code, either to C and build with gcc, to jvm byte code, or to .Net CLI code. See <a href="http://codespeak.net/pypy/trunk/pypy/doc/getting-started-python.html" rel="nofollow">Getting Started</a></p>
