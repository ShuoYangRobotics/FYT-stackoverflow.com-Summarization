<h3>Question (ID-354883):</h3><h2>How do you return multiple values in Python?</h2><p>The canonical way to return multiple values in languages that support it is often <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38508/whats-the-best-way-to-return-multiple-values-from-a-function-in-python">tupling</a>. </p>

<p>Consider this trivial example:</p>

<pre><code>def f(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return (y0,y1,y2)
</code></pre>

<p>However, this quickly gets problematic as the number of values returned increases. What if you want to return four or five values? Sure, you could keep tupling them, but it gets easy to forget which value is where. It's also rather ugly to unpack them wherever you want to receive them.</p>

<p>The next logical step seems to be to introduce some sort of 'record notation'. In python, the obvious way to do this is by means of a <code>dict</code>. </p>

<p>Consider the following:</p>

<pre><code>def g(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return {'y0':y0, 'y1':y1 ,'y2':y2 }
</code></pre>

<p>(edit- Just to be clear, y0, y1 and y2 are just meant as abstract identifiers. As pointed out, in practice you'd use meaningful identifiers)</p>

<p>Now, we have a mechanism whereby we can project out a particular member of the returned object. For example, </p>

<pre><code>result['y0']
</code></pre>

<p>However, there is another option. We could instead return a specialized structure. I've framed this in the context of Python, but I'm sure it applies to other languages as well. Indeed, if you were working in C this might very well be your only option. Here goes:</p>

<pre><code>class ReturnValue(object):
  def __init__(y0, y1, y2):
     self.y0 = y0
     self.y1 = y1
     self.y2 = y2

def g(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return ReturnValue(y0, y1, y2)
</code></pre>

<p>In python the previous two are perhaps very similar in terms of plumbing- After all <code>{ y0, y1, y2 }</code> just end up being entries in the internal <code>__dict__</code> of the ResultValue.</p>

<p>There is one additional feature provided by Python though for tiny objects, the <code>__slots__</code> attribute. The class could be expressed as:</p>

<pre><code>class ReturnValue(object):
  __slots__ = ["y0", "y1", "y2"]
  def __init__(y0, y1, y2):
     self.y0 = y0
     self.y1 = y1
     self.y2 = y2
</code></pre>

<p>"The <code>__slots__</code> declaration takes a sequence of instance variables and reserves just enough space in each instance to hold a value for each variable. Space is saved because <code>__dict__</code> is not created for each instance." <a href="http://www.network-theory.co.uk/docs/pylang/__slots__.html" rel="nofollow">Python reference manual</a>.</p>

<p>Another suggestion which I'd overlooked comes from Bill the Lizard:
    def h(x):
      result = [x + 1]
      result.append(x * 3)
      result.append(y0 ** y3)
      return result</p>

<p>This is my least favorite method though. I suppose I'm tainted by exposure to Haskell, but the idea of mixed-type lists has always felt uncomfortable to me. In this particular example the list is -not- mixed type, but it conceivably could be. A list used in this way really doesn't gain anything with respect to the tuple as far as I can tell. The only real difference between lists and tuples in Python is that lists are <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-mutable" rel="nofollow">mutable</a>, wheras tuples are not. I personally tend to carry over the conventions from functional programming: use lists for any number of elements of the same type, and tuples for a fixed number of elements of predetermined types.</p>

<p>After the lengthy preamble, comes the inevitable question. Which method (do you think) is best?</p>

<p>I've typically found myself going the dictionary route because it involves less set-up work. From a types perspective however, you might be better off going the class route, since that may help you avoid confusing what a dictionary represents. On the other hand, there are some in<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I prefer to use tuples whenever a tuple feels "natural"; coordinates are a typical example, where the separate objects can stand on their own, e.g. in one-axis only scaling calculations.</p>

<p>I use dictionaries as a return value only when the grouped objects aren't always the same. Think optional email headers.</p>

<p>For the rest of the cases, where the grouped objects have inherent meaning inside the group or a fully-fledged object with its own methods is needed, I use a class.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>+1 on S.Lott's suggestion of a named container class.</p>

<p>For python 2.6 and up, a <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple" rel="nofollow">named tuple</a> provides a useful way of easily creating these container classes, and the results are "lightweight and require no more memory than regular tuples".</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><a href="http://docs.python.org/library/collections.html#namedtuple-factory-function-for-tuples-with-named-fields" rel="nofollow">Named tuples</a> were added in 2.6 for this purpose.  Also see <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/os.html#os.stat" rel="nofollow">os.stat</a> for a similar builtin example.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import collections
&gt;&gt;&gt; point = collections.namedtuple('Point', ['x', 'y'])
&gt;&gt;&gt; p = point(1, y=2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; p.x, p.y
(1, 2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; p[0], p[1]
(1, 2)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>For small projects I find it easiest to work with tuples. When that gets too hard to manage (and not before) I start grouping things into logical structures, however I think your suggested use of dictionaries and ReturnValue objects is wrong (or too simplistic).</p>

<p>Returning a dictionary with keys y0, y1, y2 etc doesn't offer any advantage over tuples. Returning a ReturnValue instance with properties .y0 .y1 .y2 etc doesn't offer any advantage over tuples either. You need to start naming things if you want to get anywhere, and you can do that using tuples anyway:</p>

<pre><code>def getImageData(filename):
  [snip]
  return size, (format, version, compression), (width,height)
size, type, dimensions = getImageData(x)
</code></pre>

<p>IMHO, the only good technique beyond tuples is to return real objects with proper methods and properties, like you get from <code>re.match()</code> or <code>open(file)</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Generally, the "specialized structure" actually IS a sensible current state of an object, with its own methods.</p>

<pre><code>class Some3SpaceThing(object):
  def __init__(self,x):
    self.g(x)
  def g(self,x):
    self.y0 = x + 1
    self.y1 = x * 3
    self.y2 = y0 ** y3

r = Some3SpaceThing( x )
r.y0
r.y1
r.y2
</code></pre>

<p>I like to find names for anonymous structures where possible.  Meaningful names make things more clear.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I prefer</p>

<pre><code>def g(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return {'y0':y0, 'y1':y1 ,'y2':y2 }
</code></pre>

<p>it seems everything else is just extra code to do the same thing.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>In languages like Python, I would usually use a dictionary as it involves less overhead than creating a new class.</p>

<p>However, if I find myself constantly returning the same set of variables, then that probably involves a new class that I'll factor out.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>I vote for the dictionary.</p>

<p>I find that if I make a function that returns anything more than 2-3 variables I'll fold them up in a dictionary.  Otherwise I tend to forget the order and content of what I'm returning.</p>

<p>Also, introducing a 'special' structure makes your code more difficult to follow. (Someone else will have to search through the code to find out what it is)</p>

<p>If your concerned about type look up, use descriptive dictionary keys, for example, 'x-values list'.</p>

<pre><code>def g(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return {'y0':y0, 'y1':y1 ,'y2':y2 }
</code></pre>
