<h3>Question (ID-1436703):</h3><h2>Difference between __str__ and __repr__ in Python</h2><p>What is the difference between <code>__str__</code> and <code>__repr__</code> in Python?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Alex summarized well but, surprisingly, was too succinct.</p>

<p>First, let me reiterate the main points in Alex’s post:</p>

<ul>
<li>The default implementation is useless (it’s hard to think of one which wouldn’t be, but yeah)</li>
<li><code>__repr__</code> goal is to be unambiguous</li>
<li><code>__str__</code> goal is to be readable</li>
<li>Container’s <code>__str__</code> uses contained objects’ <code>__repr__</code></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Default implementation is useless</strong></p>

<p>This is mostly a surprise because Python’s defaults tend to be fairly useful. However, in this case, having a default for <code>__repr__</code> which would act like:</p>

<pre><code>return “%s(%r)” % (self.__class__, self.__dict__)*
</code></pre>

<p>would have been too dangerous (for example, too easy to get into infinite recursion if objects reference each other). So Python cops out. Note that there is one default which is true: if <code>__repr__</code> is defined, and <code>__str__</code> is not, the object will behave as though <code>__str__=__repr__</code>.</p>

<p>This means, in simple terms: almost every object you implement should have a functional <code>__repr__</code> that’s usable for understanding the object. Implementing <code>__str__</code> is optional: do that if you need a “pretty print” functionality (for example, used by a report generator).</p>

<p><strong>The goal of <code>__repr__</code> is to be unambiguous</strong></p>

<p>Let me come right out and say it — I do not believe in debuggers. I don’t really know how to use any debugger, and have never used one seriously. Furthermore, I believe that the big fault in debuggers is their basic nature — most failures I debug happened a long long time ago, in a galaxy far far away. This means that I do believe, with religious fervor, in logging. Logging is the lifeblood of any decent fire-and-forget server system. Python makes it easy to log: with maybe some project specific wrappers, all you need is a</p>

<pre><code>log(INFO, “I am in the weird function and a is”, a, “and”, b, “is”, b, “but I got a null C — using default”, default_c)
</code></pre>

<p>But you have to do the last step — make sure every object you implement has a useful repr, so code like that can just work. This is why the “eval” thing comes up: if you have enough information so “<em>eval(repr(c))==c</em>”, that means you know everything there is to know about c. If that’s easy enough, at least in a fuzzy way, do it. If not, make sure you have enough information about c anyway. I usually use an eval-like format: “MyClass(this=%r,that=%r)” % (self.this,self.that). It does not mean that you can actually construct MyClass, or that those are the right constructor arguments — but it is a useful form to express “this is everything you need to know about this instance”.</p>

<p>Note: I used %r above, not %s. You always want to use repr() [or %r formatting character, equivalently] inside <strong>repr</strong> implementation, or you’re defeating the goal of repr. You want to be able to differentiate MyClass(3) and MyClass(“3″).</p>

<p><strong>The goal of <code>__str__</code> is to be readable</strong></p>

<p>Specifically, it is not intended to be unambiguous — notice that <code>str(3)==str(“3″)</code>. Likewise, if you implement an IP abstraction, having the str of it look like 192.168.1.1 is just fine. When implementing a date/time abstraction, the str can be “2010/4/12 15:35:22″, etc. The goal is to represent it in a way that a user, not a programmer, would want to read it. Chop off useless digits, pretend to be some other class — as long is it supports readability, it is an improvement.</p>

<p><strong>Container’s <code>__str__</code> uses contained objects’ <code>__repr__</code></strong></p>

<p>This seems surprising, doesn’t it? It is a little, but how readable would</p>

<pre><code>[moshe is, 3, hello
world, this is a list, oh I don't know, containing just 4 elements]
</code></pre>

<p>be? Not very. Specifically, the strings in a container would find it way too easy to disturb its string representation. In the face of ambiguity, remember, Python resists the temptation to guess. If you want the above behavior when you’re printing a list, just</p>

<pre><code>print “["+", ".join(l)+"]“
</code></pre>

<p>(you can probably also figure out what to do about dictionaries.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>Implement <code>__repr__</code> for any class you implement. This should be second nature. Implement <code>__str__</code> if you think it would be useful to have a string version which errs on the side of more readability in favor of more ambiguity.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><strong><code>__repr__</code></strong>: representation of python object usually eval will convert it back to that object</p>

<p><strong><code>__str_</code>_</strong>: is whatever you think is that object in text form</p>

<p>e.g.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s="""w'o"w"""
&gt;&gt;&gt; repr(s)
'\'w\\\'o"w\''
&gt;&gt;&gt; str(s)
'w\'o"w'
&gt;&gt;&gt; eval(str(s))==s
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  File "&lt;string&gt;", line 1
    w'o"w
       ^
SyntaxError: EOL while scanning single-quoted string
&gt;&gt;&gt; eval(repr(s))==s
True
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Unless you specifically act to ensure otherwise, most classes don't have helpful results for either:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class Sic(object): pass
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; print str(Sic())
&lt;__main__.Sic object at 0x8b7d0&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print repr(Sic())
&lt;__main__.Sic object at 0x8b7d0&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As you see -- no difference, and no info beyond the class and object's <code>id</code>.  If you only override one of the two...:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class Sic(object): 
...   def __repr__(object): return 'foo'
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; print str(Sic())
foo
&gt;&gt;&gt; print repr(Sic())
foo
&gt;&gt;&gt; class Sic(object):
...   def __str__(object): return 'foo'
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; print str(Sic())
foo
&gt;&gt;&gt; print repr(Sic())
&lt;__main__.Sic object at 0x2617f0&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>as you see, if you override <code>__repr__</code>, that's ALSO used for <code>__str__</code>, but not vice versa.</p>

<p>Other crucial tidbits to know: <code>__str__</code> on a built-on container uses the <code>__repr__</code>, NOT the <code>__str__</code>, for the items it contains. And, despite the words on the subject found in typical docs, hardly anybody bothers making the <code>__repr__</code> of objects be a string that <code>eval</code> may use to build an equal object (it's just too hard, AND not knowing how the relevant module was actually imported makes it actually flat out impossible).</p>

<p>So, my advice: focus on making <code>__str__</code> reasonably human-readable, and <code>__repr__</code> as unambiguous as you possibly can, even if that interferes with the fuzzy unattainable goal of making <code>__repr__</code>'s returned value acceptable as input to <code>__eval__</code>!</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>My rule of thumb:  <code>__repr__</code> is for developers, <code>__str__</code> is for customers.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>From <a href="http://pyref.infogami.com/%5F%5Fstr%5F%5F" rel="nofollow">http://pyref.infogami.com/%5F%5Fstr%5F%5F</a> by effbot:</p>

<p><code>__str__</code> "computes the "informal" string representation of an object. This differs from <code>__repr__</code> in that it does not have to be a valid Python expression: a more convenient or concise representation may be used instead."</p>
