<h3>Question (ID-1191374):</h3><h2>subprocess with timeout</h2><p>In Python, I have a program snippet similar to the following that has the effect of running a custom command and returning the stdout data (or raise exception when exit code is non-zero):</p>

<pre><code>proc = subprocess.Popen(
    cmd,
    # keep stderr separate; or merge it with stdout (default).
    stderr=(subprocess.PIPE if ignore_stderr else subprocess.STDOUT),
    stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
    shell=True)
</code></pre>

<p>And then I use <code>communicate</code> (not <code>wait</code> which could deadlock) to wait for the complete stdout data:</p>

<pre><code>stdoutdata, stderrdata = proc.communicate()
</code></pre>

<p>My question is - how do I set a timeout for any command? For example, I don't want the program to wait indefinitely because a particular programs takes more than, say, 5 minutes to run.</p>

<p>Simpler, unsophisticated solutions would be nice.</p>

<pre><code>import signal
  ...
class Alarm(Exception):
    pass

def alarm_handler(signum, frame):
    raise Alarm

signal.signal(signal.SIGALRM, alarm_handler)
signal.alarm(5*60)  # 5 minutes
try:
    stdoutdata, stderrdata = proc.communicate()
    signal.alarm(0)  # reset the alarm
except Alarm:
    print "Oops, taking too long!"
    # whatever else
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Here is Alex Martelli's solution as a module with proper process killing. The other approaches do not work because they do not use proc.communicate(). So if you have a process that produces lots of output, it will fill its output buffer and then block until you read something from it.</p>

<pre><code>from os import kill
from signal import alarm, signal, SIGALRM, SIGKILL
from subprocess import PIPE, Popen

def run(args, cwd = None, shell = False, kill_tree = True, timeout = -1, env = None):
    '''
    Run a command with a timeout after which it will be forcibly
    killed.
    '''
    class Alarm(Exception):
        pass
    def alarm_handler(signum, frame):
        raise Alarm
    p = Popen(args, shell = shell, cwd = cwd, stdout = PIPE, stderr = PIPE, env = env)
    if timeout != -1:
        signal(SIGALRM, alarm_handler)
        alarm(timeout)
    try:
        stdout, stderr = p.communicate()
        if timeout != -1:
            alarm(0)
    except Alarm:
        pids = [p.pid]
        if kill_tree:
            pids.extend(get_process_children(p.pid))
        for pid in pids:
            # process might have died before getting to this line
            # so wrap to avoid OSError: no such process
            try: 
                kill(pid, SIGKILL)
            except OSError:
                pass
        return -9, '', ''
    return p.returncode, stdout, stderr

def get_process_children(pid):
    p = Popen('ps --no-headers -o pid --ppid %d' % pid, shell = True,
              stdout = PIPE, stderr = PIPE)
    stdout, stderr = p.communicate()
    return [int(p) for p in stdout.split()]

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print run('find /', shell = True, timeout = 3)
    print run('find', shell = True)

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I don't know much about the low level details; but, given that in
python 2.6 the API offers the ability to wait for threads and
terminate processes, what about running the process in a separate
thread?</p>

<pre><code>import subprocess, threading

class Command(object):
    def __init__(self, cmd):
        self.cmd = cmd
        self.process = None

    def run(self, timeout):
        def target():
            print 'Thread started'
            self.process = subprocess.Popen(self.cmd, shell=True)
            self.process.communicate()
            print 'Thread finished'

        thread = threading.Thread(target=target)
        thread.start()

        thread.join(timeout)
        if thread.is_alive():
            print 'Terminating process'
            self.process.terminate()
            thread.join()
        print self.process.returncode

command = Command("echo 'Process started'; sleep 2; echo 'Process finished'")
command.run(timeout=3)
command.run(timeout=1)
</code></pre>

<p>The output of this snippet in my machine is:</p>

<pre><code>Thread started
Process started
Process finished
Thread finished
0
Thread started
Process started
Terminating process
Thread finished
-15
</code></pre>

<p>where it can be seen that, in the first execution, the process
finished correctly (return code 0), while the in the second one the
process was terminated (return code -15).</p>

<p>I haven't tested in windows; but, aside from updating the example
command, I think it should work since I haven't found in the
documentation anything that says that thread.join or process.terminate
is not supported.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>This is the best I could come up with (extracted from my private program):</p>

<pre><code>        # poll for terminated status till timeout is reached
        t_beginning = time.time()
        seconds_passed = 0
        while True:
            if p.poll() is not None:
                break
            seconds_passed = time.time() - t_beginning
            if timeout and seconds_passed &gt; timeout:
                p.terminate()
                raise TimeoutError(cmd, timeout)
            time.sleep(0.1)
</code></pre>

<p>(inspired by some other SO comment elsewhere)</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Another option is to write to a temporary file to prevent the stdout blocking instead of needing to poll with communicate(). This worked for me where the other answers did not; for example on windows.</p>

<pre><code>    outFile =  tempfile.SpooledTemporaryFile() 
    errFile =   tempfile.SpooledTemporaryFile() 
    proc = subprocess.Popen(args, stderr=errFile, stdout=outFile, universal_newlines=False)
    wait_remaining_sec = timeout

    while proc.poll() is None and wait_remaining_sec &gt; 0:
        time.sleep(1)
        wait_remaining_sec -= 1

    if wait_remaining_sec &lt;= 0:
        killProc(proc.pid)
        raise ProcessIncompleteError(proc, timeout)

    # read temp streams from start
    outFile.seek(0);
    errFile.seek(0);
    out = outFile.read()
    err = errFile.read()
    outFile.close()
    errFile.close()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I've used <a href="http://benjamin.smedbergs.us/blog/2006-12-11/killableprocesspy/" rel="nofollow">killableprocess</a> successfully on Windows, Linux and Mac. If you are using Cygwin Python, you'll need <a href="http://svn.osafoundation.org/chandler/trunk/chandler/tools/killableprocess.py" rel="nofollow">OSAF's version of killableprocess</a> because otherwise native Windows processes won't get killed.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I've implemented what I could gather from a few of these. This works in Windows, and since this is a community wiki, I figure I would share my code as well:</p>

<pre><code>class Command(threading.Thread):
    def __init__(self, cmd, outFile, errFile, timeout):
        threading.Thread.__init__(self)
        self.cmd = cmd
        self.process = None
        self.outFile = outFile
        self.errFile = errFile
        self.timed_out = False
        self.timeout = timeout

    def run(self):
        self.process = subprocess.Popen(self.cmd, stdout = self.outFile, \
            stderr = self.errFile)

        while (self.process.poll() is None and self.timeout &gt; 0):
            time.sleep(1)
            self.timeout -= 1

        if not self.timeout &gt; 0:
            self.process.terminate()
            self.timed_out = True
        else:
            self.timed_out = False
</code></pre>

<p>Then from another class or file:</p>

<pre><code>        outFile =  tempfile.SpooledTemporaryFile()
        errFile =   tempfile.SpooledTemporaryFile()

        executor = command.Command(c, outFile, errFile, timeout)
        executor.daemon = True
        executor.start()

        executor.join()
        if executor.timed_out:
            out = 'timed out'
        else:
            outFile.seek(0)
            errFile.seek(0)
            out = outFile.read()
            err = errFile.read()

        outFile.close()
        errFile.close()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Although I haven't looked at it extensively, this <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/307871-timing-out-function/" rel="nofollow">decorator</a> I found at ActiveState seems to be quite useful for this sort of thing. Along with <code>subprocess.Popen(..., close_fds=True)</code>, at least I'm ready for shell-scripting in Python.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>I added the solution with threading from jcollado to my project.</p>

<p>Install:</p>

<pre><code>easy_install easyprocess
</code></pre>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>from easyprocess import Proc

# shell is not supported!
stdout=Proc('ping localhost').call(timeout=1.5).stdout
print stdout
</code></pre>
