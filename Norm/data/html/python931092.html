<h3>Question (ID-931092):</h3><h2>Reverse a string in Python</h2><p>There is no built in "reverse" function in Python's str object.
What is the best way of implementing this?</p>

<p>If supplying a very concise answer, please elaborate on it's
efficiency.  Is the str converted to a different object, etc. </p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 'hello world'[::-1]
'dlrow olleh'
</code></pre>

<p>This is <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.3.5/whatsnew/section-slices.html" rel="nofollow">extended slice</a> syntax. It works by doing <code>[begin:end:step]</code> - by leaving begin and end off and specifying a step of -1, it reverses a string.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>@Paolo's <code>s[::-1]</code> is fastest; a slower approach (maybe more readable, but that's debatable) approach is <code>''.join(reversed(s))</code>.</p>
