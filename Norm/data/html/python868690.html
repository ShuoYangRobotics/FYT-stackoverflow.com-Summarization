<h3>Question (ID-868690):</h3><h2>Good examples of python-memcache (memcached) being used in Python?</h2><p>I'm writing a web app using Python and the web.py framework, and I need to use memcached throughout.</p>

<p>I've been searching the internet trying to find some good documentation on the <a href="http://www.tummy.com/Community/software/python-memcached/" rel="nofollow">python-memcached</a> module, but all I could find was <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/ha-memcached-interfaces-python.html" rel="nofollow">this example on the MySQL website</a>, and the documentation on its methods isn't great.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-1):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>It's fairly simple. You write values using keys and expiry times. You get values using keys. You can expire keys from the system.</p>

<p>Most clients follow the same rules. You can read the generic instructions and best practices on <a href="http://www.danga.com/memcached/" rel="nofollow">the memcached homepage</a>.</p>

<p>If you really want to dig into it, I'd look at the source. Here's the header comment:</p>

<pre><code>"""
client module for memcached (memory cache daemon)

Overview
========

See U{the MemCached homepage&lt;http://www.danga.com/memcached&gt;} for more about memcached.

Usage summary
=============

This should give you a feel for how this module operates::

    import memcache
    mc = memcache.Client(['127.0.0.1:11211'], debug=0)

    mc.set("some_key", "Some value")
    value = mc.get("some_key")

    mc.set("another_key", 3)
    mc.delete("another_key")

    mc.set("key", "1")   # note that the key used for incr/decr must be a string.
    mc.incr("key")
    mc.decr("key")

The standard way to use memcache with a database is like this::

    key = derive_key(obj)
    obj = mc.get(key)
    if not obj:
        obj = backend_api.get(...)
        mc.set(key, obj)

    # we now have obj, and future passes through this code
    # will use the object from the cache.

Detailed Documentation
======================

More detailed documentation is available in the L{Client} class.
