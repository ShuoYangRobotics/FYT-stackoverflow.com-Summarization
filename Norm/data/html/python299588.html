<h3>Question (ID-299588):</h3><h2>Validating with an XML schema in Python</h2><blockquote>
  <p><strong>Bounty</strong>: This is a 2 year old question. Is there a XSD validator for Python <strong>now</strong>?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have an XML file and an XML schema in another file and I'd like to validate that my XML file adheres to the schema.  How do I do this in Python?</p>

<p>I'd prefer something using the standard library, but I can install a third-party package if necessary.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-5):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I am assuming you mean using XSD files. Surprisingly there aren't many python XML libraries that support this. lxml does however. Check <a href="http://codespeak.net/lxml/validation.html#xmlschema" rel="nofollow">Validation with lxml</a>. The page also lists how to use lxml to validate with other schema types.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The PyXB package at <a href="http://pyxb.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">http://pyxb.sourceforge.net/</a> generates validating bindings for Python from XML schema documents.  It handles almost every schema construct and supports multiple namespaces.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>As for "pure python" solutions: the package index lists:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyxsd" rel="nofollow">pyxsd</a>, the description says it uses xml.etree.cElementTree, which is not "pure python" (but included in stdlib), but source code indicates that it falls back to xml.etree.ElementTree, so this would count as pure python. Haven't used it, but according to the docs, it does do schema validation.</li>
<li><a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/minixsv" rel="nofollow">minixsv</a>: 'a lightweight XML schema validator written in "pure" Python'. However, the description says "currently a subset of the XML schema standard is supported", so this may not be enough.</li>
<li><a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/XSV" rel="nofollow">XSV</a>, which I think is used for the W3C's online xsd validator (it still seems to use the old pyxml package, which I think is no longer maintained)</li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>lxml provides etree.DTD</p>

<p>from the tests on <a href="http://codespeak.net/lxml/api/lxml.tests.test_dtd-pysrc.html" rel="nofollow">http://codespeak.net/lxml/api/lxml.tests.test_dtd-pysrc.html</a></p>

<pre><code>...
root = etree.XML(_bytes("&lt;b/&gt;")) 
dtd = etree.DTD(BytesIO("&lt;!ELEMENT b EMPTY&gt;")) 
self.assert_(dtd.validate(root))
</code></pre>
