<h3>Question (ID-1319615):</h3><h2>Proper way to declare custom exceptions in modern Python?</h2><p>What's the proper way to declare custom exception classes in modern Python? My primary goal is to follow whatever standard other exception classes have, so that (for instance) any extra string I include in the exception is printed out by whatever tool caught the exception.</p>

<p>By "modern Python" I mean something that will run in Python 2.5 but be 'correct' for the Python 2.6 and Python 3.* way of doing things. And by "custom" I mean an Exception object that can include extra data about the cause of the error: a string, maybe also some other arbitrary object relevant to the exception.</p>

<p>I was tripped up by the following deprecation warning in Python 2.6.2:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class MyError(Exception):
...     def __init__(self, message):
...     	self.message = message
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; MyError("foo")
_sandbox.py:3: DeprecationWarning: BaseException.message has been deprecated as of Python 2.6
</code></pre>

<p>It seems crazy that BaseException has a special meaning for attributes named "message". I gather from <A href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0352/" rel="nofollow">PEP-352</a> that attribute did have a special meaning in 2.5 they're trying to deprecate away, so I guess that name (and that one alone) is now forbidden? Ugh.</p>

<p>I'm also fuzzily aware that Exception has some magic parameter "args", but I've never known how to use it. Nor am I sure it's the right way to do things going forward; a lot of the discussion I found online suggested they were trying to do away with args in Python 3.</p>

<p>Update: two answers have suggested overriding __init__, and __str__/__unicode__/__repr__. That seems like a lot of typing, is it necessary?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-3):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Maybe I missed the question, but why not:</p>

<pre><code>class MyException(Exception):
    pass
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> to override somethign (or pass extra args), do this:</p>

<pre><code>class ValidationError(Exception):
    def __init__(self, message, Errors):

        # Call the base class constructor with the parameters it needs
        Exception.__init__(self, message)

        # Now for your custom code...
        self.Errors = Errors
</code></pre>

<p>That way you could pass dict of error messages to the second param, and get to it later with <code>e.Errors</code></p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You should override <code>__repr__</code> or <code>__unicode__</code> methods instead of using message, the args you provide when you construct the exception will be in <code>args</code> member variable when you need.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>No, "message" is not forbidden. It's just deprecated. You application will work fine with using message. But you may want to get rid of the deprecation error, of course.</p>

<p>When you create custom Exception classes for your application, many of them do not subclass just from Exception, but from others, like ValueError or similar. Then you have to adapt to their usage of variables.</p>

<p>And if you have many exceptions in your application it's usually a good idea to have a common custom base class for all of them, so that users of your modules can do</p>

<pre><code>try:
    ...
except NelsonsExceptions:
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>And in that case you can do the <code>__init__ and __str__</code> needed there, so you don't have to repeat it for every exception. But simply calling the message variable something else than message does the trick.</p>

<p>In any case, you only need the <code>__init__ or __str__</code> if you do something different from what Exception itself does. And because if the deprecation, you then need both, or you get an error. That's not a whole lot of extra code you need per class. ;)</p>
