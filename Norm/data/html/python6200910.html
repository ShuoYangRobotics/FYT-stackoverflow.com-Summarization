<h3>Question (ID-6200910):</h3><h2>Relationship between scipy and numpy</h2><p><code>scipy</code> appears to provide most (but not all [1]) of <code>numpy</code>'s functions in its own namespace. In other words, if there's a function named <code>numpy.foo</code>, there's almost certainly a <code>scipy.foo</code>. Most of the time, the two appear to be exactly the same, oftentimes even pointing to the same function object.</p>

<p>Sometimes, they're different. To give an example that came up recently:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>numpy.log10</code> is a ufunc that returns NaNs for negative arguments;</li>
<li><code>scipy.log10</code> returns complex values for negative arguments, and doesn't appear to be a ufunc.</li>
</ul>

<p>The same can be said about <code>log</code>, <code>log2</code> and <code>logn</code>, but not about <code>log1p</code> [2].</p>

<p>On the other hand, <code>numpy.exp</code> and <code>scipy.exp</code> appear to be different names for the same ufunc. This is also true of <code>scipy.log1p</code> and <code>numpy.log1p</code>.</p>

<p>Another example is <code>numpy.linalg.solve</code> vs <code>scipy.linalg.solve</code>. They're similar, but the latter offers some additional features over the former.</p>

<p>Why the apparent duplication? If this is meant to be a wholesale import of <code>numpy</code> into the <code>scipy</code> namespace, why the subtle differences in behaviour and the missing functions? Is there some overarching logic that would help clear up the confusion?</p>

<p>[1] <code>numpy.min</code>, <code>numpy.max</code>, <code>numpy.abs</code> and a few others have no counterparts in the <code>scipy</code> namespace.</p>

<p>[2] Tested using <code>numpy</code> 1.5.1 and <code>scipy</code> 0.9.0rc2.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-5):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Last time I checked it, the scipy <code>__init__</code> method executes a</p>

<pre><code>from numpy import *
</code></pre>

<p>so that the whole numpy namespace is included into scipy when the scipy module is imported.</p>

<p>The log10 behaviour you are describing is interesting, because <em>both</em> versions are coming from numpy. One is a <code>ufunc</code>, the other is a <code>numpy.lib</code> function. Why scipy is preferring the library function over the <code>ufunc</code>, I don't know off the top of my head.</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT: In fact, I can answer the log10 question. Looking in the scipy <code>__init__</code> method I see this:</p>

<pre><code># Import numpy symbols to scipy name space
import numpy as _num
from numpy import oldnumeric
from numpy import *
from numpy.random import rand, randn
from numpy.fft import fft, ifft
from numpy.lib.scimath import *
</code></pre>

<p>The log10 function you get in scipy comes from numpy.lib.scimath. Looking at that code, it says:</p>

<pre><code>"""
Wrapper functions to more user-friendly calling of certain math functions
whose output data-type is different than the input data-type in certain
domains of the input.

For example, for functions like log() with branch cuts, the versions in this
module provide the mathematically valid answers in the complex plane:

&gt;&gt;&gt; import math
&gt;&gt;&gt; from numpy.lib import scimath
&gt;&gt;&gt; scimath.log(-math.exp(1)) == (1+1j*math.pi)
True

Similarly, sqrt(), other base logarithms, power() and trig functions are
correctly handled.  See their respective docstrings for specific examples.
"""
</code></pre>

<p>It seems that module overlays the base numpy ufuncs for sqrt, log, log2, logn, log10, power, arccos, arcsin, and arctanh. That explains the behaviour you are seeing. The underlying design reason why it is done like that is probably buried in a mailing list post somewhere.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>From the SciPy Reference Guide:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... all of the Numpy functions have
  been subsumed into the <code>scipy</code>
  namespace so that all of those
  functions are available without
  additionally importing Numpy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The intention is for users not to have to know the distinction between the <code>scipy</code> and <code>numpy</code> namespaces, though apparently you've found an exception. </p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>There is a short comment at the end of the <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/general.html" rel="nofollow">introduction to SciPy</a> documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Another useful command is<code>source</code>. When given a function written in Python as an argument, it  prints out a listing of the source code for that function. This can be helpful in learning  about an algorithm or understanding exactly what a function is 
  doing with its arguments. Also donâ€™t forget about the Python command dir which can be 
  used to look at the namespace of a module or package.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this will allow someone with enough knowledge of all the packages involved to pick apart exactly what the differences are between <em>some</em> scipy and numpy functions (it didn't help me with the log10 question at all). I definitely don't have that knowledge but <code>source</code> does indicate that <code>scipy.linalg.solve</code> and <code>numpy.linalg.solve</code> interact with lapack in different ways;</p>

<p><code>scipy</code> depends on <code>numpy</code> and imports many <code>numpy</code> functions into its namespace for convenience.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Regarding the linalg package - the scipy functions will call lapack and blas, which are available in highly optimised versions on many platforms and offer very good performance, particularly for operations on reasonably large dense matrices.  On the other hand, they are not easy libraries to compile, requiring a fortran compiler and many platform specific tweaks to get full performance. Therefore, numpy provides simple implementations of many common linear algebra functions which are often good enough for many purposes.</p>
