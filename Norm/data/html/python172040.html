<h3>Question (ID-172040):</h3><h2>How do you develop against OpenID locally</h2><p>I'm developing a website (in Django) that uses OpenID to authenticate users. As I'm currently only running on my local machine I can't authenticate using one of the OpenID providers on the web. So I figure I need to run a local OpenID server that simply lets me type in a username and then passes that back to my main app.</p>

<p>Does such an OpenID dev server exist? Is this the best way to go about it?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The libraries at <a href="http://openidenabled.com/" rel="nofollow">OpenID Enabled</a> ship with examples that are sufficient to run a local test provider.  Look in the examples/djopenid/ directory of the python-openid source distribution.  Running that will give you an instance of <a href="http://openidenabled.com/python-openid/trunk/examples/server/" rel="nofollow">this test provider</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I have no problems testing with <a href="http://myopenid.com" rel="nofollow">myopenid.com</a>. I thought there would be a problem testing on my local machine but it just worked. (I'm using ASP.NET with DotNetOpenId library).</p>

<p>The 'realm' and return url must contain the port number like '<a href="http://localhost:93359" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:93359</a>'.</p>

<p>I assume it works OK because the provider does a client side redirect.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I'm also looking into this.  I too am working on a Django project that might utilize Open Id.  For references, check out:</p>

<p>Hopefully someone here has tackled this issue.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I'm using <a href="http://siege.org/projects/phpMyID/" rel="nofollow">phpMyID</a> to authenticate at StackOverflow right now. Generates a standard HTTP auth realm and works perfectly. It should be exactly what you need.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You could probably use the django OpenID library to write a provider to test against. Have one that always authenticates and one that always fails.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Why not run an OpenID provider from your local machine?</p>

<p>If you are a .Net developer there is an OpenID provider library for .Net at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/dotnetopenid/" rel="nofollow">Google Code</a>. This uses the standard .Net profile provider mechanism and wraps it with an OpenID layer. We are using it to add OpenID to our custom authentication engine.</p>

<p>If you are working in another language/platform there are a number of OpenID implementation avalaiable from the OpenID community site <a href="http://wiki.openid.net/Libraries" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>You shouldn't be having trouble developing against your own machine. What error are you getting?</p>

<p>An OpenID provider will ask you to give your site (in this case <a href="http://localhost:8000" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8000</a> or similar) access to your identity. If you click ok then it will redirect you that url. I've never had problems with <a href="http://www.livejournal.com" rel="nofollow">livejournal</a> and I expect that <a href="http://myopenid.com" rel="nofollow">myopenid.com</a> will work too.</p>

<p>If you're having problems developing locally I suggest that the problem you're having is unrelated to the url being localhost, but something else. Without an error message or problem description it's impossible to say more.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: It turns out that Yahoo do things differently to other OpenID providers that I've come across and disallow redirections to ip address, sites without a correct tld in their domain name and those that run on ports other than 80 or 443. See <a href="http://openid.net/pipermail/general/2008-January/004024.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> for a post from a Yahoo developer on this subject. <a href="http://openid.net/pipermail/general/2008-January/004023.html" rel="nofollow">This post</a> offers a work around, but I would suggest that for development myopenid.com would be far simpler than working around Yahoo, or running your own provider.</p>
