<h3>Question (ID-1015581):</h3><h2>Continuous unit testing with Pydev (Python and Eclipse)</h2><p>Is there a way to integrate background unit tests with the Pydev Eclipse environment?</p>

<p>My unit tests run well, but I would like to integrate them to run in the background based on source file changes (e.g. with nose) and to integrate the result back to Eclipse (I'm thinking big red X when tests fail with a console and trace log view).</p>

<p>No, a command prompt running nose on the side does not count.</p>

<p>I have had this Eclipse integration when developing RoR stuff.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Tal.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Check out the new Pydev (1.6.4) <a href="http://pydev.org/manual_adv_pyunit.html" rel="nofollow">http://pydev.org/manual_adv_pyunit.html</a></p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>This feature has been added to PyDev 2.0.1 with an option to relaunch the tests in the last test run whenever a python file change, with an additional option to rerun only the errors -- although it'll run the full test suite if no errors were found, as the idea is that you work through your errors and when all pass a final launch for the whole suite is done (then you can move on to another task).</p>

<p>The current nightly build has this feature incorporated.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Pydev does have some unit-test integration, but that's only as a run configuration...so...</p>

<p>This is not a very elegant way, but if you:</p>

<ol>
<li>Enable Project->Build Automatically</li>
<li>In your project properties, add a new builder of type Program</li>
<li>Configure it to run your tests and select 'during auto builds'</li>
</ol>

<p>Then at least you will get something that outputs the test results to the console on resource saves.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I just realized that PyDev has rather powerful scripting support. Unfortunately I don't have the time to do it all for you (but if you complete this, please post it here :)</p>

<p>If you create a file named <code>pyedit_nose.py</code> that looks like this in an otherwise empty folder :</p>

<pre><code>assert cmd is not None
assert editor is not None

if cmd == 'onSave':
    from java.lang import Runtime
    from java.io import BufferedReader
    from java.io import InputStreamReader

    from org.eclipse.core.resources import ResourcesPlugin
    from org.eclipse.core.resources import IMarker
    from org.eclipse.core.resources import IResource

    proc = Runtime.getRuntime().exec('ls -al')
    extra_message = BufferedReader(InputStreamReader(proc.inputStream)).readLine()

    r = ResourcesPlugin.getWorkspace().getRoot()
    for marker in r.findMarkers(IMarker.PROBLEM, False, IResource.DEPTH_INFINITE):
        if marker.getAttribute(IMarker.MESSAGE).startsWith("Some test failed!"):
            marker.delete()

    for rr in r.getProjects():
        marker = rr.createMarker(IMarker.PROBLEM)
        marker.setAttribute(IMarker.MESSAGE, "Some test failed! " + extra_message)
        marker.setAttribute(IMarker.PRIORITY, IMarker.PRIORITY_HIGH)
        marker.setAttribute(IMarker.SEVERITY, IMarker.SEVERITY_ERROR)
</code></pre>

<p>and set up Preferences->PyDev->Scripting Pydev to point to this directory you will get all projects in your workspace marked with an error every time a file is saved.</p>

<p>By executing a script that returns the test results in some easy to parse format rather than <code>ls</code> and parsing the output you should be able to put your markers in the right places.</p>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I am using <a href="http://jeffwinkler.net/2006/04/27/keeping-your-nose-green/" rel="nofollow">Nosy</a> which is handy.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I enhanced the "nosy" script to automatically build documentation and runs tests 
continuously. Nothing stellar, but gets the job done. Posting it here because the original
link went down. Unlike the original nosy script, this one scans the directory recursively
and allows looking for multiple patterns.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I run the test by hand the first time (<em>Run > Run As > Python unit test</em>). After that, I use
<code>Ctrl+Shift+F9</code> to have the files saved and the tests executed, instead of saving with <code>Ctrl+S</code> and expecting some magic to happen. </p>

<p>The <code>Ctrl+Shift+F9</code> key combination relaunches the last run configuration.</p>
