<h3>Question (ID-473620):</h3><h2>How do you create a daemon in Python?</h2><p><a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=python+daemon" rel="nofollow">Searching on Google</a> reveals x2 code snippets. The first result is to <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/278731/" rel="nofollow">this code recipe</a> which has a lot of documentation and explanation, along with some useful discussion underneath. </p>

<p>However, <a href="http://www.jejik.com/articles/2007/02/a_simple_unix_linux_daemon_in_python/" rel="nofollow">another code sample</a>, whilst not containing so much documentation, includes sample code for passing commands such as start, stop and restart. It also creates a PID file which can be handy for checking if the daemon is already running etc.</p>

<p>These samples both explain how to create the daemon. Are there any additional things that need to be considered? Is one sample better than the other, and why?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-5):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>There are <strong>many fiddly things</strong> to take care of when becoming a <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3143/#correct-daemon-behaviour" rel="nofollow">well-behaved daemon process</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>prevent core dumps (many daemons run as root, and core dumps can contain sensitive information)</p></li>
<li><p>behave correctly inside a <code>chroot</code> gaol</p></li>
<li><p>set UID, GID, working directory, umask, and other process parameters appropriately for the use case</p></li>
<li><p>relinquish elevated <code>suid</code>, <code>sgid</code> privileges</p></li>
<li><p>close all open file descriptors, with exclusions depending on the use case</p></li>
<li><p>behave correctly if started inside an already-detached context, such as <code>init</code>, <code>inetd</code>, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>set up signal handlers for sensible daemon behaviour, but also with specific handlers determined by the use case</p></li>
<li><p>redirect the standard streams <code>stdin</code>, <code>stdout</code>, <code>stderr</code> since a daemon process no longer has a controlling terminal</p></li>
<li><p>handle a PID file as a cooperative advisory lock, which is a whole can of worms in itself with many contradictory but valid ways to behave</p></li>
<li><p>allow proper cleanup when the process is terminated</p></li>
<li><p>actually become a daemon process without leading to zombies</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Some of these are <strong>standard</strong>, as described in canonical Unix literature (<em>Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment</em>, by the late W. Richard Stevens, Addison-Wesley, 1992). Others, such as stream redirection and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/688343/reference-for-proper-handling-of-pid-file-on-unix">PID file handling</a>, are <strong>conventional behaviour</strong> most daemon users would expect but that are less standardised.</p>

<p>All of these are covered by the <strong><a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3143" rel="nofollow">PEP 3143</a> “Standard daemon process library” specification</strong> and the <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-daemon/" rel="nofollow">python-daemon</a> reference implementation.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Sander Marechal's <a href="http://www.jejik.com/articles/2007/02/a_simple_unix_linux_daemon_in_python/" rel="nofollow">code sample</a> is superior to the original, which was originally posted in 2004.  I once contributed a daemonizer for Pyro, but would probably use Sander's code if I had to do it over.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Note the <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-daemon/" rel="nofollow">python-daemon</a> package which solves a lot of problems behind daemons out of the box.</p>

<p>Among other features it enables to (from Debian package description):</p>

<ul>
<li>Detach the process into its own process group.</li>
<li>Set process environment appropriate for running inside a chroot.</li>
<li>Renounce suid and sgid privileges.</li>
<li>Close all open file descriptors.</li>
<li>Change the working directory, uid, gid, and umask.</li>
<li>Set appropriate signal handlers.</li>
<li>Open new file descriptors for stdin, stdout, and stderr.</li>
<li>Manage a specified PID lock file.</li>
<li>Register cleanup functions for at-exit processing.</li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The easiest way to create daemon with Python is to use the <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/" rel="nofollow">Twisted</a> event-driven framework.  It handles all of the stuff necessary for daemonization for you.  It uses the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactor_pattern" rel="nofollow">Reactor Pattern</a> to handle concurrent requests.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>80% of the time, when folks say "daemon", they only want a server.  Since the question is perfectly unclear on this point, it's hard to say what the possible domain of answers could be.  Since a server is adequate, start there.  If an actual "daemon" is actually needed (this is rare), read up on <code>nohup</code> as a way to daemonize a server.</p>

<p>Until such time as an actual daemon is actually required, just write a simple server.</p>

<p>Also look at the <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/lib/module-wsgiref.html" rel="nofollow">WSGI reference</a> implementation.</p>

<p>Also look at the <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/lib/module-SimpleHTTPServer.html" rel="nofollow">Simple HTTP Server</a>.</p>

<p>"Are there any additional things that need to be considered? "  Yes.  About a million things.  What protocol?  How many requests?  How long to service each request?  How frequently will they arrive?  Will you use a dedicated process?  Threads?  Subprocesses?  Writing a daemon is a big job.  </p>
