<h3>Question (ID-39086):</h3><h2>Search and replace a line in a file in Python</h2><p>I want to loop over the contents of a text file and do a search and replace on some lines and write the result back to the file. I could first load the whole file in memory and then write it back, but that probably is not the best way to do it.</p>

<p>What is the best way to do this, within the following code?</p>

<pre><code>f = open(file)
for line in f:
    if line.contains('foo'):
        newline = line.replace('foo', 'bar')
        # how to write this newline back to the file
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Use the <code>fileinput</code> module. For example, the following adds line numbers to a file, in-place:</p>

<pre><code>import fileinput

for line in fileinput.input("test.txt", inplace=1):
    print "%d: %s" % (fileinput.filelineno(), line),
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I guess something like this should do it. It basically writes the content to a new file and replaces the old file with the new file:</p>

<pre><code>from tempfile import mkstemp
from shutil import move
from os import remove, close

def replace(file, pattern, subst):
    #Create temp file
    fh, abs_path = mkstemp()
    new_file = open(abs_path,'w')
    old_file = open(file)
    for line in old_file:
        new_file.write(line.replace(pattern, subst))
    #close temp file
    new_file.close()
    close(fh)
    old_file.close()
    #Remove original file
    remove(file)
    #Move new file
    move(abs_path, file)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Here's another example that was tested, and will match search &amp; replace patterns:</p>

<pre><code>import fileinput
import sys

def replaceAll(file,searchExp,replaceExp):
    for line in fileinput.input(file, inplace=1):
        if searchExp in line:
            line = line.replace(searchExp,replaceExp)
        sys.stdout.write(line)
</code></pre>

<p>Example use:</p>

<pre><code>replaceAll("/fooBar.txt","Hello\sWorld!$","Goodbye\sWorld.")
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>This should work: (inplace editiing)</p>

<pre><code>import fileinput

for line in fileinput(files, inplace = 1): # Does a list of files, and writes redirects STDOUT to the file in question
      print line.replace("foo", "bar")
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>As lassevk suggests, write out the new file as you go, here is some example code:</p>

<pre><code>fin = open("a.txt")
fout = open("b.txt", "wt")
for line in fin:
    fout.write( line.replace('foo', 'bar') )
fin.close()
fout.close()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Create a new file, copy lines from the old to the new, and do the replacing before you write the lines to the new file.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>@chutsu @jml: Eli is correct. When using fileinput with inplace=True, stout is redirected to the file. So, in his for loop, the output from the print statements is being sent to the file.</p>

<p>What's really happening is that a backup of the original file is made, and then stdout is redirected to a new file with the same name as the original file. The result is an "in place" edit.</p>
