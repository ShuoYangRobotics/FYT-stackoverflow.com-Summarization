<h3>Question (ID-1231688):</h3><h2>How do I remove packages installed with Python's easy_install?</h2><p>Python's <code>easy_install</code> makes installing new packages extremely convenient. However, as far as I can tell, it doesn't implement the other common features of a dependency manager - listing and removing installed packages.</p>

<p>What is the best way of finding out what's installed, and what is the preferred way of removing installed packages? Are there any files that need to be updated if I remove packages manually (e.g. by <code>rm /usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/my_installed_pkg.egg</code> or similar)?</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>To uninstall an <code>.egg</code> you need to <code>rm -rf</code> the egg (it might be a directory) and remove the matching line from <code>site-packages/easy-install.pth</code></p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>There are <a href="http://thingsilearned.com/2009/04/13/easy_install-uninstalling/" rel="nofollow">several</a> sources on the net suggesting a hack by reinstalling the package with the -m option and then just removing the .egg file in lib/ and the binaries in bin/. Also, discussion about this setuptools issue can be found on the python bug tracker as setuptools <a href="http://bugs.python.org/setuptools/issue21" rel="nofollow">issue 21</a>.</p>

<p>Edit: Added the link to the python bugtracker.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>If the problem is a serious-enough annoyance to you, you might consider <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv" rel="nofollow">virtualenv</a>. It allows you to create an environment that encapsulates python libraries. You install packages there rather than in the global site-packages directory. Any scripts you run in that environment have access to those packages (and optionally, your global ones as well). I use this a lot when evaluating packages that I am not sure I want/need to install globally. If you decide you don't need the package, it's easy enough to just blow that virtual environment away. It's pretty easy to use. Make a new env:</p>

<pre><code>$&gt;virtualenv /path/to/your/new/ENV
</code></pre>

<p>virtual_envt installs setuptools for you in the new environment, so you can do:</p>

<pre><code>$&gt;ENV/bin/easy_install
</code></pre>

<p>You can even create your own boostrap scripts that setup your new environment. So, with one command, you can create a new virtual env with, say, python 2.6, psycopg2 and django installed by default (you can can install an env-specific version of python if you want).</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>try</p>

<pre><code>$ easy_install -m [PACKAGE]
</code></pre>

<p>then</p>

<pre><code>$ rm -rf .../python2.X/site-packages/[PACKAGE].egg
</code></pre>

<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>First you have to run this command:</p>

<pre><code>$ easy_install -m [PACKAGE]
</code></pre>

<p>It removes all dependencies of the package.</p>

<p>Then remove egg file of that package:</p>

<pre><code>$ rm -rf .../python2.X/site-packages/[PACKAGE].egg
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>For listing installed python packages, you can use <code>yolk -l</code>. You'll need to easy_install yolk first though.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>Came across this question, while trying to uninstall the many random python packages installed over time.</p>

<p>Using information from this thread this is what I came up with:</p>

<p><code>cat package_list | xargs -n1 sudo pip uninstall -y</code></p>

<p>The package_list is cleaned up (awk) from a <code>pip freeze</code> in a virtualenv</p>

<p>To remove <em>almost</em> all python packages:</p>

<p><code>yolk -l | cut -f 1 -d " " | grep -v "setuptools|pip|ETC.." | xargs -n1 pip uninstall -y</code></p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>Guys, I just ran into the same problem on my mac... osx leopard 10.6.blah.</p>

<p>Solution is to make sure you're calling the mac ports python, ie </p>

<pre><code>sudo port install python26
sudo port install python_select
sudo python_select python26
sudo port install py26-mysql
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
