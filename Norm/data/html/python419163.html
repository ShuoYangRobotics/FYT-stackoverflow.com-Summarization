<h3>Question (ID-419163):</h3><h2>What does <if __name__=="__main__":> do?</h2><p>Kinda in relation to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/419145/python-threads-critical-section">this question</a>...</p>

<p>what does the <code>if __name__=="__main__":</code> part do?</p>

<pre><code># Threading example
import time, thread

def myfunction(string,sleeptime,lock,*args):
    while 1:
        lock.acquire()
        time.sleep(sleeptime)
        lock.release()
        time.sleep(sleeptime)
if __name__=="__main__":
    lock=thread.allocate_lock()
    thread.start_new_thread(myfunction, ("Thread #: 1", 2, lock))
    thread.start_new_thread(myfunction, ("Thread #: 2", 2, lock))
</code></pre>

<p>Also, what does <code>*args</code> mean in this example?</p>

<p>When the Python interpreter reads a source file, it executes all of the code found in it.  Before executing the code, it will define a few special variables.  For example, if the python interpreter is running that module (the source file) as the main program, it sets the special <code>__name__</code> variable to have a value <code>"__main__"</code>.  If this file is being imported from another module, <code>__name__</code> will be set to a different value.</p>

<p>In the case of your script, let's assume that it's executing as the main function, e.g. you said something like</p>

<pre><code>python threading_example.py
</code></pre>

<p>on the command line.  After setting up the special variables, it will execute the <code>import</code> statement and load those modules.  It will then evaluate the def block, creating a function object and creating a variable called <code>myfunction</code> that points to the function object.  It will then read the if statement and see that <code>__name__</code> does equal <code>"__main__"</code>, so it will execute the block shown there.</p>

<p>One of the reasons for doing this is that sometimes you write a module (a <code>.py</code> file) where it can be executed directly.  Alternatively, it can also be imported and used in another module.  By doing the main check, you can have that code only execute when you want to run the module as a program and not have it execute when someone just wants to import your module and call your functions themselves.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://ibiblio.org/g2swap/byteofpython/read/module-name.html" rel="nofollow">this page</a> for some extra details.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>When your script is run by passing it as a command to the Python interpreter,</p>

<pre><code>python myscript.py
</code></pre>

<p>all of the code that is at indentation level 0 gets executed.  Functions and classes that are defined are, well, defined, but none of their code gets ran.  Unlike other languages, there's no <code>main()</code> function that gets run automatically - the <code>main()</code> function is implicitly all the code at the top level.</p>

<p>In this case, the top-level code is an <code>if</code> block.  <code>__name__</code> is a built-in variable which evaluate to the name of the current module.  However, if a module is being run directly (as in <code>myscript.py</code> above), then <code>__name__</code> instead is set to the string <code>"__main__"</code>.  Thus, you can test whether your script is being run directly or being imported by something else by testing</p>

<pre><code>if __name__ == "__main__":
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>If that code is being imported into another module, the various function and class definitions will be imported, but the <code>main()</code> code won't get run.  As a basic example, consider the following two scripts:</p>

<pre><code># file one.py
def func():
    print("func() in one.py")

print("top-level in one.py")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("one.py is being run directly")
else:
    print("one.py is being imported into another module")

# file two.py
import one

print("top-level in two.py")
one.func()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("two.py is being run directly")
else:
    print("two.py is being imported into another module")
</code></pre>

<p>Now, if you invoke the interpreter as</p>

<pre><code>python one.py
</code></pre>

<p>The output will be</p>

<pre><code>top-level in one.py
one.py is being run directly
</code></pre>

<p>If you run <code>two.py</code> instead:</p>

<pre><code>python two.py
</code></pre>

<p>You get</p>

<pre><code>top-level in one.py
one.py is being imported into another module
top-level in two.py
func() in one.py
two.py is being run directly
</code></pre>

<p>Thus, when module <code>one</code> gets loaded, its <code>__name__</code> equals <code>"one"</code> instead of <code>__main__</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>The syntax <code>*args</code> in a function declaration lets you accept an arbitrary number of parameters (other than those explicitly named, like <code>string</code>, <code>sleeptime</code>,and <code>lock</code> in your example):</p>

<pre><code>def printStuff(*args):
    for arg in args:
    	print arg

printStuff(1, 2, "Hello World")

1
2
Hello World
</code></pre>

<p>The syntax <code>*args</code> in a function call lets you call with the items of the list <code>args</code> as further arguments:</p>

<pre><code>args = [4, 5, "Goodbye"]
printStuff(2, 3, *args)

2
3
4
5
Goodbye
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The simplest explanation (imho) is the following:</p>

<p>Create the following files.</p>

<pre><code># a.py
import b
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code># b.py
print "Hello World from %s!" % __name__

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print "Hello World from %s!" % __name__
</code></pre>

<p>Running them will get you this output:</p>

<pre><code>$ python a.py
Hello World from b!

$ python b.py
Hello World from __main__!
Hello World from __main__!
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>*args and **kwargs mean:</p>

<pre><code> def on_the_menu(arg, *args, **kwargs):
       print arg
       print args
       print kwargs

  &gt;&gt;&gt; on_the_menu(5, "spam", "eggs", "ham", sausage="and spam", spam="plenty")
  5
  ('spam', 'eggs', 'ham')
  {'sausage': 'and spam', 'spam': 'plenty'}
</code></pre>

<p>And <em>args</em> and <em>kwargs</em>  are only variable names. Name them as you like. For example <em>sausage</em> or <em>spam</em>. On the other hand, don't. :)</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p><code>if __name__ == "__main__"</code> is the part that runs when the script is run from (say) the command line using a command like <code>python myscript.py</code>.</p>

<p><code>*args</code> allows you to give the function more arguments than are explicitly required in the function definition.</p>
