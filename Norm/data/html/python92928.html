<h3>Question (ID-92928):</h3><h2>time.sleep -- sleeps thread or process?</h2><p>In Python for the *nix, does time.sleep() block the thread or the process?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-4):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>It blocks the thread.  If you look in Modules/timemodule.c in the Python source, you'll see that in the call to <code>floatsleep()</code>, the substantive part of the sleep operation is wrapped in a Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS and Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS block, allowing other threads to continue to execute while the current one sleeps.  You can also test this with a simple python program:</p>

<pre><code>import time
from threading import Thread

class worker(Thread):
    def run(self):
    	for x in xrange(0,11):
    		print x
    		time.sleep(1)

class waiter(Thread):
    def run(self):
    	for x in xrange(100,103):
    		print x
    		time.sleep(5)

def run():
    worker().start()
    waiter().start()
</code></pre>

<p>Which will print:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; thread_test.run()
0
100
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1
2
3
4
5
101

10
102
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Just the thread.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>It will just sleep the thread except in the case where your application has only a single thread, in which case it will sleep the thread and effectively the process as well.</p>

<p>The python documentation on sleep doesn't specify this however, so I can certainly understand the confusion!</p>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>yes, agree with Burly.</p>

<p>The thread will block, but the process is still alive.</p>

<p>In a single threaded application, this means everything is blocked while you sleep.  In a multithreaded application, only the thread you explicitly 'sleep' will block and the other threads still run within the process.</p>
