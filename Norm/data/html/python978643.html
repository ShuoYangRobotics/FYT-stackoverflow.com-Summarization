<h3>Question (ID-978643):</h3><h2>Vim, Python, and Django autocompletion (pysmell?)</h2><p>Does anyone know how to set up auto completion to work nicely with python, django, and vim?</p>

<p>I've been trying to use pysmell, but I can't seem to get it set up correctly (or maybe I don't know how it works). Right now, I run pysmell in the django directory (I'm using the trunk) and move the resulting tags to my project directory, then I also run pysmell in the project directory. Vim doesn't pick up the django tags, though, and they don't get auto completed.</p>

<p>Does anyone know how to set up auto completion in vim so that it will complete the long django functions (like get_object_or_404) as well as classes/functions in my own code? I have poked around on google but haven't found any good resources.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Here is the page I used as a reference: <a href="http://github.com/orestis/pysmell/tree/v0.6" rel="nofollow">PySmell v0.6 released : orestis.gr</a></p>

<ol>
<li>Install PySmell using the <code>setup.py install</code> command.</li>
<li>Generate the <code>PYSMELLTAGS</code> file for django by going to your <code>site-packages/django</code> directory and running: <code>pysmell . -o ~/PYSMELLTAGS.django</code></li>
<li>Copy that file to your project directory, and then ran <code>pysmell .</code> to generate the project PYSMELLTAGS file</li>
<li>Make sure pysmell is in your <code>PYTHONPATH</code> (<code>export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/pysmell/</code>)</li>
<li>Run vim (<code>vim .</code>)</li>
<li>Source <code>pysmell.vim</code> (<code>:source /path/to/pysmell/pysmell.vim</code>)</li>
<li>Set the autocomplete command (<code>:set omnifunc=pysmell#Complete</code>)</li>
<li>Type ^x^o to autocomplete and it should work</li>
</ol>

<p>I realize this is not a sustainable solution, but you should be able to use this as a start to getting it setup to always work (e.g., add the export to your .bashrc, add the :source to your .vimrc, setup <code>autocmd FileType python set omnifunc=pysmell#Complete</code>, etc.)</p>

<p>Let me know if this is enough to get you started. It worked for me!</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>
I simply added this to my .vimrc and as long as the <code>PYSMELLTAGS</code> &amp; <code>PYSMELLTAGS.django</code> files are in my project root, it works fine without any other work:</p>

<pre><code>python &lt;&lt; EOF
import os
import sys
import vim
sys.path.append("/usr/local/python/lib/python2.5/site-packages")
EOF
exe ":source ~/src/pysmell/pysmell.vim"
autocmd FileType python set omnifunc=pysmell#Complete
</code></pre>

<p>You can set up VIM with buffers, buffer display, auto complete, even Py Doc display.</p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I've had good luck with exuberant-ctags for this.</p>

<p>I use this macro in my vimrc:</p>

<pre>
execute 'map  :!/usr/bin/exuberant-ctags -f '.&tags.' --recurse '.$_P4ROOT.' '
</pre>

<p>You'll want to modify that slightly, so that it includes your python /site-packages/django/ directory as well as your own code.</p>

<p>Then, hit F2 inside vim to update the tags, and use the regular vim tag bindings to navigate.</p>
