<h3>Question (ID-60208):</h3><h2>Replacements for switch statement in python?</h2><p>I want to write a function in python that returns different fixed values based on the value of an input index.  In other languages I would use a switch or case statement, but python does not appear to have a switch statement.  What are the recommended python solutions in this scenario?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-18):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You could use a dictionary:</p>

<pre><code>def f(x):
    return {
        'a': 1,
        'b': 2,
    }[x]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>If you'd like defaults you could use the dictionary "get" method:</p>

<pre><code>def f(x):
    return {
        'a': 1,
        'b': 2,
        }.get(x, 9)    # 9 is default if x not found
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I've always liked doing it this way</p>

<pre><code>result = {
  'a': lambda x: x * 5,
  'b': lambda x: x + 7,
  'c': lambda x: x - 2
}[value](x)
</code></pre>

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>There's a pattern that I learned from Twisted Python code.</p>

<pre><code>class SMTP:
    def lookupMethod(self, command):
        return getattr(self, 'do_' + command.upper(), None)
    def do_HELO(self, rest):
        return 'Howdy ' + rest
    def do_QUIT(self, rest):
        return 'Bye'

SMTP().lookupMethod('HELO')('foo.bar.com') # =&gt; 'Howdy foo.bar.com'
SMTP().lookupMethod('QUIT')('') # =&gt; 'Bye'
</code></pre>

<p>You can use it any time you need to dispatch on a token and execute extended piece of code. In a state machine you would have <code> state_ </code> methods, and dispatch on <code>self.state</code>. This switch can be cleanly extended by inheriting from base class and defining your own <code> do_ </code> methods. Often times you won't even have <code> do_ </code> methods in the base class.</p>

<p><em>Edit: how exactly is that used</em></p>

<p>In case of SMTP you will receive <code>HELO</code> from the wire. The relevant code (from <code>twisted/mail/smtp.py</code>, modified for our case) looks like this</p>

<pre><code>class SMTP:
    # ...

    def do_UNKNOWN(self, rest):
        raise NotImplementedError, 'received unknown command'

    def state_COMMAND(self, line):
        line = line.strip()
        parts = line.split(None, 1)
        if parts:
            method = self.lookupMethod(parts[0]) or self.do_UNKNOWN
            if len(parts) == 2:
                return method(parts[1])
            else:
                return method('')
        else:
            raise SyntaxError, 'bad syntax'

SMTP().state_COMMAND('   HELO   foo.bar.com  ') # =&gt; Howdy foo.bar.com
</code></pre>

<p>You'll receive <code>'  HELO   foo.bar.com '</code> (or you might get <code>'QUIT'</code> or <code>'RCPT TO: foo'</code>). This is tokenized into <code>parts</code> as <code>['HELO', 'foo.bar.com']</code>. The actual method lookup name is taken from <code>parts[0]</code>.</p>

<p>(The original method is also called <code>state_COMMAND</code>, because it uses the same pattern to implement a state machine, i.e. <code>getattr(self, 'state_' + self.mode)</code>)</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>In addition to the dictionary methods (which I really like, BTW), you can also use if-elif-else to obtain the switch/case/default functionality:</p>

<pre><code>if x=='a':
    # Do the thing
elif x=='b':
    # Do the other thing
else:
    # Do the default
</code></pre>

<p>This of course is not identical to switch/case - you cannot have fall-through as easily as leaving off the break; statement, but you can have a more complicated test.  It's formatting is nicer than a series of nested ifs, even though functionally that's what it is closer to.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Let's say you don't want to just return a value, but want to use methods that change something on an object. Using the approach stated here would be:</p>

<pre><code>result = {
  'a': obj.increment(x),
  'b': obj.decrement(x)
}.get(value, obj.default(x))
</code></pre>

<p>What happens here is that python evaluates all methods in the dictionary.
So even if your value is 'a', the object will get incremented <strong>and</strong> decremented by x.</p>

<p>Solution:</p>

<pre><code>func, args = {
  'a' : (obj.increment, (x,)),
  'b' : (obj.decrement, (x,)),
}.get(value, (obj.default, (x,)))

result = func(*args)
</code></pre>

<p>So you get a list containing a function and its arguments. This way, only the function pointer and the argument list get returned, <em>not</em> evaluated. 'result' then evaluates the returned function call.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>expanding on the "dict as switch" idea. if you want to use a default value for your switch:</p>

<pre><code>def f(x):
    try:
        return {
            'a': 1,
            'b': 2,
        }[x]
    except KeyError:
        return 'default'
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>A true switch/case in Python is going to be more difficult than a dictionary method or if/elif/else methods because the simple versions do not support fall through. Another downfall of the if/elif/else method is the need for repeated comparisons. The C implementation of a switch/case has a performance benefit over if/else if/else in that only a single comparison is needed. The result of that comparison is used as an offset into a jump table (in the underlying asm generated). To mimicking the true functionality in Python would be a pain. Does any one have an implementation that would allow for fall through while only using a single comparison?</p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>If you are really just returning a predetermined, fixed value, you could create a dictionary with all possible input indexes as the keys, along with their corresponding values. Also, you might not really want a function to do this - unless you're computing the return value somehow.</p>

<p>Oh, and if you feel like doing something switch-like, see <a href="http://www.mustap.com/pythonzone_post_224_python-switch-statement" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#10</b><br /><p>I would just use if/elif/else statements. I think that it's good enough to replace the switch statement.</p>
<br /><b>#11</b><br /><p>I have made a (relatively) flexible and re-usable solution for this. It can be found at GitHub as <a href="http://gist.github.com/raw/23036/fd1fb6f05d4c654ff136a9f2545b9f83e9273fcc/switch.py" rel="nofollow">this gist</a>. If the result of the switch function is callable, it is automatically called.</p>
<br /><b>#12</b><br /><p>The solutions I use: </p>

<p>A combination of 2 of the solutions posted here, which is relatively easy to read and supports defaults.</p>

<p><code>result = {
  'a': lambda x: x * 5,
  'b': lambda x: x + 7,
  'c': lambda x: x - 2
}.get(whatToUse, lambda x: x - 22)(value)
</code></p>

<p>where
.get('c', lambda x: x - 22)(23)
-> looks up "lambda x: x - 2" in the dict and uses it with x=23 </p>

<p>.get('xxx', lambda x: x - 22)(44)
-> doesnÂ´t find it in the dict and uses the default "lambda x: x - 22" with x=44</p>
<br /><b>#13</b><br /><p>If you're searching extra-statement, as "switch", I built a python module that extends Python.It's called ESPY as Enhanced Structure for Python and it's available for both Python 2.x and Python 3.x.</p>

<p>For example, in this case, a switch statement could be performed by the following code:</p>

<pre><code>macro switch(arg1):
    while True:
        cont=False
        val=%arg1%
        socket case(arg2):
            if val==%arg2% or cont:
                cont=True
                socket
        socket else:
            socket
        break
</code></pre>

<p>that can be used like this:</p>

<pre><code>a=3
switch(a):
    case(0):
        print("Zero")
    case(1):
        print("Smaller than 2"):
        break
    else:
        print ("greater than 1")
</code></pre>

<p>so espy translate it in Python as:</p>

<pre><code>a=3
while True:
    cont=False
    if a==0 or cont:
        cont=True
        print ("Zero")
    if a==1 or cont:
        cont=True
        print ("Smaller than 2")
        break
    print ("greater than 1")
    break
</code></pre>

<p>You can find and test ESPY in this page:

<br /><b>#14</b><br /><pre><code>class switch( object ):
    value = None
    def __new__( class_, value ):
        class_.value = value
        return True

def case( *args ):
    return any( ( arg == switch.value for arg in args ) )
</code></pre>

<p>Usage:</p>

<pre><code>while switch( n ):
    if case( 0 ):
        print "You typed zero."
        break
    if case( 1, 4, 9 ):
        print "n is a perfect square."
        break
    if case( 2 ):
        print "n is an even number."
    if case( 2, 3, 5, 7 ):
        print "n is a prime number."
        break
    if case( 6, 8 ):
        print "n is an even number."
        break
    print "Only single-digit numbers are allowed."
    break
</code></pre>

<p>Tests:</p>

<pre><code>n = 2
#Result:
#n is an even number.
#n is a prime number.
n = 11
#Result:

<br /><b>#15</b><br /><p>My favorite one is a really nice <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/410692/" rel="nofollow">recipe</a>. You'll really like it. It's the closest one I've seen to actual switch case statements, especially in features.</p>

<p>Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code># The following example is pretty much the exact use-case of a dictionary,
# but is included for its simplicity. Note that you can include statements
# in each suite.
v = 'ten'
for case in switch(v):
    if case('one'):
        print 1
        break
    if case('two'):
        print 2
        break
    if case('ten'):
        print 10
        break
    if case('eleven'):
        print 11
        break
    if case(): # default, could also just omit condition or 'if True'
        print "something else!"
        # No need to break here, it'll stop anyway

# break is used here to look as much like the real thing as possible, but
# elif is generally just as good and more concise.

# Empty suites are considered syntax errors, so intentional fall-throughs
# should contain 'pass'
c = 'z'
for case in switch(c):
    if case('a'): pass # only necessary if the rest of the suite is empty
    if case('b'): pass
    # ...
    if case('y'): pass
    if case('z'):
        print "c is lowercase!"
        break
    if case('A'): pass
    # ...
    if case('Z'):
        print "c is uppercase!"
        break
    if case(): # default
        print "I dunno what c was!"

# As suggested by Pierre Quentel, you can even expand upon the
# functionality of the classic 'case' statement by matching multiple
# cases in a single shot. This greatly benefits operations such as the
# uppercase/lowercase example above:
import string
c = 'A'
for case in switch(c):
    if case(*string.lowercase): # note the * for unpacking as arguments
        print "c is lowercase!"
        break
    if case(*string.uppercase):
        print "c is uppercase!"
        break
    if case('!', '?', '.'): # normal argument passing style also applies
        print "c is a sentence terminator!"
        break
    if case(): # default
        print "I dunno what c was!"
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#16</b><br /><p>The switch statement is just syntactical sugar which is probably why Python doesn't have it. You can use if else statements for this functionality easily.</p>

<p>Like Matthew Schinckel said, you can use if and elif and else.</p>

<p>It is also a simple matter to have "fall-through" capabilities like most switch statements. All you have to do is not  use elif.</p>

<pre><code>if x == 1:
    # 1
if x == 2:
    # fall-through
elif x == 3:
    # not fall-through
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#17</b><br /><pre><code>def f(x):    
  return {'a': 1,'b': 2,}.get(x) or "Default"
</code></pre>
