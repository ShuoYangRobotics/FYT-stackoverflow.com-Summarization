<h3>Question (ID-36901):</h3><h2>What does ** and * do for python parameters?</h2><p>In the following method, what does the * and ** do for param2?  I'm new to Python...I assume it's a reference or pointer.  Answers?</p>

<pre><code>def foo(param1, *param2):
def bar(param1, **param2):
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The *args and **kwargs ist a common idiom to allow arbitrary number of arguments to functions as described in the section <a href="http://docs.python.org/dev/tutorial/controlflow.html#more-on-defining-functions" rel="nofollow">more on defining functions</a> in the  the python documentation.</p>

<p>The *args will give you all funtion parameters a a list:</p>

<pre><code>In [1]: def foo(*args):
   ...:     for a in args:
   ...:         print a
   ...:         
   ...:         

In [2]: foo(1)
1


In [4]: foo(1,2,3)
1
2
3
</code></pre>

<p>The **kwargs will give you all 
<strong>keyword arguments</strong> except for those corresponding to a formal parameter as a dictionary.</p>

<pre><code>In [5]: def bar(**kwargs):
   ...:     for a in kwargs:
   ...:         print a, kwargs[a]
   ...:         
   ...:         

In [6]: bar(name="one", age=27)
age 27
name one
</code></pre>

<p>Both idioms can be mixed with normal arguments to allow a set of fixed and some variable arguments:</p>

<pre><code>def foo(kind, *args, **kwargs):
   pass
</code></pre>

<p>An other usage of the *l idiom is to <strong>unpack argument lists</strong> when calling a function.</p>

<pre><code>In [9]: def foo(bar, lee):
   ...:     print bar, lee
   ...:     
   ...:     

In [10]: l = [1,2]

In [11]: foo(*l)
1 2
</code></pre>

<p>In the upcoming python 3.0 it will be possible to use *l on the left side of an assignment (<a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3132/" rel="nofollow">Extended Iterable Unpacking</a>):</p>

<pre><code>first, *rest = [1,2,3,4]
first, *l, last = [1,2,3,4]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>It's also worth noting that you can use * and ** when calling functions as well. This is a shortcut that allows you to pass multiple arguments to a function directly using either a list/tuple or a dictionary. For example, if you have the following function:</p>

<pre><code>def foo(x,y,z):
    print "x=" + str(x)
    print "y=" + str(y)
    print "z=" + str(z)
</code></pre>

<p>You can do things like:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; mylist = [1,2,3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo(*mylist)
x=1
y=2
z=3

&gt;&gt;&gt; mydict = {'x':4,'y':5,'z':6}
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo(**mydict)
x=4
y=5
z=6
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>The single * means that there can be any number of extra positional arguments. <code>foo()</code> can be invoked like <code>foo(1,2,3,4,5)</code>. In the body of foo() param2 is a sequence containing 2-5.</p>

<p>The double ** means there can be any number of extra named parameters. <code>bar()</code> can be invoked like <code>bar(1, a=2, b=3)</code>. In the body of bar() param2 is a dictionary containing {'a':2, 'b':3 }</p>

<p>With the following code:</p>

<pre><code>def foo(param1, *param2):
    print param1
    print param2

def bar(param1, **param2):
    print param1
    print param2

foo(1,2,3,4,5)
bar(1,a=2,b=3)
</code></pre>

<p>the output is</p>

<pre><code>1
(2, 3, 4, 5)
1
{'a': 2, 'b': 3}
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Also, it's a good idea not to populate your interface signatures with these conventions. It's okay to use them for private implementations, but for a public API, they can often obscure meaning. They're basically advertising, "Hey, this function/method accepts anything!".</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Peter's answer is exceptional.  I will only add that Python does not have function overloading like other languages, so to achieve the same effect, a programmer can use the *args and **kwargs conventions to allow the same function to be called with different inputs, similar to overloading.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>From the Python documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If there are more positional arguments than there are formal parameter slots, a TypeError exception is raised, unless a formal parameter using the syntax "*identifier" is present; in this case, that formal parameter receives a tuple containing the excess positional arguments (or an empty tuple if there were no excess positional arguments). </p>
  
  <p>If any keyword argument does not correspond to a formal parameter name, a TypeError exception is raised, unless a formal parameter using the syntax "**identifier" is present; in this case, that formal parameter receives a dictionary containing the excess keyword arguments (using the keywords as keys and the argument values as corresponding values), or a (new) empty dictionary if there were no excess keyword arguments. </p>
</blockquote>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I have to disagree when you say it's rare it's the only answer to a problem.</p>

<p>Actually, I have one problem right now which I believe could be very well solved using **kwargs. I have a class constructor which takes 20 parameters, 16 of them optional. Using **kwargs, I'd have only 5 parameters on the function definition and the effect would be the same with a much more organized code.</p>

<p>Of course, it's important that, when it's used, the user comments the whereabouts of the code to let possible readers know the reason this solution is being used.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>I second Zac, from a style and clarity point of view, using named function/method arguments is superior. If you use pyLint, it will yell at you whenever you get tempted by the dark-side of "* magic". That's not to say it's not necessary and/or useful, it's just that (in my opinion) it's rare it's the only answer to your problem.</p>
