<h3>Question (ID-118370):</h3><h2>How do you use the ellipsis slicing syntax in Python?</h2><p>This came up in  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/101268/hidden-features-of-python">Hidden features of Python</a>, but I can't see good documentation or examples that explain how the feature works.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-3):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The ellipsis is used to slice higher-dimensional data structures. </p>

<p>It's designed to mean <em>at this point, insert as many full slices (<code>:</code>) to extend the multi-dimensional slice to all dimensions</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from numpy import arange
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = arange(16).reshape(2,2,2,2)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, you have a 4-dimensional matrix of order 2x2x2x2. To select all first elements in the 4th dimension, you can use the ellipsis notation</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a[..., 0].flatten()
array([ 0,  2,  4,  6,  8, 10, 12, 14])
</code></pre>

<p>which is equivalent to</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a[:,:,:,0].flatten()
array([ 0,  2,  4,  6,  8, 10, 12, 14])
</code></pre>

<p>In your own implementations, you're free to ignore the contract mentioned above and use it for whatever you see fit.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You'd use it in your own class, since no builtin class makes use of it.</p>

<p>Numpy uses it, as stated in the <a href="http://www.scipy.org/Tentative%5FNumPy%5FTutorial#line-487" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>. Some examples <a href="http://www.scipy.org/Numpy%5FExample%5FList%5FWith%5FDoc#head-490d781b49b68b300eedaef32369fae7d58627fb" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>In your own class, you'd use it like this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class TestEllipsis(object):
...     def __getitem__(self, item):
...         if item is Ellipsis:
...             return "Returning all items"
...         else:
...             return "return %r items" % item
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = TestEllipsis()
&gt;&gt;&gt; print x[2]
return 2 items
&gt;&gt;&gt; print x[...]
Returning all items
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, there is the <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/bltin-ellipsis-object.html" rel="nofollow" title="Ellipsis">python documentation</a>, and <a href="http://docs.python.org/ref/slicings.html" rel="nofollow">language reference</a>. But those aren't very helpful. </p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>This is another use for Ellipsis, which has nothing to do with slices: I often use it in intra-thread communication with queues, as a mark that signals "Done"; it's there, it's an object, it's a singleton, and its name means "lack of", and it's not the overused None (which could be put in a queue as part of normal data flow). YMMV.</p>

<p>P.S: I don't mind downvotes, when what I say in an answer is not useful in relation to the question; then I try to improve my answer. But I sure can't understand how one can downvote <em>any</em> of the answers in this question— when the question is “how do <em>you</em> use the Ellipsis in Python”… It seems that people think that downvoting means “I disagree” or “I don't like this”.</p>
