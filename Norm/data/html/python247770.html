<h3>Question (ID-247770):</h3><h2>Retrieving python module path</h2><p>I want to detect whether module has changed. Now, using inotify is simple, you just need to know the directory you want to get notifications from.</p>

<p>How do I retrieve a module's path in python?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-4):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><pre><code>import a_module
print a_module.__file__
</code></pre>

<p>Will actually give you the path to the .pyc file that was loaded, at least on Mac OS X. So I guess you can do</p>

<pre><code>import os
path = os.path.dirname(amodule.__file__)
</code></pre>

<p>To get the directory to look for changes.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>This was trivial.</p>

<p>Each module has a <code>__file__</code> variable that shows its relative path from where you are right now.</p>

<p>Therefore, getting a directory for the module to notify it is simple as:</p>

<pre><code>os.path.dirname(__file__)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><pre><code>import os
path = os.path.abspath(__file__)
dir_path = os.path.dirname(path)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>As the other answers have said, the best way to do this is with <code>__file__</code> (demonstrated again below). However, there is an important caveat, which is that <code>__file__</code> does NOT exist if you are running the module on its own  (i.e. as <code>__main__</code>).</p>

<p>For example, say you have two files (both of which are on your PYTHONPATH):</p>

<pre><code>#/path1/foo.py
import bar
print bar.__file__
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>#/path2/bar.py
import os
print os.getcwd()
print __file__
</code></pre>

<p>Running foo.py will give the output:</p>

<pre><code>/path1        # "import bar" causes the line "print os.getcwd()" to run
/path2/bar.py # then "print __file__" runs
/path2/bar.py # then the import statement finishes and "print bar.__file__" runs
</code></pre>

<p>HOWEVER if you try to run bar.py on its own, you will get:</p>

<pre><code>/path2                              # "print os.getcwd()" still works fine
Traceback (most recent call last):  # but __file__ doesn't exist if bar.py is running as main
  File "/path2/bar.py", line 3, in &lt;module&gt;
    print __file__
NameError: name '__file__' is not defined 
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps. This caveat cost me a lot of time and confusion while testing the other solutions presented.</p>
