<h3>Question (ID-31875):</h3><h2>Is there a simple, elegant way to define Singletons in Python?</h2><p>There seem to be many ways to define Singletons in python. I was wondering if there is a consensus opinion on StackOverflow.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-13):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I don't really see the need, as a module with functions (and not a class) would serve well as a singleton. All its variables would be bound to the module, which could not be instantiated repeatedly anyways. </p>

<p>If you do wish to use a class, there is no way of creating private classes or private constructors in python, so you can't protect against multiple instantiations, other than just via convention in use of your API. I would still just put methods in a module, and consider the module as the singleton.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>A slightly different approach to implement the singleton in python is the <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/66531/" rel="nofollow">borg pattern</a> by Alex Martelli (google employee and python genius).</p>

<pre><code>class Borg:
    __shared_state = {}
    def __init__(self):
        self.__dict__ = self.__shared_state
</code></pre>

<p>So instead of forcing all instances to have the same identity they share state.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>override <strong>new</strong> method</p>

<pre><code>class Singleton(object):
    _instance = None
    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if not cls._instance:
            cls._instance = super(Singleton, cls).__new__(
                                cls, *args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instance


if __name__ == '__main__':
    s1=Singleton()
    s2=Singleton()
    if(id(s1)==id(s2)):
        print "Same"
    else:
        print "Different"
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The module approach works well. If I absolutely need a singleton I prefer the Metaclass approach.</p>

<pre><code>class Singleton(type):
    def __init__(cls, name, bases, dict):
        super(Singleton, cls).__init__(name, bases, dict)
        cls.instance = None 

    def __call__(cls,*args,**kw):
        if cls.instance is None:
            cls.instance = super(Singleton, cls).__call__(*args, **kw)
        return cls.instance

class MyClass(object):
    __metaclass__ = Singleton
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>@Serge: I like this quote from <a href="http://norvig.com/python-iaq.html" rel="nofollow">Norvig</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before the Gang of Four got all
  academic on us, ``singleton'' (without
  the formal name) was just a simple
  idea that deserved a simple line of
  code, not a whole religion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>@Staale, @John: I currently use the module approach, but was wondering whether I was missing a more widely accepted approach.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>The one time I wrote a singleton in Python I used a class where all the member functions had the classmethod decorator.</p>

<pre><code>class foo:
  x = 1

  @classmethod
  def increment(cls, y = 1):
    cls.x += y
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Being relatively new to python I'm not sure what the most common idiom is, but the simplest thing I can think of is just using a module instead of a class.  What would have been instance methods on your class become just functions in the module and any data just becomes variables in the module instead of members of the class.  I suspect this is the pythonic approach to solving the type of problem that people use singletons for.</p>

<p>If you really want a singleton class, there's a reasonable implementation described on the <a href="http://www.python.org/workshops/1997-10/proceedings/savikko.html" rel="nofollow">first hit on google</a> for "python singleton", specifically:</p>

<pre><code>class Singleton:
    __single = None
    def __init__( self ):
        if Singleton.__single:
            raise Singleton.__single
        Singleton.__single = self
</code></pre>

<p>That seems to do the trick.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Here is an example from Peter Norvig's Python IAQ <a href="http://norvig.com/python-iaq.html" rel="nofollow">How do I do the Singleton Pattern in Python?</a> (You should use search feature of your browser to find this question, there is no direct link, sorry)</p>

<p>Also Bruce Eckel has another example in his book <a href="http://www.mindview.net/Books/TIPython" rel="nofollow">Thinking in Python</a> (again there is no direct link to the code)</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>There are also some interesting articles on the Google Testing blog, discussing why singleton are/may be bad and are an anti-pattern:</p>

<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>I'm very unsure about this, but my project uses 'convention singletons' (not enforced singletons9, that is, if I have a class called DataController, I define this in the same module:</p>

<pre><code>_data_controller = None
def GetDataController():
    global _data_controller
    if _data_controller is None:
        _data_controller = DataController()
    return _data_controller
</code></pre>

<p>It is not elegant, since it's a full six lines. But all my singletons use this pattern, and it's at least very explicit (which is pythonic).</p>
<br /><b>#10</b><br /><p>Some people call singletons <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/scottdensmore/archive/2004/05/25/140827.aspx" rel="nofollow">evil</a>. I've certainly been bitten by unit-testing problems with them.</p>
<br /><b>#11</b><br /><pre><code>class Singleton(object[,...]):

    staticVar1 = None
    staticVar2 = None

    def __init__(self):
        if self.__class__.staticVar1==None :
            # create class instance variable for instantiation of class
            # assign class instance variable values to class static variables
        else:
            # assign class static variable values to class instance variables
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#12</b><br /><p>I think that <strong>forcing</strong> a class or an instance to be a Singleton is overkill. Personally, I like to define a normal instantiatable class, a semi-private reference, and a simple factory function.</p>

<pre><code>class NothingSpecial:
    pass

_the_one_and_only = None

def TheOneAndOnly():
    global _the_one_and_only
    if not _the_one_and_only:
        _the_one_and_only = NothingSpecial()
    return _the_one_and_only
</code></pre>

<p>or if there is no issue with instantiating when the module is first imported:</p>

<pre><code>class NothingSpecial:
    pass

THE_ONE_AND_ONLY = NothingSpecial()
</code></pre>

<p>That way you can write tests against fresh instances without side effects, no need for sprinkling the module with global statement and if needed you can derive variants in the future.</p>
