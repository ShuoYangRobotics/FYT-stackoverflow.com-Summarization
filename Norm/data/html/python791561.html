<h3>Question (ID-791561):</h3><h2>Python 2.5: JSON module</h2><p>I would like to use Python's <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/json.html" rel="nofollow">JSON</a> module. It was only introduced in Python 2.6 and I'm stuck with 2.5 for now. Is the particular JSON module provided with Python 2.6 available as a separate module that can be used with 2.5?</p>

  <p>Way late here, but how can you write a script to import either json or simplejson depending on the installed python version?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here's how:
<code><pre>
try:
    import json
except ImportError:
    import simplejson as json 
</pre></code></p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I prefer cjson since it's much faster: <a href="http://www.vazor.com/cjson.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.vazor.com/cjson.html</a></p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I wrote the cjson 1.0.6 patch and my advice is don't use cjson -- there are other problems with cjson in how it handles unicode etc.  I don't think the speed of cjson is worth dealing with the bugs -- encoding/decoding json is usually a very small bit of the time needed to process a typical web request...</p>

<p>json in python 2.6+ is basically simplejson brought into the standard library I believe...</p>
