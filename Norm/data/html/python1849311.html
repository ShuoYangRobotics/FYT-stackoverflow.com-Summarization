<h3>Question (ID-1849311):</h3><h2>How should I organize Python source code?</h2><p>I'm getting started with Python (it's high time I give it a shot), and I'm looking for some best practices.</p>

<p>My first project is a queue which runs command-line experiments in multiple threads. I'm starting to get a very long <code>main.py</code> file, and I'd like to break it up. In general, I'm looking for: <strong>How do python programmers organize multiple source files?</strong> Is there a particular structure that works for you?</p>

<p>My specific questions include:</p>

<ol>
<li>Should each class be in a separate file?</li>
<li>How should I organize unit tests relative to source code?</li>
<li>Where should I put doc comments, specifically those for command-line operation?</li>
<li>If I use multiple directories, how do I import classes between them?</li>
</ol>

<p>I can probably draw some of my own conclusions here by trial and error, but I'd rather start from something <em>good</em>.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The way you should organise your code and tests is exactly the same you would for any OO language. </p>

<p>Answers from the way I do it. It may not be right but works for me</p>

<ol>
<li>Depends on how your functionality is split. For my main python app I have 1 file with classes for the entry points and then packages of different bits of functionality</li>
<li>I use PyDev for eclipse and organise it like I would for Java. </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>&gt;  Workspace
&gt;     |
&gt;     |-Src
&gt;     |   |-Package1
&gt;     |   |-Package2
&gt;     |   |-main.py
&gt;     |-Test
&gt;         |-TestPackage1
&gt;         |-TestPackage2
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li>Use DocString everywhere to keep track of everything</li>
<li>After making sure that the relevant <strong>init</strong>.py files are in the folders. its just a simple case of <code>from module import class</code></li>
</ol>
