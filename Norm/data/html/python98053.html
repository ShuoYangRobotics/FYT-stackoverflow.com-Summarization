<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I've only used one, but I've had good results with Michael Foord's Mock: <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock.html</a>.</p>

<p>Michael's introduction says it better than I could:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are already several Python mocking libraries available, so why another one?</p>
  
  <p>Most mocking libraries follow the 'record -> replay' pattern of mocking. I prefer the 'action -> assertion' pattern, which is more readable and intuitive particularly when working with the Python unittest module.</p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>It also provides utility functions / objects to assist with testing, particularly monkey patching.</p>

<p>It's not perfect, but it is very powerful and flexible.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I've used <a href="http://pmock.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">pMock</a> in the past, and didn't mind it, it had pretty decent docs too. However, Foord's Mock as mentioned above is also nice.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.pydoubles.org" rel="nofollow">pyDoubles</a> the test doubles framework for Python, by iExpertos.com. It supports mocks, stubs, spies and matchers, including Hamcrest matchers</p>
