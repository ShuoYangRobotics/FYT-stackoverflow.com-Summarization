<h3>Question (ID-675442):</h3><h2>Comment out a python code block</h2><p>Is there any mechanism to comment out large blocks of Python code? Right
now the only ways I can see of commenting out code are to either start
every line with a #, or to enclose the code in """ (triple quotes),
except that actually makes it show up in various doc tools.</p>

<p>Edit--After reading the answers (and referring to the "duplicate"), I have concluded the correct answer is "No".  One person said so, and the rest lectured us about editors. Not a bad thing, but I feel it's important to put the answer at the top. </p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-13):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>No, Python does not have such a mechanism. Block comments are made by prepending each line with a pound sign. For more info, see good ol'-fashioned <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow"><strong>PEP 8</strong></a>. In any case, almost all Python IDEs support a mechanism to do the block-commenting-with-pound-signs automatically for you. For example, in IDLE on my machine, it's <code>Alt-3</code> and <code>Alt-4</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Don't use triple-quotes;</strong> as you discovered, this is for documentation strings, not block comments, although it has a similar effect. If you're just commenting things out temporarily, this is fine as a temporary measure.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The only cure I know for this is a good editor. Sorry. </p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Hide the triple quotes in a context that won't be mistaken for a docstring, eg:</p>

<pre><code>'''
...statements...
''' and None
</code></pre>

<p>or:</p>

<pre><code>if False: '''
...statements...
'''
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The only way you can do this without triple quotes is to add an:</p>

<pre><code>if False:
</code></pre>

<p>And then indent all your code.  Note that the code will still need to have proper syntax.</p>

<p>Many python IDE's can add # for you on each selected line, and remove them when un-commenting too.  Likewise if you use vi or emacs you can create a macro to do this for you for a block of code.</p>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>M-x comment-region, in emacs Python mode.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>At least in VIM you can select the first column of text you want to insert using Block Visual mode (<code>CTRL+V</code> in non-windows VIMs) and then prepend a <code>#</code> before each line using this sequence:</p>

<pre><code>I#&lt;esc&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In Block Visual mode <code>I</code> moves to insert mode with the cursor before the block on its first line.  The inserted text is copied before <em>each</em> line in the block.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>in vi:</p>

<p>go to top of block and mark it with letter a
go to bottom of block and mark it with letter b</p>

<p>then do</p>

<pre><code>:'a,'b s!^!#!
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>The only mechanism to comment out python code (understood as code ignored by the interpreter) is <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/lexical%5Fanalysis.html#id2" rel="nofollow">the #</a>.</p>

<p>As you say, you can also use <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/lexical%5Fanalysis.html#string-literals" rel="nofollow">string literals</a>, that are not ignored by the interpreter but can be completely irrelevant for the program execution.</p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>I use NotePad++ on a windows machine,   select your code,   type <code>CTRL-K</code>.   To uncomment you select code and press <code>CTRL-SHFT-K</code>.</p>

<p>Incidentally,  NotePad++ works nicely as a Python editor.  With auto-completion, code folding, syntax highlighting, and much more.   And its free as in speech and as in beer!!!</p>
<br /><b>#10</b><br /><p>Use a nice editor like SciTe, select your code, press Ctrl+Q and done.</p>

<p>If you don't have an editor that supports block comments you can use a triple quoted string at the start and the end of your code block to 'effectively' comment it out.  Not the best practice though.</p>
<br /><b>#11</b><br /><p>Triple quotes are OK to me.
You can use ''' foo ''' for docstrings and """ bar """ for comments or vice-versa to make the code more readable.</p>
<br /><b>#12</b><br /><pre><code>comm='''
Junk, or working code 
that I need to comment.
'''
</code></pre>

<p>You can replace <code>comm</code> by a variable of your choice that is perhaps shorter, easy to touch-type, and you know does not (and will not) occur in your programs. Examples: <code>xxx</code>, <code>oo</code>, <code>null</code>, <code>nil</code>.</p>
