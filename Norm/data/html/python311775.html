<h3>Question (ID-311775):</h3><h2>Python - Create a list with initial capacity</h2><p>Code like this often happens:</p>

<pre><code>l = []
while foo:
    #baz
    l.append(bar)
    #qux
</code></pre>

<p>This is really slow if you're about to append thousands of elements to your list, as the list will have to constantly be re-initialized to grow. (I understand that lists aren't just wrappers around some array-type-thing, but something more complicated. I think this still applies, though; let me know if not).</p>

<p>In Java, you can create an ArrayList with an initial capacity. If you have some idea how big your list will be, this will be a lot more efficient.</p>

<p>I understand that code like this can often be re-factored into a list comprehension. If the for/while loop is very complicated, though, this is unfeasible. Is there any equivalent for us python programmers?</p>

<p>Premature optimization is the root of all evil.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Python lists have no built-in pre-allocation. If you really need to make a list, and need to avoid the overhead of appending (and you should verify that you do), you can do this:</p>

<pre><code>l = [None] * 1000 # Make a list of 1000 None's
for i in xrange(1000):
    # baz
    l[i] = bar
    # qux
</code></pre>

<p>Perhaps you could avoid the list by using a generator instead:</p>

<pre><code>def my_things():
    while foo:
        #baz
        yield bar
        #qux

for thing in my_things():
    # do something with thing
</code></pre>

<p>This way, the list isn't every stored all in memory at all, merely generated as needed.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>i ran @s.lott's code and produced the same 10% perf increase by pre-allocating.  tried @jeremy's idea using a generator and was able to see the perf of the gen better than that of the doAllocate.  For my proj the 10% improvement matters, so thanks to everyone as this helps a bunch.</p>

<pre><code>def doAppend( size=10000 ):
    result = []
    for i in range(size):
        message= "some unique object %d" % ( i, )
        result.append(message)
    return result

def doAllocate( size=10000 ):
    result=size*[None]
    for i in range(size):
        message= "some unique object %d" % ( i, )
        result[i]= message
    return result

def doGen( size=10000 ):
    return list("some unique object %d" % ( i, ) for i in xrange(size))

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Short version: use</p>

<pre><code>pre_allocated_list = [None] * size
</code></pre>

<p>to pre-allocate a list (that is, to be able to address 'size' elements of the list instead of gradually forming the list by appending). This operation is VERY fast, even on big lists. Allocating new objects that will be later assigned to list elements will take MUCH longer and will be THE bottleneck in your program, performance-wise.</p>

<p>Long version:</p>

<p>I think that initialization time should be taken into account.
Since in python everything is a reference, it doesn't matter whether you set each element into None or some string - either way it's only a reference. Though it will take longer if you want to create new object for each element to reference.</p>

<p>For Python 3.2:</p>

<pre><code>import time
import copy

def print_timing (func):
  def wrapper (*arg):
    t1 = time.time ()
    res = func (*arg)
    t2 = time.time ()
    print ("{} took {} ms".format (func.__name__, (t2 - t1) * 1000.0))
    return res

  return wrapper

<p>As you can see, just making a big list of references to the same None object takes very little time. </p>

<p>Prepending or extending takes longer (i didn't average anything, but after running this a few times i can tell you that extending and appending take roughly the same time).</p>

<p>Allocating new object for each element - that is what takes the most time. And S.Lott's answer does that - formats a new string every time. Which is not strictly required - if you want to pre-allocate some space, just make a list of None, then assign data to list elements at will. Either way it takes more time to generate data than to append/extend a list, whether you generate it while creating the list, or after that. But if you want a sparsely-populated list, then starting with a list of None is definitely faster.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>From what I understand, python lists are already quite similar to ArrayLists. But if you want to tweak those parameters I found this post on the net that may be interesting (basically, just create your own <code>ScalableList</code> extension):</p>
