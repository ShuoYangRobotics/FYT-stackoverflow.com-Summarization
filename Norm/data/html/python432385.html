<h3>Question (ID-432385):</h3><h2>SFTP in Python? (platform independent)</h2><p>I'm working on a simple tool that transfers files to a hard-coded location with the password also hard-coded.  I'm a python novice, but thanks to ftplib, it was easy:</p>

<pre><code>import ftplib

info= ('someuser', 'password')    #hard-coded

def putfile(file, site, dir, user=(), verbose=True):
    """
    upload a file by ftp to a site/directory
    login hard-coded, binary transfer
    """
    if verbose: print 'Uploading', file
    local = open(file, 'rb')    
    remote = ftplib.FTP(site)   
    remote.login(*user)         
    remote.cwd(dir)
    remote.storbinary('STOR ' + file, local, 1024)
    remote.quit()
    local.close()
    if verbose: print 'Upload done.'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    site = 'somewhere.com'            #hard-coded
    dir = './uploads/'                #hard-coded
    import sys, getpass
    putfile(sys.argv[1], site, dir, user=info)
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that I can't find any library that supports sFTP.  What's the normal way to do something like this securely?  </p>

<p>Edit:  Thanks to the answers here, I've gotten it working with Paramiko and this was the syntax.</p>

<pre><code>import paramiko

host = "THEHOST.com"                    #hard-coded
port = 22
transport = paramiko.Transport((host, port))

password = "THEPASSWORD"                #hard-coded
username = "THEUSERNAME"                #hard-coded
transport.connect(username = username, password = password)

sftp = paramiko.SFTPClient.from_transport(transport)

import sys
path = './THETARGETDIRECTORY/' + sys.argv[1]    #hard-coded
localpath = sys.argv[1]
sftp.put(localpath, path)

sftp.close()
transport.close()
print 'Upload done.'
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks again!</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/" rel="nofollow">Twisted</a> can help you with what you are doing, check out their documentation, there are plenty of examples. Also it is a mature product with a big developer/user community behind it. </p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I'd stick with a <a href="http://www.lag.net/paramiko/" rel="nofollow">pure Python</a> solution, but it's not true that there aren't Windows ssh options.  <a href="http://cygwin.com/" rel="nofollow">Cygwin</a> has one, for example, and there are <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en-us&amp;q=windows+ssh&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">plenty more</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>If you want easy and simple, you might also want to look at <a href="http://docs.fabfile.org/0.9.0/" rel="nofollow">Fabric</a>. It's an automated deployment tool like Ruby's Capistrano, but simpler and ofcourse for Python. It's build on top of Paramiko.</p>

<p>You might not want to do 'automated deployment' but Fabric would suit your use case perfectly none the less. To show you how simple Fabric is: the fab file and command for your script would look like this (not tested, but 99% sure it will work):</p>

<p>fab_putfile.py:</p>

<pre><code>from fabric.api import *

env.hosts = ['THEHOST.com']
env.user = 'THEUSER'
env.password = 'THEPASSWORD'

def put_file(file):
    put(file, './THETARGETDIRECTORY/') # it's copied into the target directory
</code></pre>

<p>Then run the file with the fab command:</p>

<pre><code>fab -f fab_putfile.py put_file:file=./path/to/my/file
</code></pre>

<p>And your done! :)</p>
