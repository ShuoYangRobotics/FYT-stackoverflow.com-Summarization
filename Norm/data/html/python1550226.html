<h3>Question (ID-1550226):</h3><h2>python setup.py uninstall</h2><p>I have installed a python package with <code>python setup.py install</code>.</p>

<p>How do I uninstall it?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You need to remove all files manually, and also undo any other stuff that installation did manually.</p>

<p>If you don't know the list of all files, you can reinstall it with the <code>--record</code> option, and take a look at the list this produces.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Or more simply you could just do;</p>

<pre><code>sudo rm $(cat install.record)
</code></pre>

<p>This works because the rm command takes a whitespace-seperated list of files to delete and your installation record is just such a list.  Also, using "less" for this type of command could get you in big trouble depending on the local configuration.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>The lazy way: simply uninstall from the Windows installation menu (if you're using Windows), or from the rpm command, provided you first re-install it after creating a distribution package.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<pre><code>python setup.py bdist_wininst
dist/foo-1.0.win32.exe
</code></pre>

<p>("foo" being an example of course).</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Go to your python package directory and remove your .egg file,
e.g.:
In python 2.5(ubuntu): /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/</p>

<p>In python 2.6(ubuntu): /usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Extending on what Martin said, recording the install output and a little bash scripting does the trick quite nicely.  Here's what I do...</p>

<pre><code>for i in $(less install.record);
sudo rm $i;
done;
</code></pre>

<p>And presto.  Uninstalled.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Last answer helped me out so thanks for that. Not sure why I didn't think of it. Just a syntax correction though:</p>

<pre><code>for i in $(less install.record); sudo rm $i; done;
</code></pre>

<p>should be:</p>

<pre><code>for i in $(less install.record); do sudo rm $i; done;
</code></pre>

<p>otherwise you'll get a syntax error from bash. Also, be sure to change 'install.record' to whatever file you passed to your --record option. Not trying to be critical, just wanted to clarify in case someone who didn't know much about bash came across this post.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I would use <code>sudo pip uninstall &lt;package name&gt;</code></p>
