<h3>Question (ID-238081):</h3><h2>How do you log server errors on django sites</h2><p>So, when playing with the development I can just set <code>settings.DEBUG</code> to <code>True</code> and if an error occures I can see it nicely formatted, with good stack trace and request information.</p>

<p>But on kind of production site I'd rather use <code>DEBUG=False</code> and show visitors some standard error 500 page with information that I'm working on fixing this bug at this moment ;)<br />
At the same time I'd like to have some way of logging all those information (stack trace and request info) to a file on my server - so I can just output it to my console and watch errors scroll, email the log to me every hour or something like this.</p>

<p>What logging solutions would you recomend for a django-site, that would meet those simple requirements? I have the application running as <code>fcgi</code> server and I'm using apache web server as frontend (although thinking of going to lighttpd).</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-4):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Well, when <code>DEBUG = False</code>, Django will automatically mail a full traceback of any error to each person listed in the <code>ADMINS</code> setting, which gets you notifications pretty much for free. If you'd like more fine-grained control, you can write and add to your settings a middleware class which defines a method named <code>process_exception()</code>, which will have access to the exception that was raised:</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/http/middleware/#process-exception" rel="nofollow">http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/http/middleware/#process-exception</a></p>

<p>Your <code>process_exception()</code> method can then perform whatever type of logging you'd like: writing to console, writing to a file, etc., etc.</p>

<p>Edit: though it's a bit less useful, you can also listen for the <code>got_request_exception</code> signal, which will be sent whenever an exception is encountered during request processing:</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/signals/#got-request-exception" rel="nofollow">http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/signals/#got-request-exception</a></p>

<p>This does <em>not</em> give you access to the exception object, however, so the middleware method is much easier to work with.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Obviously James is correct, but if you wanted to log exceptions in a datastore there are a few opensource solutions already available:</p>

<p>1) CrashLog is a good choice: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-crashlog/" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/django-crashlog/</a></p>

<p>2) Db-Log is a good choice as well: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-db-log/" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/django-db-log/</a></p>

<p>What is the difference between the two? Almost nothing that I can see, so either one will suffice.</p>

<p>I've used both and the work well.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>django-db-log, mentioned in another answer, has been replaced with:</p>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Django Sentry is a good way to go, as already mentioned, but there is a bit of work involved in setting it up properly (as a separate website). If you just want to log everything to a simple text file here's the logging configuration to put in your <code>settings.py</code></p>

<pre><code>LOGGING = {
    'version': 1,
    'disable_existing_loggers': False,
    'handlers': {
        # Include the default Django email handler for errors
        # This is what you'd get without configuring logging at all.
        'mail_admins': {
            'class': 'django.utils.log.AdminEmailHandler',
            'level': 'ERROR',
             # But the emails are plain text by default - HTML is nicer
            'include_html': True,
        },
        # Log to a text file that can be rotated by logrotate
        'logfile': {
            'class': 'logging.handlers.WatchedFileHandler',
            'filename': '/var/log/django/myapp.log'
        },
    },
    'loggers': {
        # Again, default Django configuration to email unhandled exceptions
        'django.request': {
            'handlers': ['mail_admins'],
            'level': 'ERROR',
            'propagate': True,
        },
        # Might as well log any errors anywhere else in Django
        'django': {
            'handlers': ['logfile'],
            'level': 'ERROR',
            'propagate': False,
        },
        # Your own app - this assumes all your logger names start with "myapp."
        'myapp': {
            'handlers': ['logfile'],
            'level': 'WARNING', # Or maybe INFO or DEBUG
            'propogate': False
        },
    },
}
</code></pre>
