<h3>Question (ID-126753):</h3><h2>Is there a good, free Python IDE for Windows?</h2><p>Other than Notepad++, what text editor do you use to program in Windows? </p>

<p>Is there a good, free Python IDE for Windows?  I really need some good debugging abilities.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-28):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Try <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/" rel="nofollow">Eclipse</a> with <a href="http://pydev.org/" rel="nofollow">PyDev</a></p>

<p>I think it is the best one ;)</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Active State also offers <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/komodo_ide/komodo_edit.mhtml" rel="nofollow">Komodo Edit</a>.  I love it.</p>

<p>Debugging?  What specific needs do you have that you can't solve with the <code>print</code> statement?    Are you using the <code>assert</code> statement?  Are you using unit tests?</p>

<p>None of these things require elaborate IDE support.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Python for Windows ships with IDLE as part of the distribution. There is also </p>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/" rel="nofollow">PyCharm</a> from JetBrains is not free in general, but has free early access program. And it is surely worth looking at.</p>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>What about IronPython? It is integrated into Visual Studio / using a Visual Studio environment:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=IronPython" rel="nofollow">http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=IronPython</a></p>

<p>And it is free!</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I have been using Eclipse with PyDev for a while now.  Its pretty good but Eclipse is so bloated.  I regularly see it using 300Mb of memory on Windows.  It can hang and just be generally slow.  YMMV.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I heard about <a href="http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/" rel="nofollow">iPython</a> and am eager to check it out.  It's not an IDE so much as a super charged shell for python that will allow you to use your favorite editor alongside it.  There are some iPython related videos over on showmedo.com that may help you judge if it is going to meet your needs.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Try <a href="http://pytools.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">Python Tools for Visual Studio</a>. Supports CPython and IronPython.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/activepython/index.mhtml" rel="nofollow">ActiveState Python</a> comes with PythonWin which is reasonably good.  I use this for most Python development that I do on Windows.  However it does not have any GUI builders in it so you may need to look at what's available for your choice of GUI framework.</p>

<p>The debugger on PythonWin works fine, though and will let you set breakpoints, step through, show variables and all of the standard debugger facilities.</p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>Geany (<a href="http://www.geany.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.geany.org/</a>) is a fairly light text editor that does a lot of IDE-like stuff.  I use it for my Python development when I'm not on an Emacs kick, and I think I'm more productive with it than anything else.  It takes some work to get it all together on Windows, though.</p>
<br /><b>#10</b><br /><p>SPE - Stani's Python Editor, is pretty awesome. See <a href="http://pythonide.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://pythonide.blogspot.com/</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#11</b><br /><p>Python itself already has some some good debugging abilities.</p>

<p>You may want to take a look at the <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-pdb.html" rel="nofollow">pdb</a> module. It's great to set trace points and go through the programm one step at a time. It's console based and has no GUI though.</p>
<br /><b>#12</b><br /><p>Netbeans has support for python development in their <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/features/python/" rel="nofollow">Python Early Access</a> version. </p>

<p>If you've used Eclipse before, I'd recommend <a href="http://pydev.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">PyDev</a> as mentioned in other answers as the debugger and other features work just like any other language in eclipse. If you're coming from a differnt IDE, <a href="http://www.netbeans.org" rel="nofollow">Netbeans</a> is worth a try as I think it's a bit easier to switch to from other IDE's like dev studio.</p>

<p>I switch between <a href="http://pydev.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">pydev</a> and netbeans - they're both very good.</p>
<br /><b>#13</b><br /><p>If you do some searching, you will notice a lot of Pythonistas don't use full blown IDE's for development.  Have you looked at anything more lightweight?</p>

<p>check out SciTE: <a href="http://www.scintilla.org/SciTE.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.scintilla.org/SciTE.html</a> <br>
Also, check out Editra:  <a href="http://editra.org/" rel="nofollow">http://editra.org/</a> <br></p>

<p>Editra has a new plugin called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/editra-plugins/wiki/PyStudio" rel="nofollow" title="PyStudio">PyStudio</a>. It adds a Python debugger, Pylint and various other features.</p>

<p>(incidentally both are developed in python themselves)<br></p>

<p>I use SciTE for all Python development.  It has an integrated console, syntax highlighting, auto-complete and all the basics you need for lightweight development.</p>
<br /><b>#14</b><br /><p>On Windows, I use <a href="http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">Notepad++</a> with the appropriate settings.</p>
<br /><b>#15</b><br /><p>I have used "<a href="http://www.die-offenbachs.de/eric/index.html" rel="nofollow">The Eric Python IDE</a>" once and was quite pleased with it.</p>
<br /><b>#16</b><br /><p>BOa Constructor www.boa-constructor.sourceforge.net really nice! drag and drop stuff!</p>
<br /><b>#17</b><br /><p>DrPtyhon is also very nice, and has many plug-ins.  <a href="http://drpython.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">http://drpython.sourceforge.net/</a></p>
<br /><b>#18</b><br /><p>Sure there is... vim!</p>
<br /><b>#19</b><br /><p>I will make a plug for my preference of Python development environments: <a href="http://pythonide.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">SPE</a>. SPE is an integrated development environment that provides code completion, integrated Python shell, calltips, and various helper tools like notes and todo lists.</p>

<p>It also includes wxGlade so you can make wxPython applications easily. Plus, it includes the python debugger WinPdb.</p>
