<h3>Question (ID-48211):</h3><h2>Free Python decompiler that is not an online service?</h2><p>Is there a library or application that can decompile Python 2.4+ bytecode to obtain the source code?</p>

<p>A search revealed:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://depython.net" rel="nofollow">http://depython.net</a> - an online service that you need to upload a pyc or pyo file to</li>
<li>the <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-dis.html" rel="nofollow">dis module</a> - allows you to disassemble, but not decompile bytecode</li>
<li><a href="http://users.cs.cf.ac.uk/J.P.Giddy/python/decompiler/decompiler.html" rel="nofollow">decompile.py</a> - works only for 1.5.2 or  2.0</li>
<li>decompyle - an decompiling online service that you need to pay for and upload your pyc to</li>

<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>As others said, the free version of decompyle only works up to 2.3. But sometimes you can get it to work by converting your newer pyc to the old marshalling format.</p>

<p>The following script takes two arguments, the input and the output file, and converts it into something which decompyle will at least try its teeth on.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python
import marshal
import sys

MAGIC23 = ';\xf2\r\n'

def load_pyc(filename):
        f = open(filename, 'rb')
        try:
                magic = f.read(4)
                timestamp = f.read(4)
                codeobject = marshal.load(f)
        finally:
                f.close()
                return magic, timestamp, codeobject

def dump_pyc_23(filename, timestamp, codeobject):
        assert len(timestamp)==4
        f = open(filename, 'wb')
        try:
                f.write(MAGIC23)
                f.write(timestamp)
                marshal.dump(codeobject, f, 0)
        finally:
                f.close()

magic, timestamp, codeobject = load_pyc(sys.argv[1])
dump_pyc_23(sys.argv[2], timestamp, codeobject)
</code></pre>

<p>Good Luck!</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I've used decompyle (the Ubuntu package, not the online service, I don't know if they're the same thing, though) in the past and was more than satisfied with the results. It saved me hours of work after a <code>rm *.py</code> instead of <code>rm *.pyc</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I have a good experience with UnPyc - it perfectly recovered my Django models.py.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Here is a little more info on <code>decompyle</code>: this is the same software that became the commercial <a href="http://www.crazy-compilers.com/decompyle/" rel="nofollow">decompyle service</a>. It used to be open source and an old version of it is available/maintained as <a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/python/decompyle" rel="nofollow">a debian package</a> (including source code). </p>

<p>It will decompile Python up to version 2.3, but not 2.4+. </p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>There is a fork of decompyle called <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/unpyc/" rel="nofollow">unpyc</a> that has seen some activity recently. I tried using it with some pyc files but it didn't work with them.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I am incredibly surprised at the accuracy of <a href="http://depython.net" rel="nofollow">depython.net</a></p>

<p>What I think they do is use the dis module and reconstruct your code with it. You'll have to find a way to do that or someone who has written the algorithm already.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>You don't want an online service but depython.com is a good Python decompile service. Give it a try.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>This saved my life once: <a href="https://github.com/wibiti/uncompyle2" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/wibiti/uncompyle2</a> </p>

<p>Hope it helps </p>
