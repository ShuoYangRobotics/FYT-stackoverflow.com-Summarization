<h3>Question (ID-3220404):</h3><h2>Why use pip over easy_install?</h2><p>A <a href="http://twitter.com/jperras/statuses/18160589493" rel="nofollow">tweet</a> reads: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don't use easy_install, unless you
  like stabbing yourself in the face.
  Use pip.</p>

<p>Why use pip over easy_install? Doesn't the <a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/catalog-sig/2010-June/002985.html" rel="nofollow">fault lie with PyPI and package authors mostly</a>? If an author uploads crap source tarball (eg: missing files, no setup.py) to PyPI, then both pip and easy_install will fail. Other than cosmetic differences, why do Python people (like in the above tweet) seem to <strong>strongly</strong> favor pip over easy_install?</p>

<p>(Let's assume that we're talking about easy_install from the Distribute package, that is maintained by the community)</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-5):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>From Ian Bicking's own <a href="http://pip.openplans.org/#pip-compared-to-easy-install" rel="nofollow">introduction to pip</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>All packages are downloaded before installation. Partially-completed installation doesn’t occur as a result.</li>
  <li>Care is taken to present useful output on the console.</li>
  <li>The reasons for actions are kept track of. For instance, if a package is being installed, pip keeps track of why that package was required.</li>
  <li>Error messages should be useful.</li>
  <li>The code is relatively concise and cohesive, making it easier to use programmatically.</li>
  <li>Packages don’t have to be installed as egg archives, they can be installed flat (while keeping the egg metadata).</li>
  <li>Native support for other version control systems (Git, Mercurial and Bazaar)</li>
  <li>Uninstallation of packages.</li>
  <li>Simple to define fixed sets of requirements and reliably reproduce a set of packages.</li>
  </ul>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Two reasons, there may be more:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>pip provides an <code>uninstall</code> command</p></li>
<li><p>if an installation fails in the middle, pip will leave you in a clean state.</p></li>
</ol>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Another—as of yet unmentioned—reason for favoring <a href="http://pip.openplans.org/" rel="nofollow">pip</a> is because it is the new hotness and will continue to be used in the future. </p>

<p>The infographic below—from the <a href="http://guide.python-distribute.org/introduction.html#current-state-of-packaging" rel="nofollow">Current State of Packaging</a> section in the <a href="http://guide.python-distribute.org/index.html" rel="nofollow">The Hitchhiker's Guide to Packaging v1.0</a>—shows that setuptools/easy_install will go away in the future.</p>

<p>Here's another infographic from <a href="http://packages.python.org/distribute/" rel="nofollow">distribute's documentation</a> showing that setuptools and easy_install will be replaced by the new hotness—<a href="http://packages.python.org/distribute/" rel="nofollow">distribute</a> and <a href="http://pip.openplans.org/" rel="nofollow">pip</a>.</p>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>pip won't install binary packages and isn't well tested on Windows.</p>

<p>As Windows doesn't come with a compiler by default pip often <em>can't</em> be used there. easy_install <em>can</em> install binary packages for Windows.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>REQUIREMENTS files.</p>

<p>Seriously, I use this in conjunction with virtualenv every day.</p>
