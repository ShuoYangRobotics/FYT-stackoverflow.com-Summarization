<h3>Question (ID-1952464):</h3><h2>In python, how do I determine if a variable is Iterable?</h2><p>Is there a method like <code>isiterable</code>? The only solution I have found so far is to call</p>

<pre><code>getattr(myObj, '__iter__', False)

<p>But I am not sure how fool-proof this is.</p>

<pre><code>try:
    iterator = iter(theElement)
except TypeError:
    # not iterable
else:
    # iterable

# for obj in iterator:
#     pass
</code></pre>

<h2>Type checking</h2>

<p>Use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/abc.html" rel="nofollow">Abstract Base Classes</a>. They need at least Python 2.6 and work only for new-style classes.</p>

<pre><code>import collections

if isinstance(theElement, collections.Iterable):
    # iterable
else:
    # not iterable
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><strong>I</strong> Checking for <code>__iter__</code> works on sequence types, but it would fail on e.g. strings. I would like to know the right answer too, until then, here is one possibility (which would work on strings, too):</p>

<pre><code>try:
    some_object_iterator = iter(some_object)
except TypeError, te:
    print some_object, 'is not iterable'
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>iter</code> built-in:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; help(iter)
 1 Help on built-in function iter in module __builtin__:
 2 
 3 iter(...)
 4     iter(collection) -&gt; iterator
 5     iter(callable, sentinel) -&gt; iterator
 6     
 7     Get an iterator from an object.  In the first form, the argument must
 8     supply its own iterator, or be a sequence.
 9     In the second form, the callable is called until it returns the sentinel.
</code></pre>

<p><strong>II</strong> Another general pythonic approach is to assume an iterable, then fail gracefully if it does not work on the given object. The python glossary:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pythonic programming style that determines an object's type by inspection of its method or attribute signature rather than by explicit relationship to some type object ("If it looks like a <strong>duck</strong> and quacks like a <strong>duck</strong>, it must be a <strong>duck</strong>.") By emphasizing interfaces rather than specific types, well-designed code improves its flexibility by allowing polymorphic substitution. Duck-typing avoids tests using type() or isinstance(). <strong>Instead, it typically employs the EAFP (Easier to Ask Forgiveness than Permission) style of programming.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<pre><code>try:
    [ e for e in my_object]
except TypeError:
    print my_object, 'is not iterable'
</code></pre>

<p><strong>III</strong> The <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/collections.html#abcs-abstract-base-classes" rel="nofollow"><code>collections</code></a> module provides some abstract base classes, which allow to ask classes or instances if they provide particular functionality, for example:</p>

<pre><code>import collections

if isinstance(e, collections.Iterable):
    # e is iterable
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>This isn't sufficient: the object returned by <code>__iter__</code> must implement the iteration protocol (i.e. <code>next</code> method). See the relevant section in the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#iterator-types" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>.</p>

<p>In Python, a good practice is to " try and see " instead of "checking".</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You could try this:</p>

<pre><code>def iterable(a):
    try:
        (x for x in a)
        return True
    except TypeError:
        return False
</code></pre>

<p>If we can make a generator that iterates over it (but never use the generator so it doesn't take up space), it's iterable. Seems like a "duh" kind of thing. Why do you need to determine if a variable is iterable in the first place?</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><pre><code>try:
  #treat object as iterable
except TypeError, e:
  #object is not actually iterable
</code></pre>

<p>Don't run checks to see <s>if your duck really is a duck</s> to see if it is iterable or not, treat it as if it was and complain if it wasn't.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>On python &lt;= 2.5, you can't and shouldn't - iterable was an "informal" interface.</p>

<p>But since python2.6 and 3.0 you can leverage the new ABC (abstract base class) infrastructure along with some builtin ABCs which are available in the collections module:</p>

<pre><code>from collections import Iterable

class MyObject(object):
    pass

mo = MyObject()
print isinstance(mo, Iterable)
Iterable.register(MyObject)
print isinstance(mo, Iterable)

print isinstance("abc", Iterable)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, whether this is desiderable or actually works, is just a matter of conventions. As you can see, you <em>can</em> register a non-iterable object as Iterable - and it will raise an exception at runtime. Hence, isinstance acquires a "new" meaning - it just checks for "declared" type compatibility, which is a good way to go in Python.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if your object does not satifsy the interface you need, what are you going to do? take the following example:</p>

<pre><code>from collections import Iterable
from traceback import print_exc

def check_and_raise(x):
    if not isinstance(x, Iterable):
        raise TypeError, "%s is not iterable" % x
    else:
        for i in x:
            print i

def just_iter(x):
    for i in x:
        print i


class NotIterable(object):
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        check_and_raise(5)
    except:
        print_exc()
        print

    try:
        just_iter(5)
    except:
        print_exc()
        print



    try:
        Iterable.register(NotIterable)
        ni = NotIterable()
        check_and_raise(ni)
    except:
        print_exc()
        print
</code></pre>

<p>If the object doesn't satifsy what you expect, you just throw a TypeError, but if the proper ABC has been registered, your check is unuseful. On the contrary, if the <code>__iter__</code> method is available python will automatically recognize object of that class as being Iterable.</p>

<p>So, if you just expect an iterable, iterate over it and forget it. On the other hand, if you need to do different things depending on input type, you might find the ABC infrastracture pretty useful.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>The best solution I've found so far:</p>

<p><code>hasattr(obj, '__contains__')</code></p>

<p>which basically checks if the object implements the <code>in</code> operator.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong> (none of the other solutions has all three):</p>

<ul>
<li>it is an expression (works as a <strong>lambda</strong>, as opposed to the <strong>try...catch</strong> variant)</li>
<li>it is (should be) implemented by all iterables, including <strong>strings</strong> (as opposed to <code>__iter__</code>)</li>
<li>works on any Python >= 2.5</li>
</ul>

<p>Notes: </p>

<ul>
<li>the Python philosophy of "ask for forgiveness, not permission" doesn't work well when e.g. in a list you have both iterables and non-iterables and you need to treat each element differently according to it's type (treating iterables on try and non-iterables on except <em>would</em> work, but it would look butt-ugly and misleading)</li>
<li>solutions to this problem which attempt to actually iterate over the object (e.g. [x for x in obj]) to check if it's iterable may induce significant performance penalties for large iterables (especially if you just need the first few elements of the iterable, for example) and should be avoided</li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Found a nice solution <a href="http://bytes.com/topic/python/answers/514838-how-test-if-object-sequence-iterable" rel="nofollow">here</a>:</p>

<pre><code>isiterable = lambda obj: isinstance(obj, basestring) \
