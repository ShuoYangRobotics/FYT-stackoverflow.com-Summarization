<h3>Question (ID-1171584):</h3><h2>How can I parse JSON in Google App Engine?</h2><p>I'd like to parse a JSON string into an object under Google App Engine (python).  What do you recommend?  Something to encode/stringify would be nice too.  Is what you recommend built in, or a library that I have to include in my app?  Is it secure?  Thanks.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-5):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Consider using <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/serialization/" rel="nofollow">Django's json lib</a>, which is included with GAE.</p>

<pre><code>from django.utils import simplejson as json

# load the object from a string
obj = json.loads( string )
</code></pre>

<p>The link above has examples of Django's serializer, and here's the link for <a href="http://simplejson.googlecode.com/svn/tags/simplejson-2.0.9/docs/index.html" rel="nofollow">simplejson's documentation</a>.</p>

<p>If you're looking at storing Python class instances or objects (as opposed to compositions of lists, strings, numbers, and dictionaries), you probably want to look at <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/pickle.html" rel="nofollow">pickle</a>.</p>

<p>I hope that helps.</p>

<p>Incidentally, to get Django 1.0 (instead of Django 0.96) running on GAE, you can use the following call in your main.py, per <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/libraries.html#Django" rel="nofollow">this article</a>:</p>

<pre><code>from google.appengine.dist import use_library
use_library('django', '1.0')
</code></pre>

<p><em>Note:</em>
Obviously, if GAE moves to Python 2.6 or higher, you can simply <code>import json</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Include the <a href="http://www.undefined.org/python/" rel="nofollow">simplejson</a> library with your app? </p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Google is currently using Python 2.5 on Google App Engine. When/if google upgrades GAE to python 2.6, you can do the following:</p>

<pre><code>import json
out_json = json.dumps(in_dictionary_vals)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>If you're using Python2.6 or greater, I've used with success the built-in <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/json.html" rel="nofollow">json</a>.load function. Otherwise, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/simplejson/" rel="nofollow">simplejson</a> works on 2.4 without dependencies. </p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Look at the python section of <a href="http://json.org/" rel="nofollow">json.org</a>. The standard library support for JSON started at python 2.6, which I believe is newer than what the app engine provides. Maybe one of the other options listed?</p>
