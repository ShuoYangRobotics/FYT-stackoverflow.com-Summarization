<h3>Question (ID-136097):</h3><h2>What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?</h2><p>What is the difference between a function decorated with @staticmethod and one decorated with @classmethod?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>A staticmethod is a method that knows nothing about the class or instance it was called on. It just gets the arguments that were passed, no implicit first argument. It is basically useless in Python -- you can just use a module function instead of a staticmethod.</p>

<p>A classmethod, on the other hand, is a method that gets passed the class it was called on, or the class of the instance it was called on, as first argument. This is useful when you want the method to be a factory for the class: since it gets the actual class it was called on as first argument, you can always instantiate the right class, even when subclasses are involved. Observe for instance how <code>dict.fromkeys()</code>, a classmethod, returns an instance of the subclass when called on a subclass:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class DictSubclass(dict):
...     def __repr__(self):
...         return "DictSubclass"
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; dict.fromkeys("abc")
{'a': None, 'c': None, 'b': None}
&gt;&gt;&gt; DictSubclass.fromkeys("abc")
DictSubclass
&gt;&gt;&gt;

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Maybe a bit of example code will help: Notice the difference in the call signatures of foo, class_foo and static_foo:</p>

<pre><code>class A(object):
    def foo(self,x):
        print "executing foo(%s,%s)"%(self,x)

    @classmethod
    def class_foo(cls,x):
        print "executing class_foo(%s,%s)"%(cls,x)

    @staticmethod
    def static_foo(x):
        print "executing static_foo(%s)"%x


a=A()
</code></pre>

<p>Below is the usual way an object instance calls a method. The object instance, a, is implicitly passed as the first argument.</p>

<pre><code>a.foo(1)
# executing foo(&lt;__main__.A object at 0xb7dbef0c&gt;,1)
</code></pre>

<p>With classmethods, the class of the object instance is implicitly passed as the first
 argument instead of self.</p>

<pre><code>a.class_foo(1)
# executing class_foo(&lt;class '__main__.A'&gt;,1)
</code></pre>

<p>You can also call class_foo using the class. In fact, if you define something to be
a classmethod, it is probably because you intend to call it from the class rather than from a class instance. <code>A.foo(1)</code> would have raised a TypeError, but <code>A.class_foo(1)</code> works just fine:</p>

<pre><code>A.class_foo(1)
# executing class_foo(&lt;class '__main__.A'&gt;,1)
</code></pre>

<p>Next time you reach for the @classmethod decorator, however, <a href="http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.2/descrintro/#metaclasses" rel="nofollow">this statement by Guido van Rossum</a> might give you reason to pause: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ironically, there are now no known
  uses for class methods in the Python
  distribution.... I might even get rid
  of classmethod in a future release if
  no good use for it can be found!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With staticmethods, neither self (the object instance) nor  cls (the class) is
implicitly passed as the first argument. </p>

<pre><code>a.static_foo(1)
# executing static_foo(1)
</code></pre>

<p>foo is just a function, but when you call a.foo you don't just get the function,
you get a "curried" version of the function with the object instance "a" bound as the first argument to the function. foo expects 2 arguments, while a.foo only expects 1 argument.</p>

<p>"a" is bound to foo. That is what is meant by the term "bound" below:</p>

<pre><code>print(a.foo)
# &lt;bound method A.foo of &lt;__main__.A object at 0xb7d52f0c&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>With <code>a.class_foo</code>, "a" is not bound to foo, rather the class A is bound to foo.</p>

<pre><code>print(a.class_foo)
# &lt;bound method type.class_foo of &lt;class '__main__.A'&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here, with a staticmethod, even though it is a method, a.static_foo just returns
a good 'ole function with no arguments bound. static_foo expects 1 argument, and
a.static_foo expects 1 argument too.</p>

<pre><code>print(a.static_foo)
# &lt;function static_foo at 0xb7d479cc&gt;
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Basically @classmethod makes a method who's first argument is the class it's called from (rather than the class instance), @staticmethod does not have any implicit arguments.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p><a href="http://rapd.wordpress.com/2008/07/02/python-staticmethod-vs-classmethod/" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is a short article on this question</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>@staticmethod function is nothing more than a function defined inside a class. It is callable without instantiating the class first. It’s definition is immutable via inheritance.</p>
  
  <p>@classmethod function also callable without instantiating the class, but its definition follows Sub class, not Parent class, via inheritance. That’s because the first argument for @classmethod function must always be cls (class).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A class method receives the class as
  implicit first argument, just like an
  instance method receives the instance.
  To declare a class method, use this
  idiom:</p>
  
  <p>class C:
      @classmethod
      def f(cls, arg1, arg2, ...): ... The @classmethod form is a function
  decorator – see the description of
  function definitions in Function
  definitions for details.</p>
  
  <p>It can be called either on the class
  (such as C.f()) or on an instance
  (such as C().f()). The instance is
  ignored except for its class. If a
  class method is called for a derived
  class, the derived class object is
  passed as the implied first argument.</p>
  
  <p>Class methods are different than C++
  or Java static methods. If you want
  those, see staticmethod() in this
  section.</p>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p><code>@staticmethod</code> just disables the default function as method descriptor.  classmethod wraps your function in a container callable that passes a reference to the owning class as first argument:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class C(object):
...  pass
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; def f():
...  pass
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; staticmethod(f).__get__(None, C)
&lt;function f at 0x5c1cf0&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; classmethod(f).__get__(None, C)
&lt;bound method type.f of &lt;class '__main__.C'&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As a matter of fact, <code>classmethod</code> has a runtime overhead but makes it possible to access the owning class.  Alternatively I recommend using a metaclass and putting the class methods on that metaclass:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class CMeta(type):
...  def foo(cls):
...   print cls
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; class C(object):
...  __metaclass__ = CMeta
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; C.foo()
&lt;class '__main__.C'&gt;
</code></pre>

<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Staticmethod is <em>not</em> useless. since it is not passed an implicit class or instance of class as first argument, it is useful for processing class attributes that spans instances.</p>
