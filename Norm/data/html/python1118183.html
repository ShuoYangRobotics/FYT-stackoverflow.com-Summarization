<h3>Question (ID-1118183):</h3><h2>How to debug in Django, the good way?</h2><p>So, I started learning to code in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python%5F%28programming%5Flanguage%29" rel="nofollow">Python</a> and later <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django%5F%28web%5Fframework%29" rel="nofollow">Django</a>. The first times it was hard looking at tracebacks and actually figure out what I did wrong and where the syntax error was. Some time has passed now and some way along the way, I guess I got a routine in debugging my Django code. As this was done early in my coding experience, I sat down and wondered if how I was doing this was ineffective and could be done faster. I usually manage to find and correct the bugs in my code, but I wonder if I should be doing it faster?</p>

<p>I usually just use the debug info Django gives when enabled. When things do end up as I thought it would, I break the code flow a lot with a syntax error, and look at the variables at that point in the flow to figure out, where the code does something other than what I wanted.</p>

<p>But can this be improved? Are there some good tools or better ways to debug your Django code?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>There are a bunch of ways to do it, but the most straightforward is to simply 
use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-pdb.html" rel="nofollow">Python debugger</a>. Just add following line in to a Django view function:</p>

<pre><code>import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
</code></pre>

<p>If you try to load that page in your browser, the browser will hang and you get a prompt to carry on debugging on actual executing code.</p>

<p>However there are other options suggested by others (I won't recommend them):</p>

<pre><code>* return HttpResponse({variable to inspect})

* print {variable to inspect}

* raise Exception({variable to inspect})
</code></pre>

<p>But the Python Debugger (pdb) is highly recommended for all types of Python code. If you are already into pdb, you'd also want to have a look at ipdb that uses ipython for debugging. Happy Coding.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>There are a few tools that cooperate well and can make your debugging task easier.</p>

<p>Most important is the <a href="http://github.com/robhudson/django-debug-toolbar/tree/master" rel="nofollow">Django debug toolbar</a>.</p>

<p>Then you need good logging using the Python <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/logging.html#module-logging" rel="nofollow">logging</a> facility.  You can send logging output to a log file, but an easier option is sending log output to <a href="http://github.com/darwin/firepython/tree/master" rel="nofollow">firepython</a>.  To use this you need to use the Firefox browser with the <a href="http://getfirebug.com/" rel="nofollow">firebug</a> extension. Firepython includes a firebug plugin that will display any server-side logging in a Firebug tab.</p>

<p>Firebug itself is also critical for debugging the Javascript side of any app you develop.  (Assuming you have some JS code of course).</p>

<p>I also liked <a href="http://eric.themoritzfamily.com/2009/02/17/announcing-django-viewtools/" rel="nofollow">django-viewtools</a> for debugging views interactively using pdb, but I don't use it that much.</p>

<p>There are more useful tools like dozer for tracking down memory leaks (there are also other good suggestions given in answers here on SO for memory tracking).</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I really like <a href="http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/" rel="nofollow">Werkzeug</a>'s interactive debugger. It's similar to Django's debug page, except that you get an interactive shell on every level of the traceback. If you use the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-command-extensions/" rel="nofollow">django-extensions</a>, you get a <code>runserver_plus</code> managment command which starts the development server and gives you Werkzeug's debugger on exceptions.</p>

<p>Of course, you should only run this locally, as it gives anyone with a browser the rights to execute arbitrary python code in the context of the server.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>A little quickie for template tags:</p>

<pre><code>@register.filter 
def pdb(element):
    import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
    return element
</code></pre>

<p>Now, inside a template you can do <code>{{ template_var|pdb }}</code> and enter a pdb session (given you're running the local devel server) where you can inspect <code>element</code> to your heart's content.</p>

<p>It's a very nice way to see what's happened to your object when it arrives at the template. </p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Almost everything has been mentioned so far, so I only add that instead of <code>pdb.set_trace()</code> one can use <strong>ipdb.set_trace()</strong> which uses iPython and therefore is more powerful (autocomplete and other goodies). This requires ipdb package, so one need to <code>easy_install ipdb</code></p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I use <a href="http://www.pydev.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">pyDev</a> with Eclipse really good, set break points, step into code, view values on any objects and variables, try it.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I use <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/" rel="nofollow">PyCharm</a> (same pydev engine as eclipse).  Really helps me to visually be able to step through my code and see what is happening.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>I've pushed <code>django-pdb</code> to <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-pdb" rel="nofollow">PyPI</a>.
It's a simple app that means you don't need to edit your source code every time you want to break into pdb.</p>

<p>Installation is just...</p>

<ol>
<li><code>pip install django-pdb</code></li>
<li>Add <code>'django_pdb'</code> to your <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code></li>
</ol>

<p>You can now run: <code>manage.py runserver --pdb</code> to break into pdb at the start of every view...</p>

<pre><code>bash: manage.py runserver --pdb
