<h3>Question (ID-855759):</h3><h2>Python try-else</h2><p>I am just now learning Python, and I came across an interesting construct.  In Python, the <code>try</code> block has an optional <code>else</code> block.  Other than providing a new scope after the try exits normally, what does the <code>else</code> block do for you?  Or is that just it?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-10):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The statements in the <code>else</code> block are executed if execution falls off the bottom of the <code>try</code> - if there was no exception. Honestly, I've never found a need.</p>

<p>However, <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/errors.html#handling-exceptions" rel="nofollow">Handling Exceptions</a> notes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The use of the else clause is better
  than adding additional code to the try
  clause because it avoids accidentally
  catching an exception that wasnâ€™t
  raised by the code being protected by
  the try ... except statement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, if you have a method that could, for example, throw an <code>IOError</code>, and you want to catch exceptions it raises, but there's something else you want to do if the first operation succeeds, and you <em>don't</em> want to catch an IOError from that operation, you might write something like this:</p>

<pre><code>    try:
        operation_that_can_throw_ioerror()
    except IOError:
        handle_the_exception_somehow()
    else:
         # we don't want to catch the IOError if it's raised
        another_operation_that_can_throw_ioerror()
    finally:
        something_we_always_need_to_do()
</code></pre>

<p>If you just put <code>another_operation_that_can_throw_ioerror()</code> after <code>operation_that_can_throw_ioerror</code>, the <code>except</code> would catch the second call's errors. And if you put it after the whole <code>try</code> block, it'll always be run, and not until after the <code>finally</code>. The <code>else</code> lets you make sure</p>

<ol>
<li>the second operation's only run if there's no exception,</li>
<li>it's run before the <code>finally</code> block, and</li>
<li>any <code>IOError</code>s it raises aren't caught here</li>
</ol>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>One use: test some code that should raise an exception.</p>

<pre><code>try:
    this_should_raise_TypeError()
except TypeError:
    pass
except:
    assert False, "Raised the wrong exception type"
else:
    assert False, "Didn't raise any exception"
</code></pre>

<p>(This code should be abstracted into a more generic test in practice.)</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I find it really useful when you've got cleanup to do that has to be done even if there's an exception:</p>

<pre><code>try:
    data = something_that_can_go_wrong()
except Exception, e: # yes, I know that's a bad way to do it...
    handle_exception(e)
else:
    do_stuff(data)
finally:
    clean_up()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Never used it myself. Looking at <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/compound%5Fstmts.html" rel="nofollow">Python reference</a> it seems that <code>else</code> is executed after <code>try</code> when there's no exception.
The optional else clause is executed if and when control flows off the end of the try clause. [2] Exceptions in the else clause are not handled by the preceding except clauses.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.diveintopython.org/file%5Fhandling/index.html" rel="nofollow">Dive into python</a> has and example where, if I understand correctly, in <code>try</code> block they try to import a module, when that fails you get exception and bind default but when it works you have an option to go into <code>else</code> block and bind what is required (see link for the example and explanation).</p>

<p>If you tried to do work in <code>catch</code> block it might throw another exception - I guess that's where the <code>else</code> block comes handy.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>There's a nice example of <code>try-else</code> in <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0380/#id9" rel="nofollow">PEP 380</a>. Basically, it comes down to doing different exception handling in different parts of the algorithm.</p>

<p>It's something like this:</p>

<pre><code>try:
    do_init_stuff()
except:
    handle_init_suff_execption()
else:
    try:
        do_middle_stuff()
    except:
        handle_middle_stuff_exception()
</code></pre>

<p>This allows you to write the exception handling code nearer to where the exception occurs.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Even though you can't think of a use of it right now, you can bet there has to be a use for it. Here is an unimaginative sample out of my head:</p>

<pre><code>a = [1,2,3]
try:
    something = a[2]
except:
    print "out of bounds"
else:
    print something


try:
    something = a[2]
except:
    print "out of bounds"

if "something" in locals():
    print something
</code></pre>

<p>Here you have the variable "something" defined if no error is thrown. You can remove this outside the try block, but then it requires some messy detection if a variable is defined.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>That's it. The 'else' block of a try-except clause exists for code that runs when (and only when) the tried operation succeeds. It can be used, and it can be abused.</p>

<pre><code>try:
    fp= open("configuration_file", "rb")
except EnvironmentError:
    confdata= '' # it's ok if the file can't be opened
else:
    confdata= fp.read()
    fp.close()

# your code continues here
# working with (possibly empty) confdata
</code></pre>

<p>Personally, I like it and use it when appropriate. It semantically groups statements.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>An <code>else</code> block can often exist to complement functionality that occurs in every <code>except</code> block.</p>

<pre><code>try:
    test_consistency(valuable_data)
except Except1:
    inconsistency_type = 1
except Except2:
    inconsistency_type = 2
except:
    # Something else is wrong
    raise
else:
    inconsistency_type = 0

"""
Process each individual inconsistency down here instead of
inside the except blocks. Use 0 to mean no inconsistency.
"""
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, <code>inconsistency_type</code> is set in each except block, so that behaviour is complemented in the no-error case in <code>else</code>.</p>

<p>Of course, I'm describing this as a pattern that may turn up in your own code someday. In this specific case, you just set <code>inconsistency_type</code> to 0 before the <code>try</code> block anyway.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>Perhaps a use might be:</p>

<pre><code>#debug = []

def debuglog(text, obj=None):
    " Simple little logger. "
    try:
        debug   # does global exist?
    except NameError:
        pass    # if not, don't even bother displaying
    except:
        print('Unknown cause. Debug debuglog().')
    else:
        # debug does exist.
        # Now test if you want to log this debug message
        # from caller "obj"
        try:
            if obj in debug:
                print(text)     # stdout
        except TypeError:
            print('The global "debug" flag should be an iterable.')
        except:
            print('Unknown cause. Debug debuglog().')

def myfunc():
    debuglog('Made it to myfunc()', myfunc)

debug = [myfunc,]
myfunc()
</code></pre>

<p>Maybe this will lead you too a use.</p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>The <code>else:</code> block is confusing and (nearly) useless.  It's also part of the <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> statements.</p>

<p>Actually, even on an <code>if</code>-statement, the <code>else:</code> can be abused in truly terrible ways creating bugs that are very hard to find.</p>

<p>Consider this.</p>

<pre><code>   if a &lt; 10:
       # condition stated explicitly
   elif a &gt; 10 and b &lt; 10:
       # condition confusing but at least explicit
   else:
       # Exactly what is true here?
       # Can be hard to reason out what condition is true
</code></pre>

<p>Think twice about <code>else:</code>.  It is generally a problem.  Avoid it except in an <code>if</code>-statement and even then consider documenting the <code>else</code>- condition to make it explicit.</p>
