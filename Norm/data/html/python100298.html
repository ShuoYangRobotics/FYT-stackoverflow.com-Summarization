<h3>Question (ID-100298):</h3><h2>Code Analysis In Python</h2><p>What tools are good to use for code analysis in python?</p>

<p>I have a large source repository split across multiple projects, and I would like to be able to run tools across the directories to see details like Cyclomatic Complexity, and perhaps be able to spot errors using static analysis.</p>

<p>Ideally, I would like to be able to produce a report about the health of the source code, so we can spot problem areas that need to be addressed.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-10):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>For static analysis there is <a href="http://www.logilab.org/857" rel="nofollow">pylint</a> and <a href="http://pychecker.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">pychecker</a>. Personally I use pylint as it seems to be more comprehensive than pychecker. </p>

<p>For cyclomatic complexity you can try <a href="http://www.journyx.com/curt/complexity.html" rel="nofollow">this perl program</a>, or this <a href="http://www.traceback.org/2008/03/31/measuring-cyclomatic-complexity-of-python-code/" rel="nofollow">article</a> which introduces a python program to do the same</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>For measuring cyclomatic complexity, there's a nice tool available at <a href="http://www.traceback.org/2008/03/31/measuring-cyclomatic-complexity-of-python-code/" rel="nofollow">traceback.org</a>.  The page also gives a good overview of how to interpret the results.</p>

<p>+1 for <a href="http://www.logilab.org/project/pylint" rel="nofollow">pylint</a>.  It is great at verifying adherence to coding standards (be it <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow">PEP8</a> or your own organization's variant), which can in the end help to reduce cyclomatic complexity.</p>

<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>The <a href="http://www.semanticdesigns.com/Products/Clone/PythonCloneDR.html" rel="nofollow">SD Python CloneDR</a> is a tool for finding exact and near-miss copies of cloned code across large Python systems. </p>

<p>By parsing Python according to its grammar, the CloneDR can use the code structure itself to help find clones in spite of different indentation, reformatting, addition/change of comments, renamed variables, and some statement insertions/deletions.</p>

<p>CloneDR also works for other langauges such as Java, C++, C#, ...</p>

<p>Sample clone detection reports can be found at the website.</p>

<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>There is a tool called 
<a href="http://clonedigger.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">CloneDigger</a> that helps you find similar code snippets.</p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>I have used <a href="http://www.logilab.org/project/pylint" rel="nofollow">pylint</a> which does some higher analysis, but mostly its things like empty except blocks and the kind.</p>

<p>A quick googeling also found <a href="http://www.journyx.com/curt/complexity.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>, a perl program that analysis cyclomatic complexity of python programs. I'm sceptic...</p>
