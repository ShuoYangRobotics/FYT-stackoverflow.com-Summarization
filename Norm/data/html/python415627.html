<h3>Question (ID-415627):</h3><h2>Big Web 2.0 sites written in Python?</h2><p>Hulu, Twitter, Techcrunch, etc are written in Ruby.<br />
Yahoo, Facebook, and tons of big social networks are written in PHP.</p>

<p>But what are some big top-name enterprise sites written in Python?</p>

<p>I am going to spend my time investing in either Python (w/ Django) or Ruby (w/ Rails) to create a data-intensive web application that has a personalization/recommendation tool (similar to Amazon).</p>

<p>Coming from a PHP background (OOP, Zend Framework), which would be best?</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>What aspect of "big" are you interested in? </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Scaling - either of Python/Django or Ruby/Rails will almost certainly handle any type of traffic you're going to throw at it. </p></li>
<li><p>Large code base - similar maintainability between RoR and Django. It comes down to personal preference (I prefer Python)</p></li>
<li><p>Support and community - both RoR and Django have large, active, helpful communities. Neither are going away, both are healthy and growing, used by both large and small entities.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I don't think you'll find the "big site" aspect to be a particularly helpful determinant of what you use. Both are easy to pick up; try them out and see what feels more natural to you. I tried both, liked both initially, but ended up strongly preferring Django.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>A huge chunk of Google's website is implemented in Python.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>We are using Django on <a href="http://www.noovo.com" rel="nofollow">Noovo</a>, currently about 50k lines of code. I would choose <a href="http://webpy.org" rel="nofollow">web.py</a> if I had to do it again. We also do recommendations etc. </p>

<p>Btw, you won't make it without unit tests, so have everything covered from the start.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/" rel="nofollow">Django</a> is used to run a wide variety of sites.  You can see all the ones that have been registered at <a href="http://www.djangosites.org/" rel="nofollow">www.djangosite.org</a>.  Since Django was born from developers working in the news industry, you'll find that a lot of news organizations have quickly embraced it.</p>

<p>However, as djangosites illustrates, its been used for everything from personal blogs, to photo sharing sites, to social networks (<a href="http://cloud27.com/" rel="nofollow">Cloud27</a> was specifically built to show off the <a href="http://pinaxproject.com/" rel="nofollow">Pinax</a> social networking suite).  <a href="http://pownce.com/" rel="nofollow">Pownce</a>, a social network based around music and file sharing, was written using Django, but its creators had to close their doors when they were hired elsewhere.</p>

<p>Its also worth noting that the <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/" rel="nofollow">Google App Engine</a> uses Django's template language. Not specifically Python, but heavily influenced by a Python framework.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>As Autoplectic <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/415627/big-web-2-0-sites-written-in-python#415668">said</a>, Reddit was rewritten from Lisp to Python.<br />

<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>It looks like Google help files are all in Python.</p>

<p>Example: <a href="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=69570&amp;topic=13260" rel="nofollow">http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=69570&amp;topic=13260</a> </p>

<p>See the answer.py? That's a Python script.</p>

<p>(Unless of course they did something unnatural with the .py extension... But I doubt it.)</p>

<br /><b>#10</b><br /><p>Ok, this might be not an enterprise class site, but for a gaming nerd like me, <a href="http://www.curse.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.curse.com</a> is written in python.</p>
<br /><b>#11</b><br /><p>Django was used by <a href="http://pownce.com/" rel="nofollow">Pownce</a> but they were bought out by another company. I think because they wanted Pownce's talented team rather than their twitter like web application.</p>
<br /><b>#12</b><br /><p>Andalucia.org is using Django (all except home page, that will be migrated soon). Some links:</p>
