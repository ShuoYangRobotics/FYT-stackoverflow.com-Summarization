<h3>Question (ID-111234):</h3><h2>What is a "callable" in Python?</h2><p>Now that it's clear <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/100003/what-is-a-metaclass-in-python">what a metaclass is</a>, there is an associated concept that I use all the time without knowing what it really means. </p>

<p>I suppose everybody made once a mistake with parenthesis, resulting  in an "object is not callable" exception. What's more, using __init__ and __new__ lead to wonder what this bloody __call__ can be used for.</p>

<p>Could you give me some explanations, including examples with the magic method ?</p>

<p>The <a href="http://svn.python.org/projects/python/trunk/Objects/object.c" rel="nofollow">buildin <em>callable</em> (PyCallable_Check in objects.c)</a> checks if the argument is either:</p>

<ul>
<li>an instance of a class with a <em>__call__</em> method or</li>
<li>is of a type that has a non null <em>tp_call</em> (c struct) member which indicates callability otherwise (such as in functions, methods etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>The method named <em>__call__</em> is (<a href="http://docs.python.org/ref/callable-types.html" rel="nofollow">according to the documentation</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Called when the instance is ``called'' as a function</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Example</h2>

<pre><code>class Foo:
  def __call__(self):
    print 'called'

foo_instance = Foo()
foo_instance() #this is calling the __call__ method
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>From Python's sources <a href="http://svn.python.org/view/python/trunk/Objects/object.c?rev=64962&amp;view=markup" rel="nofollow">object.c</a>:</p>

<pre><code>/* Test whether an object can be called */

int
PyCallable_Check(PyObject *x)
{
    if (x == NULL)
        return 0;
    if (PyInstance_Check(x)) {
        PyObject *call = PyObject_GetAttrString(x, "__call__");
        if (call == NULL) {
            PyErr_Clear();
            return 0;
        }
        /* Could test recursively but don't, for fear of endless
           recursion if some joker sets self.__call__ = self */
        Py_DECREF(call);
        return 1;
    }
    else {
        return x-&gt;ob_type-&gt;tp_call != NULL;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>It says:</p>

<ol>
<li>If an object is an instance of some class then it is callable <em>iff</em> it has <code>__call__</code> attribute.</li>
<li>Else the object <code>x</code> is callable <em>iff</em> <code>x-&gt;ob_type-&gt;tp_call != NULL</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Desciption of <a href="http://docs.python.org/api/type-structs.html" rel="nofollow"><code>tp_call</code> field</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>ternaryfunc tp_call</code> An optional
  pointer to a function that implements
  calling the object. This should be
  NULL if the object is not callable.
  The signature is the same as for
  PyObject_Call(). This field is
  inherited by subtypes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can always use built-in <code>callable</code> function to determine whether given object is callable or not; or better yet just call it and catch <code>TypeError</code> later. <code>callable</code> is removed in Python 3.0 and 3.1, use <code>callable = lambda o: hasattr(o, '__call__')</code> or <code>isinstance(o, collections.Callable)</code>.</p>

<p>Example, a simplistic cache implementation:</p>

<pre><code>class Cached:
    def __init__(self, function):
        self.function = function
        self.cache = {}

    def __call__(self, *args):
        try: return self.cache[args]
        except KeyError:
            ret = self.cache[args] = self.function(*args)
            return ret    
</code></pre>

<p>Usage:</p>

<pre><code>@Cached
def ack(x, y):
    return ack(x-1, ack(x, y-1)) if x*y else (x + y + 1) 
</code></pre>

<p>Example from standard library, file <a href="http://svn.python.org/projects/python/trunk/Lib/site.py" rel="nofollow"><code>site.py</code></a>, definition of built-in <code>exit()</code> and <code>quit()</code> functions:</p>

<pre><code>class Quitter(object):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def __repr__(self):
        return 'Use %s() or %s to exit' % (self.name, eof)
    def __call__(self, code=None):
        # Shells like IDLE catch the SystemExit, but listen when their
        # stdin wrapper is closed.
        try:
            sys.stdin.close()
        except:
            pass
        raise SystemExit(code)
__builtin__.quit = Quitter('quit')
__builtin__.exit = Quitter('exit')
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>@<a href="#111445" rel="nofollow">Kevin Little</a>:  That is wrong.  <code>__call__</code> of the object type is called.  And because it's a descriptor, it doesn't show up in <code>dir()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; type(int).__call__(int)
0
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(object).__call__(object)
&lt;object object at 0x523460&gt;
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>A callable is an object allows you to use round parenthesis ( ) and eventually pass some parameters, just like functions.</p>

<p>Every time you define a function python creates a callable object. 
In example, you could define the function <strong>func</strong> in these ways (it's the same):</p>

<pre><code>class a(object):
    def __call__(self, *args):
        print 'Hello'

func = a()

# or ... 
def func(*args):
    print 'Hello'
</code></pre>

<p>You could use this method instead of methods like <strong>doit</strong> or <strong>run</strong>, I think it's just more clear to see obj() than obj.doit()</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>A Callable is an object that has the <code>__call__</code> method.  This means you can fake callable functions or do neat things like <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0309/" rel="nofollow">Partial Function Application</a> where you take a function and add something that enhances it or fills in some of the parameters, returning something that can be called in turn (known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying" rel="nofollow">Currying</a> in functional programming circles).</p>

<p>Certain typographic errors will have the interpreter attempting to call something you did not intend, such as (for example) a string.  This can produce errors where the interpreter attempts to execute a non-callable application.  You can see this happening in a python interpreter by doing something like the transcript below.</p>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Quite simply, a "callable" is something that can be called like a method.  The built in function "callable()" will tell you whether something appears to be callable, as will checking for a <strong>call</strong> property.  Functions are callable as are classes, class instances can be callable.  See more about this <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/built-in-funcs.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.peterbe.com/plog/callable-python-objects" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p><code>__call__</code> makes any object be callable as a function.</p>

<p>This example will output 8:</p>

<pre><code>class Adder(object):
  def __init__(self, val):
    self.val = val

  def __call__(self, val):
    return self.val + val

func = Adder(5)
print func(3)

<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Guy, "callable is something than can be called" is not really a good definition, do you realize that ? It's like saying that a voting machine is a machine that allow you to vote, that does not add any value.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>In Python a callable is an object which type has a <code>__call__</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class Foo:
...  pass
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; class Bar(object):
...  pass
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(Foo).__call__(Foo)
&lt;__main__.Foo instance at 0x711440&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(Bar).__call__(Bar)
&lt;__main__.Bar object at 0x712110&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; def foo(bar):
...  return bar
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(foo).__call__(foo, 42)
42
</code></pre>

<p>As simple as that :)</p>

<p>This of course can be overloaded:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class Foo(object):
...  def __call__(self):
...   return 42
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; f = Foo()
&gt;&gt;&gt; f()
42
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>It's something you can put "(args)" after and expect it to work.  A callable is usually a method or a class.  Methods get called, classes get instantiated.</p>
<br /><b>#10</b><br /><p>Good examples <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110625071757/http://diveintopython.org/power_of_introspection/built_in_functions.html#apihelper.builtin.callable" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
