<h3>Question (ID-4750806):</h3><h2>How to install pip on windows?</h2><p>pip is a replacement for easy_install. But I will install pip using easy_install on Windows. Is there a better way?</p>

<p>Edit: </p>

<p>This also seems to work:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download the last easy installer for Windows that fits your installed python version: (download the .exe at the bottom of <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools" rel="nofollow">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools</a> ). Install it.</li>
<li>Add <code>c:\Python2x\Scripts</code> to the Windows path</li>
<li>Open a new (!) DOS prompt. From there run <code>easy_install pip</code></li>
</ol>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-3):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>As you mentioned pip doesn't include an independent installer, but you can install it easily with its predecessor easy_install.</p>

<p>So:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download the last pip version from here: <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip#downloads" rel="nofollow">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip#downloads</a></li>
<li>Uncompress it</li>
<li>Download the last easy installer for Windows: (download the .exe at the bottom of <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools" rel="nofollow">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools</a> ). Install it.</li>
<li>go to the uncompressed pip directory and:  <code>python setup.py install</code></li>
<li>Add your python c:\Python2x\Scripts to the path</li>
</ol>

<p>You are done. </p>

<p>Now you can use <code>pip install package</code> to easily install packages as in Linux :)</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>When I have to use Windows, I use ActivePython, which automatically adds everything to your PATH and includes a package manager called <a href="http://code.activestate.com/pypm/" rel="nofollow">PyPM</a> which provides <em>binary</em> package management making it faster and simpler to install packages.</p>

<p><code>pip</code> and <code>easy_install</code> aren't exactly the same thing, so there are some things you can get through <code>pip</code> but not <code>easy_install</code> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3220404/why-use-pip-over-easy-install/3224103#3224103">and vice versa</a>.</p>

<p>My recommendation is that you get <a href="http://www.activestate.com/activepython/downloads" rel="nofollow">ActivePython Community Edition</a> and don't worry about the huge hassle of getting everything set up for Python on Windows. Then, you can just use <code>pypm</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>To install pip <em>globally</em> on Python 2.x, easy_install appears to be the best solution as Adri√°n states.</p>

<p>However the <a href="http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html" rel="nofollow">installation instructions</a> for pip recommend using <a href="http://www.virtualenv.org" rel="nofollow">virtualenv</a> since every virtualenv has pip installed in it automatically.  This does not require root access or modify your system Python installation.</p>

<p>Installing virtualenv still requires easy_install though.</p>
