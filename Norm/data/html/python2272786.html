<h3>Question (ID-2272786):</h3><h2>Python issue:Unable to find vcvarsall.bat</h2><p>I'm trying to install MySql interface for python,but I got an error(mentioned below).And I know the solution,install the Microsoft Visual C++.So what my question is there any alternative solution apart from installing Microsoft Visual C++,I mean it's really hurt me,why should I install Microsoft Visual C++ just because to build this single package it's a useless and time wasting approach from the developers perspective.So I kindly request from all of you please mention if you have any alternative solution for this issue.</p>

<p>I've compiled once for MySQL1.2.3c1 for Python2.6, you could find it <a href="http://soemin.googlecode.com/files/MySQL-python-1.2.3c1.win32-py2.6.exe" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are important differences between the several versions of VC++.
  The most important discrepancy is the runtime library version. Each
  version of Visual Studio uses its own msvcrt dll. The command line
  options, deprecated functions, project file formats and other things are
  also slightly different. </p>
