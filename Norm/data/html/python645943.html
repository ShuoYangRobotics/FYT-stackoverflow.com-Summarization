<h3>Question (ID-645943):</h3><h2>MySQL for Python in Windows</h2><p>I am finding it difficult to use MySQL with Python in my windows system.</p>

<p>I am currently using Python 2.6. I have tried to compile MySQL-python-1.2.3b1 (which is supposed to work for Python 2.6 ?) source code using the provided setup scripts. The setup script runs and it doesn't report any error but it doesn't generate _mysql module. </p>

<p>I have also tried setting up MySQL for Python 2.5 with out success. The problem with using 2.5 is that Python 2.5 is compiled with visual studio 2003 (I installed it using the provided binaries). I have visual studio 2005 on my windows system. Hence setuptools fails to generate _mysql module.</p>

<p>Any help ?</p>

<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg%5Fid=5808948" rel="nofollow">This discussion</a> has some tips about getting rid of the deprecation warning.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>This may read like your grandpa givin advice, but all answers here did not mention the best way: go nd install <a href="http://www.activestate.com/activepython/downloads" rel="nofollow">ActivePython</a> instead of python.org windows binaries. I was really wondering for a long time why Python development on windows was such a pita - until I installed activestate python. I am not affiliated with them. It is just the plain truth. Write it on every wall: <strong>Python development on Windows = ActiveState</strong>! 
you then just <a href="http://code.activestate.com/pypm/mysql-python/" rel="nofollow"><code>pypm install mysql-python</code></a> and everything works smoothly. <strong>no compile orgy. no strange errors. no terror.</strong> Just start coding anddoing real work after five minutes. 
This is the only way to go on windows. Really.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I found a location were one person had successfully built mysql for python2.6, sharing the link, <a href="http://www.technicalbard.com/files/MySQL-python-1.2.2.win32-py2.6.exe" rel="nofollow">http://www.technicalbard.com/files/MySQL-python-1.2.2.win32-py2.6.exe</a></p>

<p>...you might see a warning while import MySQLdb which is fine and that wonâ€™t hurt anything,</p>

<p>C:\Python26\lib\site-packages\MySQLdb__init__.py:34: DeprecationWarning: the sets module is deprecated
from sets import ImmutableSet</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>As Python newbie learning the Python ecosystem I've just completed this.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Install setuptools <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/309412/how-to-setup-setuptools-for-python-2-6-on-windows">instructions</a></p></li>
<li><p>Install MySQL 5.1. Download the 97.6MB MSI from <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.1.html#win32" rel="nofollow">here</a> You can't use the essentials version because it doesnt contain the C libraries.<br />
Be sure to select a custom install, and mark the development tools / libraries for installation as that is not done by default. This is needed to get the C header files.<br />
You can verify you have done this correctly by looking in your install directory for a folder named "include". E.G C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.1\include. It should have a whole bunch of .h files.</p></li>
<li><p>Install Microsoft Visual Studio C++ Express 2008 from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/express/vc/" rel="nofollow">here</a> This is needed to get a C compiler.</p></li>
<li><p>Open up a command line as administrator (right click on the Cmd shortcut and then "run as administrator". Be sure to open a fresh window <em>after</em> you have installed those things or your path won't be updated and the install will still fail.</p></li>
<li><p>From the command prompt:</p>

<p>easy_install -b C:\temp\sometempdir mysql-python</p>

<p>That will fail - which is OK.</p>

<p>Now open site.cfg in your temp directory C:\temp\sometempdir and edit the "registry_key" setting to:</p>

<p>registry_key = SOFTWARE\MySQL AB\MySQL Server 5.1</p>

<p>now CD into your temp dir and:</p>

<p>python setup.py clean</p>

<p>python setup.py install </p>

<p>You should be ready to rock!</p></li>

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>What about <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pymysql/" rel="nofollow">pymysql</a>?  It's pure Python, and I've used it on Windows with considerable success, bypassing the difficulties of compiling and installing mysql-python.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You can try to use the myPySQL, its realy easy to use it, no compilation for windows, and even if you need to compilate it for any reason, you only need python and visual C installed, don't need mysql installed.</p>

<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>You're not the only person having problems with Python 2.6 and MySQL (<a href="http://blog.contriving.net/2009/03/04/using-python-26-mysql-on-windows-is-nearly-impossible/" rel="nofollow">http://blog.contriving.net/2009/03/04/using-python-26-mysql-on-windows-is-nearly-impossible/</a>). Here's an explanation how it should run under Python 2.5 <a href="http://i.justrealized.com/2008/04/08/how-to-install-python-and-django-in-windows-vista/" rel="nofollow">http://i.justrealized.com/2008/04/08/how-to-install-python-and-django-in-windows-vista/</a>
Good luck</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>There are <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group%5Fid=22307&amp;package%5Fid=15775" rel="nofollow">Windows binaries for MySQL-Python (2.4 &amp; 2.5) available on Sourceforge</a>.  Have you tried those?</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>Because I am running python in a (pylons/pyramid) virtualenv, I could not run the binary installers (helpfully) linked to previously. </p>

<p>I had problems following the steps with Willie's answer, but I determined that the problem is (probably) that I am running windows 7 x64 install, which puts the registry key for mysql in a slightly different location, specifically in my case (note: I am running version 5.5) in: "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\MySQL AB\MySQL Server 5.5".</p>

<p>HOWEVER, "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\" cannot be included in the path or it will fail.</p>

<p>Also, I had to do a restart between steps 3 and 4.</p>

<p>After working through all of this, IMO it would have been smarter to run the entire python dev environment from cygwin.</p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>You might want to also consider making use of <a href="http://cygwin.org" rel="nofollow">Cygwin</a>, it has mysql python libraries in the repository. </p>
