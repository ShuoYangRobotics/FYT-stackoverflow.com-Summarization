<h3>Question (ID-115316):</h3><h2>How can I consume a WSDL (SOAP) web service in Python?</h2><p>I want to use a WSDL SOAP based web service in Python. I have looked at the <a href="http://diveintopython.org/soap_web_services/" rel="nofollow">Dive Into Python</a> code but the SOAPpy module does not work under Python 2.5.</p>

<p>I have tried using <a href="https://fedorahosted.org/suds" rel="nofollow">suds</a> which works partly, but breaks with certain types (suds.TypeNotFound: Type not found: 'item').</p>

<p>I have also looked at <a href="http://trac.optio.webfactional.com/wiki" rel="nofollow">Client</a> but this does not appear to support WSDL.</p>

<p>And I have looked at <a href="http://pywebsvcs.sourceforge.net/zsi.html" rel="nofollow">ZSI</a> but it looks very complex. Does anyone have any sample code for it?</p>

<p>The WSDL is https://ws.pingdom.com/soap/PingdomAPI.wsdl and works fine with the PHP 5 SOAP client.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Right now, all the SOAP libraries available for python suck. I recommend avoiding SOAP if possible. The last time we where forced to use a SOAP web service from python, we wrote a wrapper in C# that handled the SOAP on one side and spoke COM out the other. </p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I would recommend that you have a look at <a href="https://fedorahosted.org/suds/" rel="nofollow">SUDS</a></p>

<p>"Suds is a lightweight SOAP python client for consuming Web Services."</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I always write my own at the HTTP level.  It's really not that hard.  I wrote the <a href="http://www.lyonsreg.com/products/python.asp" rel="nofollow">example here</a> which should be a good starting point for you.  Let me know if you have questions.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I know this is an old thread but it was showing up at the top of google results so I wanted to share a more current discussion on Python and SOAP.</p>

<p>See: <a href="http://www.diveintopython.org/soap%5Fweb%5Fservices/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.diveintopython.org/soap%5Fweb%5Fservices/index.html</a></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>If you're rolling your own I'd highly recommend looking at <a href="http://effbot.org/zone/element-soap.htm" rel="nofollow">http://effbot.org/zone/element-soap.htm</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>It's not true SOAPpy does not work with Python 2.5 - it works, although it's very simple and really, really basic. If you want to talk to any more complicated webservice, ZSI is your only friend.</p>

<p>The really useful demo I found is at <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/webservices/tutorials/python" rel="nofollow">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/webservices/tutorials/python</a> - this really helped me to understand how ZSI works.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>SOAPpy is now obsolete, AFAIK, replaces by ZSL. It's a moot point, because I can't get either one to work, much less compile, on either Python 2.5 or Python 2.6</p>
