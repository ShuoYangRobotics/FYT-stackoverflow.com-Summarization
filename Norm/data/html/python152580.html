<h3>Question (ID-152580):</h3><h2>What's the canonical way to check for type in python?</h2><p>What is the best way to check if a given object is of a given type. How about checking if the object inherits from a given type.</p>

<p>Let's say I have an object <code>o</code>. How do I check if it's an <code>str</code>?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>To check if the type of o is exactly str:</p>

<pre>type(o) is str</pre>

To check if o is an instance of str or any subclass of str (this would be the "canonical" way):

<pre>isinstance(o, str)</pre>

The following also work, and can be useful in some cases:

<pre>
issubclass(type(o), str)
type(o) in ([str] + str.__subclasses__())
</pre>

<p>See <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.3/lib/built-in-funcs.html" rel="nofollow">Built-in Functions</a> in the Python Library Reference for relevant information.</p>

<p>One more note: in this case, you may actually want to use</p>

<pre>isinstance(o, basestring)</pre>

<p>because this will also catch Unicode strings (unicode is not a subclass of str; both str and unicode are subclasses of basestring).</p>

<p>Alternatively, isinstance accepts a tuple of classes. This will return True if x is an instance of any subclass of any of (str, unicode):</p>

<pre>isinstance(o, (str, unicode))</pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The <strong>most</strong> Pythonic way to check the type of an object is... not to check it.</p>

<p>Since Python encourages <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing" rel="nofollow">Duck Typing</a>, you should just try to use the object's methods the way you want to use them.  So if you're function is looking for a writable file object, <em>don't</em> check that it's a subclass of <code>file</code>, just try to use its <code>.write()</code> method!</p>

<p>Of course, sometimes these nice abstractions break down and <code>isinstance(obj, cls)</code> is what you need.  But use sparingly.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I'm going to be a complete karma whore and post an answer because I just remembered it.</p>

<p><code>isinstance(o, str)</code> will return <code>true</code> if <code>o</code> is an <code>str</code> or is of a type that inherits from <code>str</code>.</p>

<p><code>type(o) == str</code> will return <code>true</code> if and only if <code>o</code> is a str. It will return <code>false</code> if <code>o</code> is of a type that inherits from <code>str</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I think the cool thing about using a dynamic language like python is you really shouldn't have to check something like that.</p>

<p>I would just call the required methods on your object and catch an <code>AttributeError</code>. Later on this will allow you to call your methods with other (seemingly unrelated) objects to accomplish different tasks, such as mocking an object for testing.</p>

<p>I've used this alot when getting data off the web with <code>urllib2.urlopen()</code> which returns a <em>file like</em> object. This can in turn can be passed to almost any method that reads from a file, because is implements the same <code>read()</code> method as a real file.</p>

<p>But I'm sure there is a time and place for using <code>isinstance()</code>, otherwise it probably wouldn't be there :)</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><pre><code>isinstance(o, str)
</code></pre>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Sorry to be the bad cop, but asking this question is admitting you're not making full use of an object oriented design.</p>
