<h3>Question (ID-1017621):</h3><h2>Why isn't Python very good for functional programming?</h2><p>I have always thought that functional programming can be done in Python. Thus, I was surprised that Python didn't get much of a mention in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1015606/mixing-object-oriented-and-functional-programming">this</a> question, and when it was mentioned, it normally wasn't very positive. However, not many reasons were given for this (lack of pattern matching and algebraic data types were mentioned). So my question is: why isn't Python very good for functional programming? Are there more reasons than its lack of pattern matching and algebraic data types? Or are these concepts so important to functional programming that a language that doesn't support them can only be classed as a second rate functional programming language? (Keep in mind that my experience with functional programming is quite limited.)</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The question you reference asks which languages promote both OO and functional programming. Python does not <em>promote</em> functional programming even though it <em>works</em> fairly well.</p>

<p>The best argument <em>against</em> functional programming in Python is that imperative/OO use cases are carefully considered by Guido, while functional programming use cases are not. When I write imperative Python, it's one of the prettiest languages I know. When I write functional Python, it becomes as ugly and unpleasant as your average language that doesn't have a BDFL.</p>

<p>Which is not to say that it's bad, just that you have to work harder than you would if you switched to a language that promotes functional programming or switched to writing OO Python.</p>

<p>Here are the functional things I miss in Python:</p>

<li>Lazy lists</li>
<li>Simple, powerful expression syntax (Python's simple block syntax prevents Guido from adding it)</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<ul>
<li>No pattern matching and no tail recursion mean your basic algorithms have to be written imperatively. Recursion is ugly and slow in Python.</li>
<li>A small list library and no functional dictionaries mean that you have to write a lot of stuff yourself. </li>
<li>No syntax for currying or composition means that point-free style is about as full of punctuation as explicitly passing arguments.</li>
<li>Iterators instead of lazy lists means that you have to know whether you want efficiency or persistence, and to scatter calls to <code>list</code> around if you want persistence. (Iterators are use-once)</li>
<li>Python's simple imperative syntax, along with its simple LL1 parser, mean that a better syntax for if-expressions and lambda-expressions is basically impossible. Guido likes it this way, and I think he's right.</li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Guido has a good explanation of this <a href="http://python-history.blogspot.com/2009/04/origins-of-pythons-functional-features.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  Here's the most relevant part:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have never considered Python to be
  heavily influenced by functional
  languages, no matter what people say
  or think. I was much more familiar
  with imperative languages such as C
  and Algol 68 and although I had made
  functions first-class objects, I
  didn't view Python as a functional
  programming language. However, earlier
  on, it was clear that users wanted to
  do much more with lists and functions.</p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>It is also worth nothing that even
  though I didn't envision Python as a
  functional language, the introduction
  of closures has been useful in the
  development of many other advanced
  programming features. For example,
  certain aspects of new-style classes,
  decorators, and other modern features
  rely upon this capability.</p>
  
  <p>Lastly, even though a number of
  functional programming features have
  been introduced over the years, Python
  still lacks certain features found in
  “real” functional programming
  languages. For instance, Python does
  not perform certain kinds of
  optimizations (e.g., tail recursion).
  In general, because Python's extremely
  dynamic nature, it is impossible to do
  the kind of compile-time optimization
  known from functional languages like
  Haskell or ML. And that's fine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I pull two things out of this:</p>

<ol>
<li>The language's creator doesn't really consider Python to be a functional language.  Therefore, it's possible to see "functional-esque" features, but you're unlikely to see anything that is definitively functional.</li>
<li>Python's dynamic nature inhibits some of the optimizations you see in other functional languages.  Granted, Lisp is just as dynamic (if not more dynamic) as Python, so this is only a partial explanation.</li>
</ol>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Scheme doesn't have algebraic data types or pattern matching but it's certainly a functional language. Annoying things about Python from a functional programming perspective:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Crippled Lambdas. Since Lambdas can only contain an expression, and you can't do everything as easily in an expression context, this means that the functions you can define "on the fly" are limited.</p></li>
<li><p>Ifs are statements, not expressions. This means, among other things, you can't have a lambda with an If inside it. (This is fixed by ternaries in Python 2.5, but it looks ugly.)</p></li>
<li><p>Guido threatens to <a href="http://xahlee.org/perl-python/python_3000.html" rel="nofollow">remove map, filter, and reduce</a> every once in awhile</p></li>
</ol>

<p>On the other hand, python has lexical closures, Lambdas, and list comprehensions (which are really a "functional" concept whether or not Guido admits it). I do plenty of "functional-style" programming in Python, but I'd hardly say it's ideal.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I would never call Python “functional” but whenever I program in Python the code invariably ends up being almost purely functional.</p>

<p>Admittedly, that's mainly due to the extremely nice list comprehension. So I wouldn't necessarily suggest Python as a functional programming language but I would suggest functional programming for anyone using Python.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Python is almost a functional language.  It's "functional lite".  </p>

<p>It has extra features, so it isn't pure enough for some.  </p>

<p>It also lacks some features, so it isn't complete enough for some.  </p>

<p>The missing features are relatively easy to write.  Check out posts like <a href="http://blog.sigfpe.com/2008/02/purely-functional-recursive-types-in.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> on FP in Python.</p>

<p>Check the answers to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/779800/a-gentler-introduction-to-functional-programming">this</a> question on functional programming languages.  The comments are more informative than my lame answer.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Let me demonstrate with a piece of code taken from an answer to a "functional" <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1016997/generate-from-generators/1017105#1017105">Python question</a> on SO</p>

<p>Python:</p>

<pre><code>def grandKids(generation, kidsFunc, val):
  layer = [val]
  for i in xrange(generation):
    layer = concat(itertools.imap(kidsFunc, layer))
  return layer

def concat(xs):
  for x in xs:
    for val in x:
      yield val
</code></pre>

<p>Haskell:</p>

<pre><code>grandKids generation kidsFunc val =
  iterate (concatMap kidsFunc) [val] !! generation
</code></pre>

<p>The main difference here is that Haskell's standard library has useful functions for functional programming: in this case <code>iterate</code>, <code>concat</code>, and <code>(!!)</code></p>
