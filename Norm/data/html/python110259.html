<h3>Question (ID-110259):</h3><h2>Python memory profiler</h2><p>I want to know the memory usage of my Python application and specifically want to know what code blocks/portions or objects are consuming most memory.
Google search shows a commercial one is <a href="http://www.softwareverify.com/python/memory/index.html" rel="nofollow">Python Memory Validator</a>.</p>

<p>And open source ones are <a href="http://pysizer.8325.org/" rel="nofollow">PySizer</a> and <a href="http://guppy-pe.sourceforge.net/#Heapy" rel="nofollow">Heapy</a>.</p>

<p>I haven't tried anyone, so I wanted to know which one is the best considering:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Gives most details.</p></li>
<li><p>I have to do least or no changes to my code.</p></li>
</ol>

<pre><code>from guppy import hpy
h = hpy()
print h.heap()
</code></pre>

<p>This gives you some output like this:</p>

<pre><code>Partition of a set of 132527 objects. Total size = 8301532 bytes.
Index  Count   %     Size   % Cumulative  % Kind (class / dict of class)
0  35144  27  2140412  26   2140412  26 str
1  38397  29  1309020  16   3449432  42 tuple
2    530   0   739856   9   4189288  50 dict (no owner)
</code></pre>

<p>You can also find out from where objects are referenced and get statistics about that, but somehow the docs on that are a bit sparse.</p>

<p>There is a graphical browser as well, written in Tk.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I recommend <a href="http://www.aminus.net/wiki/Dowser" rel="nofollow">Dowser</a>. It is very easy to setup, and you need zero changes to your code. You can view counts of objects of each type through time, view list of live objects, view references to live objects, all from the simple web interface.</p>

<pre><code># memdebug.py

import cherrypy
import dowser

def start(port):
    cherrypy.tree.mount(dowser.Root())
    cherrypy.config.update({
        'environment': 'embedded',
        'server.socket_port': port
    })
    cherrypy.server.quickstart()
    cherrypy.engine.start(blocking=False)
</code></pre>

<p>You import memdebug, and call memdebug.start. That's all.</p>

<p>I haven't tried PySizer or Heapy. I would appreciate others' reviews.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Consider the <A HREF="http://mg.pov.lt/objgraph/" rel="nofollow">objgraph</A> library (see <A HREF="http://www.lshift.net/blog/2008/11/14/tracing-python-memory-leaks" rel="nofollow">http://www.lshift.net/blog/2008/11/14/tracing-python-memory-leaks</A> for an example use case).</p>
