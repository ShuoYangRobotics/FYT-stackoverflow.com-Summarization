<h3>Question (ID-765396):</h3><h2>Exif manipulation library for python</h2><p>I'm looking for good exif (Exchangeable image file format) manipulation library for python. I prefer flexibility (e.g., ability to retrieve providers' proprietary tags) than processing speed. What would you suggest? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-9):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I've been using <a href="http://tilloy.net/dev/pyexiv2/" rel="nofollow">pyexiv2</a> myself recently, and it seems to fit my needs quite nicely. Perhaps it might suit yours as well.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You might want to check out <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/exif-py" rel="nofollow">EXIF-py</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Python library to extract EXIF data from tiff and jpeg files. Very easy to use - $ ./EXIF.py image.jpg</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or the <a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/" rel="nofollow">Python Imaging Library (PIL)</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Python Imaging Library (PIL) adds image processing capabilities to your Python interpreter. This library supports many file formats, and provides powerful image processing and graphics capabilities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's also the aptly named pyexif: <a href="http://pyexif.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">http://pyexif.sourceforge.net/</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The pyexif python library and tools aims at extracting EXIF information from Jpeg and Tiff files which include it. This information is typically included in images created using digital imaging devices such as digital cameras, digital film scanners, etc. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, it looks like pyexif hasn't been updated in quite while. They recommend if theirs isn't doing the trick to check out EXIF-py, so you should probably try that one first, as their sourceforge page seems to have <em>some</em> activity there lately, though not much. Finally,  using PIL you could do this:</p>

<pre><code>from PIL import Image
from PIL.ExifTags import TAGS

def get_exif(fn):
    ret = {}
    i = Image.open(fn)
    info = i._getexif()
    for tag, value in info.items():
        decoded = TAGS.get(tag, tag)
        ret[decoded] = value
    return ret
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>:<br />
I actually have no idea which is best, this is just what I was able to piece together with Google. :)</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>A new answer to an old post. pyexiv2 is the best library available for python and has been so for a few years now. It is a wrapper around the mature exiv2 project, supports reading and writing to many image types (JPEG, PNG, TIFF and many raw formats), understands standard (Xmp, IPTC and Exif) and non-standard metadata ("Makernotes"), and runs on multiple platforms (Windows, Linux, and, with some work, Mac).</p>

<p>Check out the tutorial to be up and running in 5 minutes or less</p>

<p>exiv2: <a href="http://exiv2.org/" rel="nofollow">http://exiv2.org/</a></p>

<p>Both projects are open source.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You might also look at Gheorghe Milas' jpeg.py library at <a href="http://www.emilas.com/jpeg/" rel="nofollow">http://www.emilas.com/jpeg/</a>, which is "A python library to parse, read and write JPEG EXIF, IPTC and COM metadata." </p>

<p>A drawback is that he appears to be hosting his domain on a dynamic IP via DynDNS, so it's not always available.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.fetidcascade.com/pyexif.html" rel="nofollow">This article</a> describes a Python module for writing EXIF metadata (and not just reading them) using pure Python. Apparently, none of PIL, pyexif, nor EXIF-py support writing EXIF. pyexiv2 appears to be bleeding-edge and platform-specific.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>There are some examples of PIL and EXIF.py usage on <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/tags/EXIF/" rel="nofollow">ASPN</a></p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I started to write my own small library which is based on the code in PIL.</p>

<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>In Python 2.6 the place of module is different. Use this:</p>

<pre><code>import Image    
from ExifTags import TAGS
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>somehow i get an attributeError for _getexif with Paolo's code above.. I am using Python 2.6.6 and PIL 1.1.7.  Is _getexif obsolete now??</p>

<p>Here's a small modification that worked for me.</p>

<pre><code>from PIL import Image
from PIL.ExifTags import TAGS

def get_exif(fn):
    ret = {}
    i = Image.open(fn)
#    info = i._getexif()
    info = i.tag.tags
    for tag, value in info.items():
        decoded = TAGS.get(tag, tag)
        ret[decoded] = value
    return ret
</code></pre>
