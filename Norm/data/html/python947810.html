<h3>Question (ID-947810):</h3><h2>How to save a Python interactive session?</h2><p>I find myself frequently using Python's interpreter to work with databases, files, etc -- basically a lot of manual formatting of semi-structured data.  I don't properly save and clean up the useful bits as often as I would like.  Is there a way to save my input into the shell (db connections, variable assignments, little for loops and bits of logic) -- some history of the interactive session?  If I use something like <code>script</code> I get too much stdout noise.  I don't really need to pickle all the objects -- though if there is a solution that does that, it would be OK.  Ideally I would just be left with a script that ran as the one I created interactively, and I could just delete the bits I didn't need.  Is there a package that does this, or a DIY approach?</p>

<p><b>UPDATE</b>:  I am really amazed at the quality and usefulness of these packages.  For those with a similar itch:</p>

<ul>
<li>IPython -- should have been using this for ages, kind of what I had in mind</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.fishsoup.net/category/coding/reinteract/" rel="nofollow">reinteract</a> -- very impressive, I want to learn more about visualization and this seems like it will shine there.  Sort of a gtk/gnome desktop app that renders graphs inline.  Imagine a hybrid shell + graphing calculator + mini eclipse.  Source distribution here: <a href="http://www.reinteract.org/trac/wiki/GettingIt" rel="nofollow">http://www.reinteract.org/trac/wiki/GettingIt</a> . Built fine on Ubuntu, integrates into gnome desktop, Windows and Mac installers too.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.noiseforfree.com/bpython/download.html" rel="nofollow">bpython</a> -- extremely cool, lots of nice features, autocomplete(!), rewind, one keystroke save to file, indentation, well done.  Python source distribution, pulled a couple of dependencies from sourceforge.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am converted, these really fill a need between interpreter and editor.</p>

For example for your usecase there is the <em>save</em> command, you just input <em>save my_useful_session 10-20 23</em> to save input lines 10 to 20 and 23 to my_useful_session.py. (to help with this, every line is prefixed by its number)</p>

<p>Look at the videos on the documentation page to get a quick overview of the features.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>There is a <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/interactive.html?highlight=atexit" rel="nofollow">way</a> to do it. Store the file in ~/.pystartup</p>

<pre><code># Add auto-completion and a stored history file of commands to your Python
# interactive interpreter. Requires Python 2.0+, readline. Autocomplete is
# bound to the Esc key by default (you can change it - see readline docs).
#
# Store the file in ~/.pystartup, and set an environment variable to point
# to it:  "export PYTHONSTARTUP=/home/user/.pystartup" in bash.
#
# Note that PYTHONSTARTUP does *not* expand "~", so you have to put in the
# full path to your home directory.

import atexit
import os
import readline
import rlcompleter

historyPath = os.path.expanduser("~/.pyhistory")

def save_history(historyPath=historyPath):
    import readline
    readline.write_history_file(historyPath)

if os.path.exists(historyPath):
    readline.read_history_file(historyPath)

atexit.register(save_history)
del os, atexit, readline, rlcompleter, save_history, historyPath
</code></pre>

<p>You can also add this to get autocomplete for free:</p>

<pre><code>readline.parse_and_bind('tab: complete')
</code></pre>

<p>Please note that this will only work on *nix systems. As readline is only available in Unix platform.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Also, <a href="http://blog.fishsoup.net/2007/11/10/reinteract-better-interactive-python/">reinteract</a> gives you a notebook-like interface to a Python session.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>In addition to IPython, a similar utility <a href="http://www.noiseforfree.com/bpython/index.html" rel="nofollow">bpython</a> has a "save the code you've entered to a file" feature</p>
