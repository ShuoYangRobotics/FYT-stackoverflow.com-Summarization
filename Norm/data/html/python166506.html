<h3>Question (ID-166506):</h3><h2>Finding local IP addresses using Python's stdlib</h2><p>How can I find the local IP address (i.e. 192.168.x.x or 10.0.x.x) in Python platform independently and using only the standard library?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-11):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><pre><code>import socket
socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname())
</code></pre>

<p>This won't work always (returns 127.0.0.1 on machines having the hostname in /etc/hosts as 127.0.0.1), a paliative would be what gimel shows, use socket.getfqdn() instead. Of course your machine needs a resolvable hostname.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I just found this but it seems a bit hackish, however they say tried it on *nix and I did on windows and it worked.</p>

<pre><code>s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
s.connect(("gmail.com",80))
print s.getsockname()
</code></pre>

<p>This assumes you have an internet access, and that there is no local proxy.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><pre><code>import socket
print([ip for ip in socket.gethostbyname_ex(socket.gethostname())[2] if not ip.startswith("127.")][0])
</code></pre>

<p>I'm using this, because one of the computers I was on had an /etc/hosts with duplicate entries and references to itself. socket.gethostbyname() only returns the last entry in /etc/hosts. This solution weeds out the ones starting with "127.". 
Works with Python 3 and 2.5, possibly other versions too. Does not deal with several network devices or IPv6. Works on Linux and Windows.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You can use the <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/netifaces/0.4" rel="nofollow">netifaces</a> module. Just type:</p>

<pre><code>easy_install netifaces
</code></pre>

<p>in your command shell and it will install itself on default Python installation.</p>

<p>Then you can use it like this:</p>

<pre><code>from netifaces import interfaces, ifaddresses, AF_INET
for ifaceName in interfaces():
    addresses = [i['addr'] for i in ifaddresses(ifaceName).setdefault(AF_INET, [{'addr':'No IP addr'}] )]
    print '%s: %s' % (ifaceName, ', '.join(addresses))
</code></pre>

<p>On my computer it printed:</p>

<pre>{45639BDC-1050-46E0-9BE9-075C30DE1FBC}: 192.168.0.100
{D43A468B-F3AE-4BF9-9391-4863A4500583}: 10.5.9.207</pre>

<p>Author of this module claims it should work on Windows, UNIX and Mac OS X.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>If you don't want to use external packages and don't want to rely on outside Internet servers, this might help. It's a code sample that I found on <a href="http://www.google.com/codesearch?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=getMACAddrWin&amp;sbtn=Search" rel="nofollow">Google Code Search</a> and modified to return required information:</p>

<pre><code>def getIPAddresses():

                    yield ipAddr
                adNode = adNode.next
                if not adNode:
                    break
</code></pre>

<p>Usage:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; for addr in getIPAddresses():
&gt;&gt;&gt;    print addr
192.168.0.100
10.5.9.207
</code></pre>

<p>As it relies on <code>windll</code>, this will work only on Windows.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I'm afraid there aren't any good platform independent ways to do this other than connecting to another computer and having it send you your IP address.  For example:  <a href="http://www.findmyipaddress.info/locateipaddresses.html" rel="nofollow">findmyipaddress</a>.  Note that this won't work if you need an IP address that's behind NAT unless the computer you're connecting to is behind NAT as well.</p>

<p>Here's one solution that works in Linux:  <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/439094/" rel="nofollow">get the IP address associated with a network interface</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I use this on my ubuntu machines:</p>

<pre><code>import commands
commands.getoutput("ifconfig").split("\n")[1].split()[1][5:]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>im using following module:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python

# module for getting the lan ip address of the computer

import os

import socket

if os.name != "nt":

    import fcntl

    import struct

    def get_interface_ip(ifname):

    	s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)

    	return socket.inet_ntoa(fcntl.ioctl(

    			s.fileno(),

    			0x8915,  # SIOCGIFADDR

    			struct.pack('256s', ifname[:15])

    		)[20:24])



def get_lan_ip():

    ip = socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname())

    if ip.startswith("127.") and os.name != "nt":

    	interfaces = ["eth0","eth1","eth2","wlan0","wlan1","wifi0","ath0","ath1","ppp0"]

    	for ifname in interfaces:

    		try:

    			ip = get_interface_ip(ifname)

    			break;

    		except IOError:

    			pass

    return ip
</code></pre>

<p>Tested with windows and linux (and doesnt require additional modules for those)
intended for use on systems which are in a single LAN.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>FYI I can verify that the method:</p>

<pre><code>import socket
addr = socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname())
</code></pre>

<p>Works in OS X (10.6,10.5), Windows XP, and on a well administered RHEL department server.  It did not work on a very minimal CentOS VM that I just do some kernel hacking on.  So for that instance you can just check for a 127.0.0.1 address and in that case do the following:</p>

<pre><code>if addr == "127.0.0.1":
     import commands
     output = commands.getoutput("/sbin/ifconfig")
     addr = parseaddress(output)
</code></pre>

<p>And then parse the ip address from the output.  It should be noted that ifconfig is not in a normal user's PATH by default and that is why I give the full path in the command.  I hope this helps.</p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>one simple way to produce "clean" output via command line utils</p>

<p>import commands</p>

<p>ips = commands.getoutput("/sbin/ifconfig | grep -i \"inet\" | grep -iv \"inet6\" | awk {'print $2'} | sed -ne 's/adr\:/ /p'")
print ips</p>

<p>it will show all ipv4 address on system ;)</p>
<br /><b>#10</b><br /><p>For a list of IP addresses on *nix systems,</p>

<pre><code>import subprocess
co = subprocess.Popen(['ifconfig'], stdout = subprocess.PIPE)
ifconfig = co.stdout.read()
ip_regex = re.compile('((25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.(25[0-4]|2[0-5][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?))')
[match[0] for match in ip_regex.findall(ifconfig, re.MULTILINE)]
</code></pre>

<p>Though it's a bit late for this answer, I thought someone else may find it useful :-)</p>

<p>PS : It'll return Broadcast addresses and Netmask as well.</p>
