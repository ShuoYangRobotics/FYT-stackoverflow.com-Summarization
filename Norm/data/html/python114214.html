<h3>Question (ID-114214):</h3><h2>Class method differences in Python: bound, unbound and static</h2><p>What is the difference between the following class methods?</p>

<p>Is it that one is static and the other is not?</p>

<pre><code>class Test(object):
  def method_one(self):
    print "Called method_one"

  def method_two():
    print "Called method_two"

a_test = Test()
a_test.method_one()
a_test.method_two()
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>In Python, there is a distinction between <em>bound</em> and <em>unbound</em> methods. </p>

<p>Basically, a call to a member function (like <code>method_one</code>), a bound function</p>

<pre><code>a_test.method_one()
</code></pre>

<p>is translated to</p>

<pre><code>Test.method_one(a_test)
</code></pre>

<p>i.e. a call to an unbound method. Because of that, a call to your version of <code>method_two</code> will fail with a <code>TypeError</code></p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a_test = Test() 
&gt;&gt;&gt; a_test.method_two()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: method_two() takes no arguments (1 given)
</code></pre>

<p>You can change the behavior of a method using a decorator</p>

<pre><code>class Test(object):
    def method_one(self):
        print "Called method_one"

    @staticmethod
    def method_two():
        print "Called method two"
</code></pre>

<p>The decorator tells the built-in default metaclass <code>type</code> (the class of a class, cf. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/100003/what-is-a-metaclass-in-python">this question</a>) to not create bound methods for <code>method_two</code>.</p>

<p>Now, you can invoke static method both on an instance or on the class directly:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a_test = Test()
&gt;&gt;&gt; a_test.method_one()
Called method_one
&gt;&gt;&gt; a_test.method_two()
Called method_two
&gt;&gt;&gt; Test.method_two()
Called method_two
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Methods in Python are a very, very simple thing once you understood the basics of the descriptor system.  Imagine the following class:</p>

<pre><code>class C(object):
    def foo(self):
        pass
</code></pre>

<p>Now let's have a look at that class in the shell:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; C.foo
&lt;unbound method C.foo&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; C.__dict__['foo']
&lt;function foo at 0x17d05b0&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see if you access the <code>foo</code> attribute on the class you get back an unbound method, however inside the class storage (the dict) there is a function.  Why's that?  The reason for this is that the class of your class implements a <code>__getattribute__</code> that resolves descriptors.  Sounds complex, but is not.  <code>C.foo</code> is roughly equivalent to this code in that special case:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; C.__dict__['foo'].__get__(None, C)
&lt;unbound method C.foo&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That's because functions have a <code>__get__</code> method which makes them descriptors.  If you have an instance of a class it's nearly the same, just that <code>None</code> is the class instance:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; c = C()
&gt;&gt;&gt; C.__dict__['foo'].__get__(c, C)
&lt;bound method C.foo of &lt;__main__.C object at 0x17bd4d0&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now why does Python do that?  Because the method object binds the first parameter of a function to the instance of the class.  That's where self comes from.  Now sometimes you don't want your class to make a function a method, that's where <code>staticmethod</code> comes into play:</p>

<pre><code> class C(object):
  @staticmethod
  def foo():
   pass
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>staticmethod</code> decorator wraps your class and implements a dummy <code>__get__</code> that returns the wrapped function as function and not as a method:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; C.__dict__['foo'].__get__(None, C)
&lt;function foo at 0x17d0c30&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Hope that explains it.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>When you call a class member, Python automatically uses a reference to the object as the first parameter. The variable <code>self</code> actually means nothing, it's just a coding convention. You could call it <code>gargaloo</code> if you wanted. That said, the call to <code>method_two</code> would raise a <code>TypeError</code>, because Python is automatically trying to pass a parameter (the reference to its parent object) to a method that was defined as having no parameters.</p>

<p>To actually make it work, you could append this to your class definition:</p>

<pre><code>method_two = staticmethod(method_two)
</code></pre>

<p>or you could use the <code>@staticmethod</code> <a href="http://docs.python.org/ref/function.html" rel="nofollow">function decorator</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>method_two won't work because you're defining a member function but not telling it what the function is a member of. If you execute the last line you'll get:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a_test.method_two()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: method_two() takes no arguments (1 given)
</code></pre>

<p>If you're defining member functions for a class the first argument must always be 'self'.</p>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>The call to method_two will throw an exception for not accepting the self parameter the Python runtime will automatically pass it.</p>

<p>If you want to create a static method in a Python class, decorate it with the <code>staticmethod decorator</code>.</p>

<pre><code>Class Test(Object):
  @staticmethod
  def method_two():
    print "Called method_two"

Test.method_two()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>that is an error.</p>

<p>first of all, first line should be like this (be careful of capitals)</p>

<pre><code>class Test(object):
</code></pre>

<p>Whenever you call a method of a class, it gets itself as the first argument (hence the name self) and method_two gives this error </p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a.method_two()
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: method_two() takes no arguments (1 given)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>The second one won't work because when you call it like that python internally tries to call it with the a_test instance as the first argument, but your method_two doesn't accept any arguments, so it wont work, you'll get a runtime error.
If you want the equivalent of a static method you can use a class method.
There's much less need for class methods in Python than static methods in languages like Java or C#. Most often the best solution is to use a method in the module, outside a class definition, those work more efficiently than class methods.</p>
