<p>Another resource is by example at the <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/langs/python/" rel="nofollow">Python Recipes</a>.  A good number do not follow best practices but you can find some patterns in there that are useful</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Type</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import this
</code></pre>

<p>in a Python console.</p>

<p>Although this is usually treated as a (fine!) joke, it contains a couple of valid python-specific axioms.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Bruce Eckel's "<a href="http://www.mindview.net/Books/TIPython" rel="nofollow">Thinking in Python</a>" leans heavily on Design Patterns </p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You can get started <a href="http://www.python.org/workshops/1997-10/proceedings/savikko.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.suttoncourtenay.org.uk/duncan/accu/pythonpatterns.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  </p>

<p>For a more in depth look at design pattners you should look at <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0201633612" rel="nofollow">Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</a>.  The source code is not in Python, but it doesn't need to be for you to understand the patterns. </p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Good <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vJJlVBVTFg" rel="nofollow">video</a> on the subject.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You may also wish to read this <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/gregs/ref-dyn-patterns.html" rel="nofollow">article</a> (select the .pdf file), which discusses Design Patterns in dynamic object oriented languages (i.e. Python). To quote the page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This paper explores how the patterns from the "Gang of Four", or "GOF" book, as it is often called, appear when similar problems are addressed using a dynamic, higher-order, object-oriented programming language. Some of the patterns disappear -- that is, they are supported directly by language features, some patterns are simpler or have a different focus, and some are essentially unchanged. </p>

<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Something you can use to simplify your code when calling attributes on objects that might or might not exist is to use the <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/68205-null-object-design-pattern/" rel="nofollow">Null Object Design Pattern</a> (to which I was introduced in <a href="http://books.google.com.ar/books?id=Q0s6Vgb98CQC&amp;pg=PT311&amp;lpg=PT311&amp;dq=Null+object+python+cookbook&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hc3368UkpC&amp;sig=qRrDqvZwg4FIoMuKo3JJhI7Bu_g&amp;hl=es&amp;ei=TiqpS5jZEMuVtgf08YGnAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false" rel="nofollow">Python Cookbook</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Roughly, the goal with Null objects is to provide an 'intelligent'
  replacement for the often used primitive data type None in Python or
  Null (or Null pointers) in other languages. These are used for many
  purposes including the important case where one member of some group 
  of otherwise similar elements is special for whatever reason. Most 
  often this results in conditional statements to distinguish between
  ordinary elements and the primitive Null value.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This object just eats the lack of attribute error, and you can avoid checking for their existence.</p>

<p>It's nothing more than</p>

<pre><code>class Null(object):

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        "Ignore parameters."
        return None

    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        "Ignore method calls."
        return self

    def __getattr__(self, mname):
        "Ignore attribute requests."
        return self

    def __setattr__(self, name, value):
        "Ignore attribute setting."
        return self

    def __delattr__(self, name):
        "Ignore deleting attributes."
        return self

    def __repr__(self):
        "Return a string representation."
        return "&lt;Null&gt;"

    def __str__(self):
        "Convert to a string and return it."
        return "Null"
</code></pre>

<p>With this, if you do <code>Null("any", "params", "you", "want").attribute_that_doesnt_exists()</code> it won't explode, but just silently become the equivalent of <code>pass</code>.</p>

<p>Normally you'd do something like</p>

<pre><code>if obj.attr:
    obj.attr()
</code></pre>

<p>With this, you just do:</p>

<pre><code>obj.attr()
</code></pre>

<p>and forget about it. Beware that extensive use of the <code>Null</code> object can potentially hide bugs in your code.</p>
