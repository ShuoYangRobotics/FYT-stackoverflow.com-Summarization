<h3>Question (ID-895371):</h3><h2>Bubble Sort Homework</h2><p>In class we are doing sorting algorithms and, although I understand them fine when talking about them and writing pseudocode, I am having problems writing actual code for them.</p>

<p>This is my attempt in Python:</p>

<pre><code>mylist = [12, 5, 13, 8, 9, 65]

def bubble(badList):
    length = len(badList) - 1
    unsorted = True

    while unsorted:
    	for element in range(0,length):
		    unsorted = False
		    if badList[element] &gt; badList[element + 1]:
			    hold = badList[element + 1]
			    badList[element + 1] = badList[element]
			    badList[element] = hold
			    print badList
		    else:
			    unsorted = True

print bubble(mylist)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, this (as far as I can tell) sorts correctly, but once it finishes it just loops indefinitely.</p>

<p>How can this code be fixed so the function finishes properly and correctly sorts a list of any (reasonable) size?</p>

<p>P.S. I know I should not really have prints in a function and I should have a return, but I just have not done that yet as my code does not really work yet.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>To explain why your script isn't working right now, I'll rename the variable <code>unsorted</code> to <code>sorted</code>.</p>

<p>At first, your list isn't yet sorted. Of course, we set <code>sorted</code> to <code>False</code>.</p>

<p>As soon as we start the <code>while</code> loop, we assume that the list is already sorted. The idea is this: as soon as we find two elements that are not in the right order, we set <code>sorted</code> back to <code>False</code>. <code>sorted</code> will remain <code>True</code> <em>only if there were no elements in the wrong order</em>.</p>

<pre><code>sorted = False  # We haven't started sorting yet

while not sorted:
    sorted = True  # Assume the list is now sorted
    for element in range(0, length):
        if badList[element] &gt; badList[element + 1]:
            sorted = False  # We found two elements in the wrong order
            hold = badList[element + 1]
            badList[element + 1] = badList[element]
            badList[element] = hold
    # We went through the whole list. At this point, if there were no elements
    # in the wrong order, sorted is still True. Otherwise, it's false, and the
    # while loop executes again.
</code></pre>

<p>There are also minor little issues that would help the code be more efficient or readable.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In the <code>for</code> loop, you use the variable <code>element</code>. Technically, <code>element</code> is not an element; it's a number representing a list index. Also, it's quite long. In these cases, just use a temporary variable name, like <code>i</code> for "index".</p>

<pre><code>for i in range(0, length):
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>The <code>range</code> command can also take just one argument (named <code>stop</code>). In that case, you get a list of all the integers from 0 to that argument.</p>

<pre><code>for i in range(length):
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>The <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow" title="Style Guide for Python Code">Python Style Guide</a> recommends that variables be named in lowercase with underscores. This is a very minor nitpick for a little script like this; it's more to get you accustomed to what Python code most often resembles.</p>

<pre><code>def bubble(bad_list):
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>To swap the values of two variables, write them as a tuple assignment. The right hand side gets evaluated as a tuple (say, <code>(badList[i+1], badList[i])</code> is <code>(3, 5)</code>) and then gets assigned to the two variables on the left hand side (<code>(badList[i], badList[i+1])</code>).</p>

<pre><code>bad_list[i], bad_list[i+1] = bad_list[i+1], bad_list[i]
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>Put it all together, and you get this:</p>

<pre><code>my_list = [12, 5, 13, 8, 9, 65]

def bubble(bad_list):
    length = len(bad_list) - 1
    sorted = False

    while not sorted:
        sorted = True
        for i in range(length):
            if bad_list[i] &gt; bad_list[i+1]:
                sorted = False
                bad_list[i], bad_list[i+1] = bad_list[i+1], bad_list[i]

bubble(my_list)
print my_list
</code></pre>

<p>(I removed your print statement too, by the way.)</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The goal of bubble sort is to move the <em>heavier</em> items at the bottom in each round, while moving the <em>lighter</em> items up. In the inner loop, where you compare the elements, <strong>you don't have to iterate the whole list in each turn</strong>. The <em>heaviest</em> is already placed last. The <em>swapped</em> variable is an extra check so we can mark that the list is now sorted and avoid continuing with unnecessary calculations.</p>

<pre><code>def bubble(badList):
    length = len(badList)
    for i in range(0,length):
        swapped = False
        for element in range(0, length-i-1):
            if badList[element] &gt; badList[element + 1]:
                hold = badList[element + 1]
                badList[element + 1] = badList[element]
                badList[element] = hold
                swapped = True
        if not swapped: break

    return badList
</code></pre>

<p>Your version 1, corrected:</p>

<pre><code>def bubble(badList):
    length = len(badList) - 1
    unsorted = True
    while unsorted:
        unsorted = False
        for element in range(0,length):
            #unsorted = False
            if badList[element] &gt; badList[element + 1]:
                 hold = badList[element + 1]
                 badList[element + 1] = badList[element]
                 badList[element] = hold
                 unsorted = True
                 #print badList
             #else:
                 #unsorted = True

     return badList
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>This is what happens when you use variable name of negative meaning, you need to invert their values.  The following would be easier to understand:</p>

<pre><code>sorted = False
while not sorted:
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>On the other hand, the logic of the algorithm is a little bit off.  You need to check whether two elements swapped during the for loop.  Here's how I would write it:</p>

<pre><code>def bubble(values):
    length = len(values) - 1
    sorted = False
    while not sorted:
        sorted = True
        for element in range(0,length):
            if values[element] &gt; values[element + 1]:
                 hold = values[element + 1]
                 values[element + 1] = values[element]
                 values[element] = hold
                 sorted = False
    return values
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Your use of the Unsorted variable is wrong; you want to have a variable that tells you if you have swapped two elements; if you have done that, you can exit your loop, otherwise, you need to loop again.  To fix what you've got here, just put the "unsorted = false" in the body of your if case; remove your else case; and put "unsorted = true before your <code>for</code> loop.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You've got a couple of errors in there. The first is in length, and the second is in your use of unsorted (as stated by McWafflestix). You probably also want to return the list if you're going to print it:</p>

<pre><code>mylist = [12, 5, 13, 8, 9, 65]

def bubble(badList):
    length = len(badList) - 2
    unsorted = True

    while unsorted:
        for element in range(0,length):
            unsorted = False

            if badList[element] &gt; badList[element + 1]:
                hold = badList[element + 1]
                badList[element + 1] = badList[element]
                badList[element] = hold
                print badList
                unsorted = True

    return badList

print bubble(mylist)
</code></pre>

<p>eta: You're right, the above is buggy as hell. My bad for not testing through some more examples.</p>

<pre><code>def bubble2(badList):
    swapped = True
    length = len(badList) - 2

    while swapped:
        swapped = False
        for i in range(0, length):
            if badList[i] &gt; badList[i + 1]:

                # swap
                hold = badList[i + 1]
                badList[i + 1] = badList[i]
                badList[i] = hold

                swapped = True

    return badList
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Answers provided by the-fury and Martin Cote fixed the problem of the infinite loop, but my code would still not work correctly (for a larger list, it would not sort correctly.). I ended up ditching the <code>unsorted</code> variable and used a counter instead.</p>

<pre><code>def bubble(badList):
    length = len(badList) - 1
    n = 0
    while n &lt; len(badList):
    	for element in range(0,length):
    		if badList[element] &gt; badList[element + 1]:
    			hold = badList[element + 1]
    			badList[element + 1] = badList[element]
    			badList[element] = hold
    			n = 0
    		else:
    			n += 1
    return badList

if __name__ == '__main__':
    mylist = [90, 10, 2, 76, 17, 66, 57, 23, 57, 99]
    print bubble(mylist)
</code></pre>

<p>If anyone could provide any pointers on how to improve my code in the comments, it would be much appreciated.</p>
