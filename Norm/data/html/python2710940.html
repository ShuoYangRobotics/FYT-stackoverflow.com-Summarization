<h3>Question (ID-2710940):</h3><h2>Python `if x is not None` or `if not x is None`?</h2><p>I've always thought of the <code>if not x is None</code> version to be more clear, but Google's <a href="http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html?showone=True/False_evaluations#True/False_evaluations" rel="nofollow">style guide</a> implies (based on this excerpt) that they use <code>if x is not None</code>. Is there any minor performance difference (I'm assuming not), and is there any case where one really doesn't fit (making the other a clear winner for my convention)?*</p>

<p>*I'm referring to any singleton, rather than just <code>None</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...to compare singletons like
  None. Use is  or is not.</p>

<pre><code>Python 2.6.2 (r262:71600, Apr 15 2009, 07:20:39)
&gt;&gt;&gt; import dis
&gt;&gt;&gt; def f(x):
...    return x is not None
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; dis.dis(f)
  2           0 LOAD_FAST                0 (x)
              3 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)
              6 COMPARE_OP               9 (is not)
              9 RETURN_VALUE

  2           0 LOAD_FAST                0 (x)
              3 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)

              9 RETURN_VALUE
</code></pre>

<p>Stylistically, I try to avoid <code>not x is y</code>.  Although the compiler will always treat it as <code>not (x is y)</code>, a human reader might misunderstand the construct as <code>(not x) is y</code>.  If I write <code>x is not y</code> then there is no ambiguity.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Code should be written to be understandable to the programmer first, and the compiler or interpreter second. The "is not" construct resembles English more closely than "not is".</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Both Google and Python's style guide is the best practice:</p>

<pre><code>if x is not None:
    # Do something about x
</code></pre>

<p>Using <code>not x</code> can cause unwanted results. See below:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; not x
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = [1]
&gt;&gt;&gt; not x
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; not x
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = [0]         # You don't want to fall in this one.
&gt;&gt;&gt; not x
False
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit for comment below:</strong> </p>

<p>I just did some more testing. <code>not x</code> is None doesn't negate <code>x</code> first and then compared to <code>None</code>. In fact, it seems the <code>is</code> operator has a higher precedence when used that way:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x
[0]
&gt;&gt;&gt; not x is None
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; not (x is None)
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; (not x) is None
False
</code></pre>

<p>Therefore, <code>not x is None</code> is just, in my honest opinion, best avoided.</p>

<p><strong>More edit:</strong></p>

<p>I just did <em>more</em> testing and can confirm that bukzor's comment is correct. (At least, I wasn't able to prove it otherwise.)</p>

<p>This means <code>if x is not None</code> has the exact result as <code>if not x is None</code>. I stand corrected. Thanks bukzor.</p>

<p>However, my answer still stands: <strong>Use the conventional <code>if x is not None</code></strong>. <code>:]</code></p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The <code>is not</code> operator is preferred over negating the result of <code>is</code> for stylistic reasons. "<code>if x is not None:</code>" reads just like English, but "<code>if not x is None:</code>" requires understanding of the operator precedence and does not read like english.</p>

<p>If there is a performance difference my money is on <code>is not</code>, but this almost certainly isn't the motivation for the decision to prefer that technique. It would obviously be implementation-dependent. Since <code>is</code> isn't overridable, it should be easy to optimise out any distinction anyhow.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>The answer is simpler than people are making it.</p>

<p>There's no technical advantage either way, and "x is not y" is what <em>everybody else uses</em>, which makes it the clear winner.  It doesn't matter that it "looks more like English" or not; everyone uses it, which means every user of Python--even Chinese users, whose language Python looks nothing like--will understand it at a glance, where the slightly less common syntax will take a couple extra brain cycles to parse.</p>

<p>Don't be different just for the sake of being different, at least in this field.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p><code>if not x is None</code> is more similar to other programming languages, but <code>if x is not None</code> definitely sounds more clear (and is more grammatically correct in English) to me.</p>

<p>That said it seems like it's more of a preference thing to me.</p>
