<h3>Question (ID-53513):</h3><h2>Python: What is the best way to check if a list is empty?</h2><p>For example, if passed the following:</p>

<pre><code>a = []
</code></pre>

<p>How do I check to see if <strong><code>a</code></strong> is empty?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><pre><code>if not a:
  print "List is empty"
</code></pre>

<p>Using the implicit booleanness of the empty list is quite pythonic.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The pythonic way to do it is from the <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow">style guide</a>:</p>

<p>For sequences, (strings, lists, tuples), use the fact that empty sequences are false.</p>

<p><strong>Yes:</strong></p>

<pre><code>if not seq:
if seq:
</code></pre>

<p><strong>No:</strong></p>

<pre><code>if len(seq)
if not len(seq)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>An empty list is itself considered false in true value testing (see <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/truth.html" rel="nofollow">python documentation</a>):</p>

<pre><code>a = []
if a:
     print "not empty"
</code></pre>

  <p>EDIT: Another point against testing
  the empty list as False: What about
  polymorphism? You shouldn't depend on
  a list being a list. It should just
  quack like a duck - how are you going
  to get your duckCollection to quack
  ''False'' when it has no elements?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your duckCollection should implement <code>__nonzero__</code> or <code>__len__</code> so the if a: will work without problems.</p>

Python internally keeps track of the number of elements in these containers.</p>

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I have seen the below as preferred, as it will catch the null list as well:</p>

<pre><code>if not a:
    print "The list is empty or null"
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I prefer the following:</p>

<pre><code>if a == []:
   print "The list is empty."
</code></pre>

<p>Readable and you don't have to worry about calling a function like <code>len()</code> to iterate through the variable. Although I'm not entirely sure what the BigO notation of something like this is... but Python's so blazingly fast I doubt it'd matter unless <code>a</code> was gigantic.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I prefer it explicitly:</p>

<pre><code>if len(li) == 0:
    print 'the list is empty'
</code></pre>

<p>This way it's 100% clear that <code>li</code> is a sequence (list) and we want to test its size. My problem with <code>if not li: ...</code> is that it gives the false impression that <code>li</code> is a boolean variable.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>It's silly to compare 
if a==[] because as mentioned, it breaks polymorphism, worse, extra object creation, a sin, even if it's very fast.
len IS the preferred way, because it's standard and any inherited class should support it.</p>
