<h3>Question (ID-930397):</h3><h2>How to get the last element of a list?</h2><p>I found many different ways of getting the last element from a list in Python:</p>

<pre><code>alist[-1]
alist[len(alist) -1]
</code></pre>

<p>How would you do this?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-3):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p><code>someList[-1]</code> is the shortest and most Pythonic. Why complicate things by adding an unnecessary function call in there?</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You can also do:</p>

<pre><code>alist.pop()
</code></pre>

<p>It depends on what you want to do with your list because the pop() method will delete the last element.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If astr = '' or alist = [] you can also use alist[-1:] if getting an empty string or empty list is preferred over an IndexError.</p>
