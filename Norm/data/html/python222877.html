<h3>Question (ID-222877):</h3><h2>How to use 'super' in Python?</h2><p>I was wondering if anyone could explain to me the difference between doing </p>

<pre><code>class Child(SomeBaseClass):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Child, self).__init__()
</code></pre>

<p>and this        </p>

<pre><code>class Child(SomeBaseClass):
    def __init__(self):
        SomeBaseClass.__init__(self)
</code></pre>

<p>I've seen <code>super</code> being used quite a lot in classes with only single inheritance. I can see why you'd use it in multiple inheritance but am unclear as to what the advantages are of using it in this kind of situation.</p>

<p>Any thoughts on this would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-3):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The benefits of <code>super()</code> in single-inheritance are minimal -- mostly, you don't have to hard-code the name of the base class into every method that uses its parent methods.</p>

<p>However, it's almost impossible to use multiple-inheritance without <code>super()</code>. This includes common idioms like mixins, interfaces, abstract classes, etc. This extends to code that later extends yours. If somebody later wanted to write a class that extended <code>Child</code> and a mixin, their code would not work properly.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>John is absolutely right about the benefits/uses of super.</p>

<p>Here is a good article on the <em>pitfalls</em> of <code>super()</code>: <a href="http://fuhm.net/super-harmful/" rel="nofollow">Python's Super Considered Harmful</a>.  Despite the name, it is not an inflammatory article, and carefully describes the goals and uses of <code>super()</code> as well as the issues.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Doesn't all of this assume that the base class is inherited from <code>object</code>?</p>

<pre><code>class A:
    def __init__(self):
        print "A.__init__()"

class B(A):
    def __init__(self):
        print "B.__init__()"
        super(B, self).__init__()
</code></pre>

<p>Will not work. <code>class A</code> must be derived from <code>object</code>, i.e: <code>class A(object)</code></p>
