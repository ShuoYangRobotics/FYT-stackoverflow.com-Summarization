<blockquote>
  <p>exit([arg])</p>
  
  <p>Exit from Python. This is 
  implemented by raising the SystemExit
  exception, so cleanup actions
  specified by finally clauses of try
  statements are honored, and it is
  possible to intercept the exit attempt
  at an outer level. The optional
  argument arg can be an integer giving
  the exit status (defaulting to zero),
  or another type of object. If it is an
  integer, zero is considered
  <code>successful termination'' and any
  nonzero value is considered </code>abnormal
  termination'' by shells and the like.
  Most systems require it to be in the
  range 0-127, and produce undefined
  results otherwise. Some systems have a
  convention for assigning specific
  meanings to specific exit codes, but
  these are generally underdeveloped;
  Unix programs generally use 2 for
  command line syntax errors and 1 for
  all other kind of errors. If another
  type of object is passed, None is
  equivalent to passing zero, and any
  other object is printed to sys.stderr
  and results in an exit code of 1. In
  particular, sys.exit("some error
  message") is a quick way to exit a
  program when an error occurs.</p>

<p>Note that this is the 'nice' way to exit.  @<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/73663/terminating-a-python-script#76374">glyphtwistedmatrix</a> below points out that if you want a 'hard exit', you can use os.<em>exit(</em>errorcode*), though it's likely os-specific to some extent (it might not take an errorcode under windows, for example), and it definitely is less friendly since it doesn't let the interpreter do any cleanup before the process dies.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>While you should generally prefer <code>sys.exit</code> because it is more "friendly" to other code, all it actually does is raise an exception.</p>

<p>If you are sure that you need to exit a process immediately, and you might be inside of some exception handler which would catch <code>SystemExit</code>, there is another function - <code>os._exit</code> - which terminates immediately at the C level and does not perform any of the normal tear-down of the interpreter; for example, hooks registered with the "atexit" module are not executed.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Another way is:</p>

<pre><code>raise SystemExit
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>From sys import exit:</p>

<pre><code>exit()
</code></pre>

<p>As a parameter you can pass an exit code, which will be returned to OS. Default is 0.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Presumably <code>sys.exit()</code> doesn't work (doesn't kill the process, just kills the thread) if raised by a background thread?</p>
