<h3>Question (ID-3216706):</h3><h2>If x is list, why does x += "ha" work, while x = x + "ha" throw an exception?</h2><p>From what little I know, + op for lists only requires the 2nd operand to be iterable, which "ha" clearly is.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>In Code:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = []
&gt;&gt;&gt; x += "ha"
&gt;&gt;&gt; x
['h', 'a']
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = x + "ha"
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: can only concatenate list (not "str") to list

<br /><h3>Answers (Total-3):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Using <code>+=</code> with a list is like calling <code>extend</code>, not <code>+</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li>You can call <code>extend</code> with an iterable.</li>
<li>You can only use <code>+</code> with another list.</li>
</ul>

<p>I can only guess why this decision was made, but I imagine it is for performance reasons. Calling <code>+</code> results in a new object being created and all items being copied, whereas <code>extend</code> can use free space in the existing list object saving a copy in some cases. </p>

<p>Another side-effect of this decision is that if you write <code>x += y</code> other references to the list will see the change but if you use <code>x = x + y</code> then they will not. This is demonstrated below:</p>

<pre>
>>> x = ['a','b']
>>> y = ['c', d']
>>> z = x
>>> x += y
>>> z
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']

>>> x = ['a','b']
>>> y = ['c', d']
>>> z = x
>>> x = x + y
>>> z
['a', 'b']
</pre>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You're thinking about it backwards.  You're asking why <code>x = x + 'ha'</code> throws an exception, given that <code>x += 'ha'</code> works.  Really, the question is why <code>x += 'ha'</code> works at all.</p>

<p>Everyone agrees (I hope) that <code>'abc' + 'ha'</code> and <code>[1, 2, 3] + ['h', 'a']</code> should work.  And in these cases, overloading <code>+=</code> to do in-place modification seems reasonable.</p>

<p>The language designers decided that <code>[1, 2, 3] + 'ha'</code> shouldn't, because you're mixing different types.  And that seems reasonable as well.</p>

<p>So the question is why they decided to <em>allow</em> mixing different types in the case of <code>x += 'ha'</code>.  In this case, I imagine there are a couple reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>It's a convenient shorthand</li>
<li>It's obvious what happens (you append each of the items in the iterable to <code>x</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, Python tries to let you do what you want, but where there's ambiguity, it tends to force you to be explicit.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>When defining operators, there are two different "add" operators: One is called <code>__add__</code>, the other <code>__iadd__</code>. The latter one is for in-place additions with <code>+=</code>, the other one is the regular <code>+</code> operator. <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html</a> has more infos on that.</p>
