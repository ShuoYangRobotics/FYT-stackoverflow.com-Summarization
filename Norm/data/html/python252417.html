<h3>Question (ID-252417):</h3><h2>How can I use a DLL from Python</h2><p>What is the easiest way to use a DLL from within Python?</p>

<p>Specifically, how can this be done without writing any additional wrapper C++ code to expose the functionality to Python?</p>

<p>Native Python functionality is strongly preferred over using a 3rd party library.</p>

<p>The following example of ctypes is from actual code I've written (in Python 2.5).  This has been, by far, the easiest way I've found for doing what you ask.</p>

<pre><code>import ctypes

# Load DLL into memory.

hllDll = ctypes.WinDLL ("c:\\PComm\\ehlapi32.dll")

# Set up prototype and parameters for the desired function call.
# HLLAPI

hllApiProto = ctypes.WINFUNCTYPE (ctypes.c_int,ctypes.c_void_p,
    ctypes.c_void_p, ctypes.c_void_p, ctypes.c_void_p)
hllApiParams = (1, "p1", 0), (1, "p2", 0), (1, "p3",0), (1, "p4",0),

# Actually map the call ("HLLAPI(...)") to a Ptyhon name.

hllApi = hllApiProto (("HLLAPI", hllDll), hllApiParams)

# This is how you can actually call the DLL function.
# Set up the variables and call the Python name with them.

p1 = ctypes.c_int (1)
p2 = ctypes.c_char_p (sessionVar)
p3 = ctypes.c_int (1)
p4 = ctypes.c_int (0)
hllApi (ctypes.byref (p1), p2, ctypes.byref (p3), ctypes.byref (p4))
</code></pre>

<p>The ctypes stuff has all the C-type data types (int, char, short, void*, ...) and can pass by value or reference.  It can also return specific data types although my example doesn't do that (the HLL API returns values by modifying a variable passed by reference).</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>ctypes can be used to access dlls, here's a tutorial:</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.python.org/library/ctypes.html#module-ctypes" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/library/ctypes.html#module-ctypes</a></p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You might want to have a look at <a href="http://www.swig.org/" rel="nofollow">SWIG</a>.</p>

<p><strike>I don't know of any capabilities within the standard Python libraries to do this sort of thing.</strike> It looks like the <a href="http://python.org/doc/2.5/lib/module-ctypes.html" rel="nofollow"><code>ctypes</code> library</a> is new in version 2.5 and supports calling DLLs.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>ctypes will be the easiest thing to use but (mis)using it makes python subject to crashing.  If you are trying to do something quickly, and you are careful, it's great.  I would encourage you to check out <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_36_0/libs/python/doc/index.html" rel="nofollow">boost python</a>.  Yes, it requires that you write some C++ code and have a C++ compiler, but you don't actually need to learn C++ to use it, and you can get a free (as in beer) C++ compiler from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/express/vc/" rel="nofollow">microsoft</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>simplest example of calling a dll
have a look on this link <a href="http://www.knowledgetantra.com/component/content/article/2-python/1-call-dll-function-in-python.html" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>

<p>i am using this.</p>
