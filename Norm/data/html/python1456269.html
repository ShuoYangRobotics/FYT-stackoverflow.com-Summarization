<h3>Question (ID-1456269):</h3><h2>Python Git Module experiences?</h2><p>What are people's experiences with any of the Git modules for Python?  (I know of GitPython, PyGit, and Dulwich - feel free to mention others if you know of them.)  I am writing a program which will have to interact (add, delete, commit) with a Git repository, but have no experience with Git, so one of the things I'm looking for is ease of use/understanding wrt Git.  The other things I'm primarily interested in are maturity and completeness of the library, a reasonable lack of bugs, continued development, and helpfulness of the documentation and developers.  If you think of something else I might want/need to know, please feel free to mention it.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I thought I would answer my own question, since I'm taking a different path than suggested in the answers.  Nonetheless, thanks to those who answered.</p>

<p>First, a brief synopsis of my experiences with GitPython, PyGit, and Dulwich:</p>

<ul>
<li>GitPython:  After downloading, I got this imported and the appropriate object initialized.  However, trying to do what was suggested in the tutorial led to errors.  Lacking more documentation, I turned elsewhere.</li>
<li>PyGit:  This would not even import, and I could find no documentation.</li>
<li>Dulwich:  Seems to be the most promising (at least for what I wanted and saw).  I made some progress with it, more than with GitPython, since its egg comes with Python source.  However, after a while, I decided it may just be easier to try what I did.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, StGit looks interesting, but I would need the functionality extracted into a separate module and do not want wait for that to happen right now.</p>

<p>In (much) less time than I spent trying to get the three modules above working, I managed to get git commands working via the subprocess module, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>def gitAdd(fileName, repoDir):
    cmd = 'git add ' + fileName
    pipe = subprocess.Popen(cmd, shell=True, cwd=repoDir)
    pipe.wait()
    return

gitAdd('exampleFile.txt', '/usr/local/example_git_repo_dir')
</code></pre>

<p>This isn't fully incorporated into my program yet, but I'm not anticipating a problem, except maybe speed (since I'll be processing hundreds or even thousands of files at times).</p>

<p>Maybe I just didn't have the patience to get things going with Dulwich or GitPython.  That said, I'm hopeful the modules will get more development and be more useful soon.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Maybe it helps, but Bazaar and Mercurial are both using dulwich for their Git interoperability.</p>

<p>Dulwich is probably different than the other in the sense that's it's a reimplementation of git in python. The other might just be a wrapper around Git's commands (so it could be simpler to use from a high level point of view: commit/add/delete), it probably means their API is very close to git's command line so you'll need to gain experience with Git.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>For the sake of completeness, <a href="http://github.com/alex/pyvcs/" rel="nofollow">http://github.com/alex/pyvcs/</a> is an abstraction layer for all dvcs's. It uses dulwich, but provides interop with the other dvcs's.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Here's a really quick implementation of "git status":</p>

<pre><code>import os
import string
from subprocess import *

repoDir = '/Users/foo/project'

def command(x):
    return str(Popen(x.split(' '), stdout=PIPE).communicate()[0])

def rm_empty(L): return [l for l in L if (l and l!="")]

def getUntracked():
    os.chdir(repoDir)
    status = command("git status")
    if "# Untracked files:" in status:
        untf = status.split("# Untracked files:")[1][1:].split("\n")
        return rm_empty([x[2:] for x in untf if string.strip(x) != "#" and x.startswith("#\t")])
    else:
        return []

def getNew():
    os.chdir(repoDir)
    status = command("git status").split("\n")
    return [x[14:] for x in status if x.startswith("#\tnew file:   ")]

def getModified():
    os.chdir(repoDir)
    status = command("git status").split("\n")
    return [x[14:] for x in status if x.startswith("#\tmodified:   ")]

print("Untracked:")
print( getUntracked() )
print("New:")
print( getNew() )
print("Modified:")
print( getModified() )

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>The git interaction library part of StGit is actually pretty good. However, it isn't broken out as a separate package but if there is sufficient interest, I'm sure that can be fixed.</p>

<p>It has very nice abstractions for representing commits, trees etc, and for creating new commits and trees.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>For the record, none of the aforementioned Git Python libraries seem to contain a "git status" equivalent, which is really the only thing I would want since dealing with the rest of the git commands via subprocess is so easy.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>PTBNL's Answer is quite perfect for me. 
I make a little more for Windows user. </p>
