<h3>Question (ID-642763):</h3><h2>Python - Intersection of two lists</h2><p>I know how to get an intersection of two flat lists:</p>

<pre><code>b1 = [1,2,3,4,5,9,11,15]
b2 = [4,5,6,7,8]
b3 = [val for val in b1 if val in b2]
</code></pre>

<p>or </p>

<pre><code>def intersect(a, b):
     return list(set(a) &amp; set(b))

print intersect(b1, b2)
</code></pre>

<p>But when I have to find intersection for nested lists then my problems starts:</p>

<pre><code>c1 = [1, 6, 7, 10, 13, 28, 32, 41, 58, 63]
c2 = [[13, 17, 18, 21, 32], [7, 11, 13, 14, 28], [1, 5, 6, 8, 15, 16]]
</code></pre>

<p>In the end I would like to receive:</p>

<pre><code>c3 = [[13,32],[7,13,28],[1,6]]
</code></pre>

<p>Can you guys give me a hand with this?</p>

<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You don't need to define intersection.  It's already a first-class part of set.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; b1 = [1,2,3,4,5,9,11,15]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b2 = [4,5,6,7,8]
&gt;&gt;&gt; set(b1).intersection( set(b2) )
set([4, 5])
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><strong>If you want:</strong></p>

<pre><code>c1 = [1, 6, 7, 10, 13, 28, 32, 41, 58, 63]
c2 = [[13, 17, 18, 21, 32], [7, 11, 13, 14, 28], [1, 5, 6, 8, 15, 16]]
c3 = [[13, 32], [7, 13, 28], [1,6]]
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Then here is your solution:</strong></p>

<pre><code>c3 = [filter(lambda x: x in c1, sublist) for sublist in c2]
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> </p>

<p>The filter part takes each sublist's item and checks to see if it is in the source list c1. 
The list comprehension is executed for each sublist in c2. </p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><h3>Pure list comprehension version</h3>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; c1 = [1, 6, 7, 10, 13, 28, 32, 41, 58, 63]
&gt;&gt;&gt; c2 = [[13, 17, 18, 21, 32], [7, 11, 13, 14, 28], [1, 5, 6, 8, 15, 16]]
&gt;&gt;&gt; c1set = frozenset(c1)
</code></pre>

<p>Flatten variant:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; [n for lst in c2 for n in lst if n in c1set]
[13, 32, 7, 13, 28, 1, 6]
</code></pre>

<p>Nested variant:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; [[n for n in lst if n in c1set] for lst in c2]
[[13, 32], [7, 13, 28], [1, 6]]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The functional approach:</p>

<pre><code>input_list = [[1,2,3,4,5],[2,3,4,5,6],[3,4,5,6,7]]

result = reduce(set.intersection,map(set,input_list))
</code></pre>

<p>and it can be applied to the more general case of 1+ lists</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You should flatten using this code ( taken from <a href="http://kogs-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/~meine/python%5Ftricks" rel="nofollow">http://kogs-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/~meine/python_tricks</a> ), the code is untested, but I'm pretty sure it works:</p>

<pre><code>
def flatten(x):
    """flatten(sequence) -> list

    Returns a single, flat list which contains all elements retrieved
    from the sequence and all recursively contained sub-sequences
    (iterables).

    Examples:
    >>> [1, 2, [3,4], (5,6)]
    [1, 2, [3, 4], (5, 6)]
    >>> flatten([[[1,2,3], (42,None)], [4,5], [6], 7, MyVector(8,9,10)])
    [1, 2, 3, 42, None, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]"""

    result = []
    for el in x:
        #if isinstance(el, (list, tuple)):
        if hasattr(el, "__iter__") and not isinstance(el, basestring):
            result.extend(flatten(el))
        else:
            result.append(el)
    return result
</code></pre>

<p>After you had flattened the list, you perform the intersection in the usual way:</p>

<pre><code>
c1 = [1, 6, 7, 10, 13, 28, 32, 41, 58, 63]
c2 = [[13, 17, 18, 21, 32], [7, 11, 13, 14, 28], [1, 5, 6, 8, 15, 16]]

def intersect(a, b):
     return list(set(a) & set(b))

print intersect(flatten(c1), flatten(c2))

</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>For people just looking to find the intersection of two lists, the Asker provided two methods:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>b1 = [1,2,3,4,5,9,11,15]
b2 = [4,5,6,7,8]
b3 = [val for val in b1 if val in b2]
</code></pre>
  
  <p>and</p>

<pre><code>def intersect(a, b):
     return list(set(a) &amp; set(b))

print intersect(b1, b2)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>But there is a hybrid method that is more efficient, because you only have to do one conversion between list/set, as opposed to three:</p>

<pre><code>b1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
b2 = [3,4,5,6]
s2 = set(b2)
b3 = [val for val in b1 if val in s2]
</code></pre>

<p>This will run in O(n), whereas his original method involving list comprehension will run in O(n^2)</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Do you consider <code>[1,2]</code> to intersect with <code>[1, [2]]</code>? That is, is it only the numbers you care about, or the list structure as well?</p>

<p>If only the numbers, investigate how to "flatten" the lists, then use the <code>set()</code> method.</p>
