<h3>Question (ID-492483):</h3><h2>Setting the correct encoding when piping stdout in python</h2><p>When piping the output of a python program, the python interpreter gets confused about encoding and sets it to None. This means a program like this:</p>

<pre><code># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
print "åäö"
</code></pre>

<p>will work fine when run normally, but fail with:</p>

<pre><code>UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xa0' in position 0: ordinal not in range(128)
</code></pre>

<p>when used in a pipe sequence.</p>

<p>What is the best way to make this work when piping? Can I just tell it to use whatever encoding the shell/filesystem/whatever is using? </p>

<p>The suggestions I have seen thus far is to modify your site.py directly, or hardcoding the defaultencoding using this hack:</p>

<pre><code># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import sys
reload(sys)
sys.setdefaultencoding('utf-8')
print "åäö"
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a better way to make piping work?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-4):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>First, regarding this solution:</p>

<pre><code># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
print u"åäö".encode('utf-8')
</code></pre>

<p>It's not practical to explicitly print with a given encoding every time. That would be repetitive and error-prone.</p>

<p>A better solution is to change <strong><code>sys.stdout</code></strong> at the start of your program, to encode with a selected encoding. Here is one solution I found on <a href="http://drj11.wordpress.com/2007/05/14/python-how-is-sysstdoutencoding-chosen/" rel="nofollow">Python: How is sys.stdout.encoding chosen?</a>, in particular a comment by "toka":</p>

<pre><code>import sys
import codecs
sys.stdout = codecs.getwriter('utf8')(sys.stdout)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Your code works when run in an script because python encodes the output to whatever encoding your terminal application is using. If you are piping you must encode it yourself.</p>

<p>A rule of thumb is: Always use unicode internally. decode what you receive, encode what you send.</p>

<pre><code># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
print u"åäö".encode('utf-8')
</code></pre>

<p>Another didactic example is a python program to convert between iso8859-1 and utf-8, making everything uppercase in between.</p>

<pre><code>import sys
for line in sys.stdin:
    # decode what you receive:
    line = line.decode('iso8859-1')

    # work with unicode internally:
    line = line.upper()

    # encode what you send:
    line = line.encode('utf-8')
    sys.stdout.write(line)
</code></pre>

<p>Setting system default encoding is a bad idea because some modules and libraries you use can rely on the fact it is ascii. Don't do it.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You may want to try changing the environment variable "PYTHONIOENCODING" to "utf_8." I have written a <a href="http://daveagp.wordpress.com/2010/10/26/what-a-character/" rel="nofollow">page on my ordeal with this problem</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8</p>

<p>do the job, but can't set it on python itself ... </p>
