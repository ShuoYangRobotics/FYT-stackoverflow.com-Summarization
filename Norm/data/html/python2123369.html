<h3>Question (ID-2123369):</h3><h2>What's the best solution for OpenID with Django?</h2><p>There are at least half a dozen Django apps that provide OpenID authentication for Django:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://github.com/simonw/django-openid" rel="nofollow">django-openid</a></li>
<li><a href="https://launchpad.net/django-openid-auth" rel="nofollow">django-openid-auth</a></li>
<li>another <a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-openid-auth/" rel="nofollow">django-openid-auth</a>, which seems to be dead</li>
<li><a href="http://bitbucket.org/benoitc/django-authopenid/wiki/Home" rel="nofollow">django-authopenid</a></li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/uswaretech/Django-Socialauth" rel="nofollow">django-socialauth</a> (which also provides authentication with Twitter and Facebook accounts)</li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/flashingpumpkin/django-socialregistration" rel="nofollow">django-socialregistration</a> (has Facebook and Twitter authentication, too)</li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-openid-consumer/" rel="nofollow">django-openid-consumer</a>, a fork of Simon Willison's original django-openid. Seems more suited for simple blog comments than a full fledged registration workflow</li>
</ul>

<p>I played around with a couple of them. Simon Willison's <a href="http://github.com/simonw/django-openid" rel="nofollow">django-openid</a> made a good impression, but as he is at the forefront of trendsetting in Djangoland, I sometimes have difficulties wrapping my head around his trends (e.g. the whole dynamic urlpatterns system in django-openid). What's more, I couldn't get login to work with Google.</p>

<p><a href="http://bitbucket.org/benoitc/django-authopenid/wiki/Home" rel="nofollow">django-authopenid</a> made a good impression, and it seems to have good integration with <a href="http://bitbucket.org/ubernostrum/django-registration/wiki/Home" rel="nofollow">django-registration</a>. <a href="http://github.com/uswaretech/Django-Socialauth" rel="nofollow">django-socialauth</a> and <a href="http://github.com/flashingpumpkin/django-socialregistration" rel="nofollow">django-socialregistration</a> have support for Twitter and Facebook, which is definitely a plus. Who knows if and when Facebook will start to be an OpenID provider...? socialauth seems to have <a href="http://www.elfsternberg.com/2009/11/24/django-socialauth-component-now-with-some-elfin-goodness/" rel="nofollow">its share of problems</a>, though.</p>

<p>So, what is the best OpenID app out there? Please share any positive (and negative) experience. Thanks!</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The one that has proven to work best for me, and which seems most up-to-date is the one over at launchpad.</p>

<p>It integrated seamlessly with my application that already utilizes the django.auth module.</p>

<p><a href="https://launchpad.net/django-openid-auth" rel="nofollow">https://launchpad.net/django-openid-auth</a></p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I prefer django-authopenid, but I think most of the mature solutions are pretty equal at this point. Still, it is what I see used the most. I've made a handful of customizations to how we use it without having to actually fork it, and that's a huge plus in my book. In other words, its fairly hookable.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Don't forget <a href="http://github.com/elfsternberg/Django-Socialauth" rel="nofollow">Elf Sternberg's fork</a> of django-socialauth - he's working to clean up what he sees as a lot of bad implementation decisions in the original socialauth app. Looks clean so far but it's unclear whether his project will have momentum.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The last post for this thread is in February. It's been almost 8 months and I'm pretty sure a lot of things have been changed. </p>

<p>I am very interested in Django-Socialauth since it supports gmail, yahoo, facebook, twitter, and OpenID.</p>

<p>I found two forks that seem up-to-date:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/uswaretech/Django-Socialauth" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/uswaretech/Django-Socialauth</a></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/agiliq/Django-Socialauth" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/agiliq/Django-Socialauth</a></p>

<p>The second fork has been recently updated at this moment. </p>

<p>I was wondering if anyone has recently used any of these forks? I am looking for the most reliable one for my website.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
