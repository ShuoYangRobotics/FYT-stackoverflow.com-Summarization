<h3>Question (ID-204017):</h3><h2>How do I execute a program from python? os.system fails due to spaces in path</h2><p>I have a python script that needs to execute an external program, but for some reason fails.</p>

<p>If I have the following script:</p>

<pre><code>import os;
os.system("C:\\Temp\\a b c\\Notepad.exe");
raw_input();
</code></pre>

<p>Then it fails with the following error:</p>

<pre><code>'C:\Temp\a' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
</code></pre>

<p>If I escape the program with quotes:</p>

<pre><code>import os;
os.system('"C:\\Temp\\a b c\\Notepad.exe"');
raw_input();
</code></pre>

<p>Then it works. However, if I add a parameter, it stops working again:</p>

<pre><code>import os;
os.system('"C:\\Temp\\a b c\\Notepad.exe" "C:\\test.txt"');
raw_input();
</code></pre>

<p>What is the right way to execute a program and wait for it to complete? I do not need to read output from it, as it is a visual program that does a job and then just exits, but I need to wait for it to complete.</p>

<p>Also note, moving the program to a non-spaced path is not an option either.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> This does not work either:</p>

<pre><code>import os;
os.system("'C:\\Temp\\a b c\\Notepad.exe'");
raw_input();
</code></pre>

<p>Note the swapped single/double quotes.</p>

<p>with or without a parameter to notepad here, it fails with the error message</p>

<pre><code>The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.
</code></pre>

<pre><code>import subprocess
subprocess.call(['C:\\Temp\\a b c\\Notepad.exe'])
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The outermost quotes are consumed by Python itself, and the Windows shell doesn't see it. As mentioned above, Windows only understands double-quotes. 
Python will convert forward-slashed to backslashes on Windows, so you can use</p>

<pre><code>os.system('"C:/Temp/a b c/Notepad.exe"')
</code></pre>

<p>The ' is consumed by Python, which then passes "C:\Temp\a b c\Notepad.exe" (as a Windows path, no double-backslashes needed) to CMD.EXE</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Here's a different way of doing it.</p>

<p>If you're using windows the following acts like double-clicking the file in Explorer, or giving the file name as an argument to the DOS "start" command:  the file is opened with whatever application (if any) its extension is associated.</p>

<pre><code>import os
os.startfile(filepath)
</code></pre>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>import os
os.startfile(textfile.txt)
</code></pre>

<p>This will open textfile.txt with notepad if notepad is associted with .txt files.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>At least in Windows 7 and Python 3.1, os.system in Windows wants the command line <em>double-quoted</em> if there are spaces in path to the command. For example:</p>

<pre><code>  TheCommand = '\"\"C:\\Temp\\a b c\\Notepad.exe\"\"'
  os.system(TheCommand)
</code></pre>

<p>A real-world example that was stumping me was cloning a drive in Virtual box. The subprocess.call solution above didn't work because of some access rights issue, but when I double-quoted the command, os.system became happy:</p>

<pre><code>  TheCommand = '\"\"C:\\Program Files\\Sun\\VirtualBox\\VBoxManage.exe\" ' \
                 + ' clonehd \"' + OrigFile + '\" \"' + NewFile + '\"\"'
  os.system(TheCommand)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I suspect it's the same problem as when you use shortcuts in Windows... Try this:</p>

<pre><code>import os;
os.system("\"C:\\Temp\\a b c\\Notepad.exe\" C:\\test.txt");
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>import win32api # if active state python is installed or install pywin32 package seperately</p>

<p>try: win32api.WinExec('NOTEPAD.exe') # Works seamlessly
except: pass</p>
