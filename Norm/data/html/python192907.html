<h3>Question (ID-192907):</h3><h2>XML parsing - ElementTree vs SAX and DOM</h2><p>Python has several ways to parse XML...</p>

<p>I understand the very basics of parsing with <strong>SAX</strong>.  It functions as a stream parser, with an event-driven API.</p>

<p>I understand the <strong>DOM</strong> parser also.  It reads the XML into memory and coverts it to objects that can be accessed with Python.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, it was easy to choose between the 2 depending on what you needed to do, memory constraints, performance, etc.</p>

<p>(hopefully I'm correct so far).</p>

<p>Since Python 2.5, we also have <strong>ElementTree</strong>. How does this compare to DOM and SAX? Which is it more similar to? Why is it better than the previous parsers?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-3):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>ElementTree is much easier to use, because it represents an XML tree (basically) as a structure of lists, and attributes are represented as dictionaries.</p>

<p>ElementTree needs much less memory for XML trees than DOM (and thus is faster), and the parsing overhead via <code>iterparse</code> is comparable to SAX. Additionally, <code>iterparse</code> returns partial structures, and you can keep memory usage constant during parsing by discarding the structures as soon as you process them.</p>

<p>ElementTree, as in Python 2.5, has only a small feature set compared to full-blown XML libraries, but it's enough for many applications. If you need a validating parser or complete XPath support, lxml is the way to go. For a long time, it used to be quite unstable, but I haven't had any problems with it since 2.1.</p>

<p>ElementTree deviates from DOM, where nodes have access to their parent and siblings. Handling actual documents rather than data stores is also a bit cumbersome, because text nodes aren't treated as actual nodes. In the XML snippet</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a&gt;This is &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; test&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The string <code> test</code> will be the so-called <code>tail</code> of element <code>b</code>.</p>

<p>In general, I recommend ElementTree as the default for all XML processing with Python, and DOM or SAX as the solutions for specific problems.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>ElementTree's parse() is like DOM, whereas iterparse() is like SAX. In my opinion, ElementTree is better than DOM and SAX in that it provides API easier to work with.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>ElementTree has more pythonic API. It also is in standard library now so using it reduces dependencies.</p>

<p>I actually prefer <a href="http://codespeak.net/lxml/" rel="nofollow">lxml</a> as it has API like ElementTree, but has also nice additional features and performs well.</p>
