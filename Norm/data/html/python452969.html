<h3>Question (ID-452969):</h3><h2>Does python have an equivalent to Java Class.forName()?</h2><p>I have the need to take a string argument and create a class in python.  In Java, I would use Class.forName().newInstance().  Is there an equivalent in python?</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>Thanks for the responses.  To answer those who want to know what I'm doing: I want to use a command line argument as the class name, and instantiate it.  I'm actually programming in Jython and instantiating Java classes, hence the Java-ness of the question.  getattr() works great.  Thanks much.</p>

<p>There's no direct function (that I know of) which takes a fully qualified class name and returns the class, however you have all the pieces needed to build that, and you can connect them together.</p>

<p>One advice though: don't try to program in Java style when you're in python.</p>

<p>If you can explain what is it that you're trying to do, maybe we can help you find a more pythonic way of doing it.</p>

<p>Here's a function that does what you want:</p>

<pre><code>def get_class( kls ):
    parts = kls.split('.')
    module = ".".join(parts[:-1])
    m = __import__( module )
    for comp in parts[1:]:
        m = getattr(m, comp)            
    return m
</code></pre>

<p>You can use the return value of this function as if it was the class itself.</p>

<p>Here's a usage example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; D = get_class("datetime.datetime")
&gt;&gt;&gt; D
&lt;type 'datetime.datetime'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; D.now()
datetime.datetime(2009, 1, 17, 2, 15, 58, 883000)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = D( 2010, 4, 22 )
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
datetime.datetime(2010, 4, 22, 0, 0)
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>How does that work?</strong></p>

<p>We're using <code>__import__</code> to import the module that holds the class, which required that we first extract the module name from the fully qualified name. Then we import the module:</p>

<pre><code>m = __import__( module )
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, <code>m</code> will only refer to the top level module, </p>

<p>For example, if your class lives in <code>foo.baz</code> module, then <code>m</code> will be the module <code>foo</code><br />
We can easily obtain a reference to <code>foo.baz</code> using <code>getattr( m, 'baz' )</code></p>

<p>To get from the top level module to the class, have to recursively use <code>gettatr</code> on the parts of the class name</p>

<p>Say for example, if you class name is <code>foo.baz.bar.Model</code> then we do this:</p>

<pre><code>m = __import__( "foo.baz.bar" ) #m is package foo
m = getattr( m, "baz" ) #m is package baz
m = getattr( m, "bar" ) #m is module bar
m = getattr( m, "Model" ) #m is class Model
</code></pre>

<p>This is what's happening in this loop:</p>

<pre><code>for comp in parts[1:]:
    m = getattr(m, comp)
</code></pre>

<p>At the end of the loop, <code>m</code> will be a reference to the class. This means that <code>m</code> is actually the class itslef, you can do for instance:</p>

<pre><code>a = m() #instantiate a new instance of the class    
b = m( arg1, arg2 ) # pass arguments to the constructor
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Assuming the class is in your scope:</p>

<pre><code>globals()['classname'](args, to, constructor)
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise:</p>

<pre><code>getattr(someModule, 'classname')(args, to, constructor)
</code></pre>

<p>Edit:  Note, you can't give a name like 'foo.bar' to getattr.  You'll need to split it by . and call getattr() on each piece left-to-right.  This will handle that:</p>

<pre><code>module, rest = 'foo.bar.baz'.split('.', 1)
fooBar = reduce(lambda a, b: getattr(a, b), rest.split('.'), globals()[module])
someVar = fooBar(args, to, constructor)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>It seems you're approaching this from the middle instead of the beginning. What are you really trying to do? Finding the class associated with a given string is a means to an end.</p>

<p>If you clarify your problem, which might require your own mental refactoring, a better solution may present itself.</p>

<p>For instance: Are you trying to load a saved object based on its type name and a set of parameters? Python spells this unpickling and you should look at the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/pickle.html" rel="nofollow">pickle module</a>. And even though the unpickling process does exactly what you describe, you don't have to worry about how it works internally:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class A(object):
...   def __init__(self, v):
...     self.v = v
...   def __reduce__(self):
...     return (self.__class__, (self.v,))
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = A("example")
&gt;&gt;&gt; import pickle
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = pickle.loads(pickle.dumps(a))
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.v, b.v
('example', 'example')
&gt;&gt;&gt; a is b
False
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Yet another implementation.</p>

<pre><code>def import_class(class_string):
    """Returns class object specified by a string.

    Args:
        class_string: The string representing a class.

    Raises:
        ValueError if module part of the class is not specified.
    """
    module_name, _, class_name = class_string.rpartition('.')
    if module_name == '':
        raise ValueError('Class name must contain module part.')
    return getattr(
        __import__(module_name, globals(), locals(), [class_name], -1),
        class_name)
</code></pre>
