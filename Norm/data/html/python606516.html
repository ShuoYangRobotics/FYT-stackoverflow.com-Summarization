<h3>Question (ID-606516):</h3><h2>Python Graph Library</h2><p>I'm writing a python application that will make heavy use of a graph data structure. Nothing horribly complex, but I'm thinking some sort of graph/graph-algorithms library would help me out. I've googled around, but I don't find anything that particularly leaps out at me.</p>

<p>Anyone have any good recommendations?</p>

<p><a href="http://networkx.lanl.gov/" rel="nofollow">NetworkX</a></p>

<p>and </p>

<p><a href="http://cneurocvs.rmki.kfki.hu/igraph/" rel="nofollow">igraph</a></p>

<p>I like NetworkX, but I read good things about igraph as well.  I routinely use NetworkX with graphs with 1 million nodes with no problem (it's about double the overhead of a dict of size V + E)</p>

<p>If you want a feature comparison, see this from the Networkx-discuss list</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Have you looked at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/python-graph/" rel="nofollow">python-graph</a>?  I haven't used it myself, but the project page looks promising.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Also, you might want to take a look at <a href="http://networkx.lanl.gov/" rel="nofollow">NetworkX</a></p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Take a look at <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/essays/graphs.html" rel="nofollow">this page on implementing graphs in python</a>.</p>

<p>You could also take a look at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pygraphlib/" rel="nofollow">pygraphlib</a> on sourceforge.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I would like to plug my own graph python library: <a href="http://graph-tool.skewed.de" rel="nofollow">graph-tool</a>.</p>

<p>It is very fast, since it is implemented in C++ with the Boost Graph Library, and it contains lots of algorithms and extensive documentation.</p>
