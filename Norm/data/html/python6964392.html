<h3>Question (ID-6964392):</h3><h2>Speed comparison with Project Euler: C vs Python vs Erlang vs Haskell</h2><p>I have taken <a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=12" rel="nofollow">Problem #12</a> from <a href="http://projecteuler.net/" rel="nofollow">Project Euler</a> as a programming exercise and to compare my (surely not optimal) implementations in C, Python, Erlang and Haskell. In order to get some higher execution times, I search for the first triangle number with more than 1000 divisors instead of 500 as stated in the original problem.</p>

<p>The result is the following:</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>C: 100%</li>
<li>python: 692% (118% with pypy)</li>
<li>erlang: 436% (135% thanks to RichardC)</li>
<li>haskell: 1421%</li>
</ul>

<p>I suppose that C has a big advantage as it uses long for the calculations and not arbitrary length integers as the other three. Also it doesn't need to load a runtime first (Do the others?).</p>

<p><strong>Question 1:</strong>
Do Erlang, Python and Haskell loose speed due to using arbitrary length integers or don't they as long as the values are less than <code>MAXINT</code>?</p>

<p><strong>Question 2:</strong>
Why is Haskell so slow? Is there a compiler flag that turns off the brakes or is it my implementation? (The latter is quite probable as Haskell is a book with seven seals to me.)</p>

<p><strong>Question 3:</strong>
Can you offer me some hints how to optimize these implementations without changing the way I determine the factors? Optimization in any way: nicer, faster, more "native" to the language.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Question 4:</strong>
Do my functional implementations permit LCO (last call optimization, a.k.a tail recursion elimination) and hence avoid adding unnecessary frames onto the call stack?</p>

<p>I really tried to implement the same algorithm as similar as possible in the four languages, although I have to admit that my Haskell and Erlang knowledge is very limited.</p>

<p>EDIT: So now that we've explored that, lets address the questions</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Question 1: Do erlang, python and haskell loose speed due to using
  arbitrary length integers or don't they as long as the values are less
  than MAXINT?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Haskell, using <code>Integer</code> is slower than <code>Int</code> but how much slower depends on the computations performed.  Luckily (for 64 bit machines) <code>Int</code> is sufficient.  For portability sake you should probably rewrite my code to use <code>Int64</code> or <code>Word64</code> (C isn't the only language with a <code>long</code>).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Question 2: Why is haskell so slow? Is there a compiler flag that
  turns off the brakes or is it my implementation? (The latter is quite
  probable as haskell is a book with seven seals to me.)</p>
  
  <p>Question 3: Can you offer me some hints how to optimize these
  implementations without changing the way I determine the factors?
  Optimization in any way: nicer, faster, more "native" to the language.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was what I answered above.   The answer was 0) Use optimization via <code>-O2</code> 1) Specialization (avoid unneeded polymorphism) 2) <code>rem</code> not <code>mod</code> (a frequently forgotten optimization) and 3) worker/wrapper transformation (perhaps the most common optimization).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Question 4: Do my functional implementations permit LCO and hence
  avoid adding unnecessary frames onto the call stack?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, that wasn't the issue.  Good work and glad you considered this.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>There are some problems with the Erlang implementation. As baseline for the following, my measured execution time for your unmodified Erlang program was 47.6 seconds, compared to 12.7 seconds for the C code.</p>

<p>The first thing you should do if you want to run computationally intensive Erlang code is to use native code. Compiling with "erlc +native euler12" got the time down to 41.3 seconds. This is however a much lower speedup (just 15%) than expected from native compilation on this kind of code, and the problem is your use of "-compile(export_all)". This is useful for experimentation, but the fact that all functions are potentially reachable from the outside causes the native compiler to be very conservative. (The normal BEAM emulator is not that much affected.) Replacing this declaration with "-export([solve/0])." gives a much better speedup: 31.5 seconds (almost 35% from the baseline).</p>

<p>But the code itself has a problem: for <em>each iteration</em> in the factorCount loop, you perform this test:</p>

<pre><code>factorCount (_, Sqrt, Candidate, Count) when Candidate == Sqrt -&gt; Count + 1;
</code></pre>

<p>The C code doesn't do this. In general, it can be tricky to make a fair comparison between different implementations of the same code, and in particular if the algorithm is numerical, because you need to be sure that they are actually doing the same thing. A slight rounding error in one implementation due to some typecast somewhere may cause it to do many more iterations than the other even though both eventually reach the same result.</p>

<p>To eliminate this possible error source (and get rid of the extra test in each iteration), I rewrote the factorCount function as follows, closely modelled on the C code:</p>

<pre><code>factorCount (N) -&gt;
    Sqrt = math:sqrt (N),
    ISqrt = trunc(Sqrt),
    if ISqrt == Sqrt -&gt; factorCount (N, ISqrt, 1, -1);
       true          -&gt; factorCount (N, ISqrt, 1, 0)
    end.

factorCount (_N, ISqrt, Candidate, Count) when Candidate &gt; ISqrt -&gt; Count;
factorCount ( N, ISqrt, Candidate, Count) -&gt;
    case N rem Candidate of
        0 -&gt; factorCount (N, ISqrt, Candidate + 1, Count + 2);
        _ -&gt; factorCount (N, ISqrt, Candidate + 1, Count)
    end.
</code></pre>

<p>This rewrite, no "export_all", and native compilation, gave me the following run time:</p>

<pre><code>$ erlc +native euler12.erl
$ time erl -noshell -s euler12 solve
842161320

real    0m19.468s
user    0m19.450s
sys 0m0.010s
</code></pre>

<p>which is not too bad compared to the C code:</p>

<pre><code>$ time ./a.out 
842161320

real    0m12.755s
user    0m12.730s
sys 0m0.020s
</code></pre>

<p>considering that Erlang is not at all geared towards writing numerical code, being only 50% slower than C on a program like this is pretty good.</p>

<p>Finally, regarding your questions:</p>

<p><strong>Question 1: Do erlang, python and haskell loose speed due to using arbitrary length integers or 
don't they as long as the values are less than MAXINT?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, somewhat. In Erlang, there is no way of saying "use 32/64-bit arithmetic with wrap-around", so unless the compiler can prove some bounds on your integers (and it usually can't), it must check all computations to see if they can fit in a single tagged word or if it has to turn them into heap-allocated bignums. Even if no bignums are ever used in practice at runtime, these checks will have to be performed. On the other hand, that means you <em>know</em> that the algorithm will never fail because of an unexpected integer wraparound if you suddenly give it larger inputs than before.</p>

<p><strong>Question 4: Do my functional implementations permit LCO and hence avoid adding unnecessary frames onto the call stack?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, your Erlang code is correct with respect to last call optimization.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Take a look at <a href="http://scrollingtext.org/" rel="nofollow">this blog</a>. Over the past year or so he's done a few of the Project Euler problems in Haskell and Python, and he's generally found <em>Haskell</em> to be much faster. I think that between those languages it has more to do with your fluency and coding style.</p>

<p>When it comes to Python speed, you're using the wrong implementation! Try <a href="http://pypy.org/" rel="nofollow">PyPy</a>, and for things like this you'll find it to be much, much faster.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>In regards to Python optimization, in addition to using PyPy (for pretty impressive speed-ups with zero change to your code), you could use PyPy's <a href="http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/translation.html" rel="nofollow">translation toolchain</a> to compile an RPython-compliant version, or <a href="http://docs.cython.org/src/quickstart/overview.html" rel="nofollow">Cython</a> to build an extension module, both of which are faster than the C version in my testing, with the Cython module <strong>nearly twice as fast</strong>.

<p>The RPython version has a couple of key changes. To translate into a standalone program you need to define your <code>target</code>, which in this case is the <code>main</code> function. It's expected to accept <code>sys.argv</code> as it's only argument, and is required to return an int. You can translate it by using translate.py, <code>% translate.py euler12-rpython.py</code> which translates to C and compiles it for you.</p>

<pre><code># euler12-rpython.py

import math, sys

def factorCount(n):
    square = math.sqrt(n)
    isquare = int(square)
    count = -1 if isquare == square else 0
    for candidate in xrange(1, isquare + 1):
        if not n % candidate: count += 2
    return count

    while factorCount(triangle) &lt; 1001:

<p>The Cython version was rewritten as an extension module <code>_euler12.pyx</code>, which I import and call from a normal python file. The <code>_euler12.pyx</code> is essentially the same as your version, with some additional static type declarations. The setup.py has the normal boilerplate to build the extension, using <code>python setup.py build_ext --inplace</code>.</p>

    count = -1 if isquare == square else 0
    for candidate in range(1, isquare + 1):

<p>I honestly have very little experience with either RPython or Cython, and was pleasantly surprised at the results. If you are using CPython, writing your CPU-intensive bits of code in a Cython extension module seems like a really easy way to optimize your program.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><blockquote>Question 1: Do erlang, python and haskell loose speed due to using arbitrary length integers or don't they as long as the values are less than MAXINT?</blockquote>

<p>This is unlikely. I cannot say much about Erlang and Haskell (well, maybe a bit about Haskell below) but I can point a lot of other bottlenecks in Python. Every time the program tries to execute an operation with some values in Python, it should verify whether the values are from the proper type, and it costs a bit of time. Your <code>factorCount</code> function just allocates a list with <code>range (1, isquare + 1)</code> various times, and runtime, <code>malloc</code>-styled memory allocation is way slower than iterating on a range with a counter as you do in C. Notably, the <code>factorCount()</code> is called multiple times and so allocates a lot of lists. Also, let us not forget that Python is interpreted and the CPython interpreter has no great focus on being optimized.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: oh, well, I note that you are using Python 3 so <code>range()</code> does not return a list, but a generator. In this case, my point about allocating lists is half-wrong: the function just allocates <code>range</code> objects, which are inefficient nonetheless but not as inefficient as allocating a list with a lot of items.</p>

<blockquote>Question 2: Why is haskell so slow? Is there a compiler flag that turns off the brakes or is it my implementation? (The latter is quite probable as haskell is a book with seven seals to me.)</blockquote>

<p>Are you using <a href="http://www.haskell.org/hugs/" rel="nofollow">Hugs</a>? Hugs is a considerably slow interpreter. If you are using it, maybe you can get a better time with <a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/" rel="nofollow">GHC</a> - but I am only cogitating hypotesis, the kind of stuff a good Haskell compiler does under the hood is pretty fascinating and way beyond my comprehension :)</p>

<blockquote>Question 3: Can you offer me some hints how to optimize these implementations without changing the way I determine the factors? Optimization in any way: nicer, faster, more "native" to the language.</blockquote>

<p>I'd say you are playing an unfunny game. The best part of knowing various languages is to use them the most different way possible :) But I digress, I just do not have any recommendation for this point. Sorry, I hope someone can help you in this case :)</p>

<blockquote>
Question 4: Do my functional implementations permit LCO and hence avoid adding unnecessary frames onto the call stack?</blockquote>

<p>As far as I remember, you just need to make sure that your recursive call is the last command before returning a value. In other words, a function like the one below could use such optimization:</p>

<pre><code>def factorial(n, acc=1):
    if n &gt; 1:
        acc = acc * n
        n = n - 1
        return factorial(n, acc)
    else:
        return acc
</code></pre>

<p>However, you would not have such optimization if your function were such as the one below, because there is an operation (multiplication) after the recursive call:</p>

<pre><code>def factorial2(n):
    if n &gt; 1:
        f = factorial2(n-1)
        return f*n
    else:
        return 1
</code></pre>

<p>I separated the operations in some local variables for make it clear which operations are executed. However, the most usual is to see these functions as below, but they are equivalent for the point I am making:</p>

<pre><code>def factorial(n, acc=1):
    if n &gt; 1:
        return factorial(n-1, acc*n)
    else:
        return acc

def factorial2(n):
    if n &gt; 1:
        return n*factorial(n-1)
    else:
        return 1
</code></pre>

<p>Note that it is up to the compiler/interpreter to decide if it will make tail recursion. For example, the Python interpreter does not do it if I remember well (I used Python in my example only because of its fluent syntax). Anyway, if you find strange stuff such as factorial functions with two parameters (and one of the parameters has names such as <code>acc</code>, <code>accumulator</code> etc.) now you know why people do it :) </p>

</blockquote>

<p>The C implementation is suboptimal (as hinted at by Thomas M. DuBuisson), the version uses 64-bit integers (i.e. <strong>long</strong> datatype).  I'll investigate the assembly listing later, but with an educated guess, there are some memory accesses going on in the compiled code, which make using 64-bit integers significantly slower. It's that or generated code (be it the fact that you can fit less 64-bit ints in a SSE register or round a double to a 64-bit integer is slower).</p>

<p>Here is the modified code (simply replace <em>long</em> with <em>int</em> and I explicitly inlined factorCount, although I do not think that this is necessary with gcc -O3):</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

static inline int factorCount(int n)
{
    double square = sqrt (n);
    int isquare = (int)square;
    int count = isquare == square ? -1 : 0;
    int candidate;
    for (candidate = 1; candidate &lt;= isquare; candidate ++)
        if (0 == n % candidate) count += 2;
    return count;
}

int main ()
{
    int triangle = 1;
    int index = 1;
    while (factorCount (triangle) &lt; 1001)
    {
        index++;
        triangle += index;
    }

<pre><code>$ ghc -O2 -fllvm -fforce-recomp euler12.hs; time ./euler12                                                                                      [9:40]
[1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( euler12.hs, euler12.o )
Linking euler12 ...

./euler12  9.43s user 0.13s system 99% cpu 9.602 total

<p>Conclusion: Taking nothing away from ghc, its a great compiler, but gcc normally generates faster code.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Looking at your Erlang implementation. The timing has included the start up of the entire virtual machine, running your program and halting the virtual machine. Am pretty sure that setting up and halting the erlang vm takes some time.</p>

<p>If the timing was done within the erlang virtual machine itself, results would be different as in that case we would have the actual time for only the program in question. Otherwise, i believe that the total time taken by the process of starting and loading of the Erlang Vm plus that of halting it (as you put it in your program) are all included in the total time which the method you are using to time the program is outputting. Consider using the erlang timing itself which we use when we want to time our programs within the virtual machine itself
<a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/timer.html#tc-1" rel="nofollow"><b><code>timer:tc/1 or timer:tc/2 or timer:tc/3</code></b></a>. In this way, the results from erlang will exclude the time taken to start and stop/kill/halt the virtual machine. That is my reasoning there, think about it, and then try your bench mark again.</p>

<p>I actually suggest that we try to time the program (for languages that have a runtime), within the runtime of those languages in order to get a precise value. C for example has no overhead of starting and shutting down a runtime system as does Erlang, Python and Haskell (98% sure of this - i stand correction). So (based on this reasoning) i conclude by saying that this benchmark wasnot precise /fair enough for languages running on top of a runtime system. Lets do it again with these changes.</p>

<p>EDIT: besides even if all the languages had runtime systems, the overhead of starting each and halting it would differ. so i suggest we time from within the runtime systems (for the languages for which this applies). The Erlang VM is known to have considerable overhead at start up!</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>C is fast, but parallelized Haskell can be faster. See <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell_in_5_steps" rel="nofollow">Haskell in 5 Steps</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>There is a <a href="http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/which-programming-languages-are-fastest.php?gcc=on&amp;ghc=on&amp;hipe=on&amp;python3=on&amp;calc=chart" rel="nofollow">webpage</a> associated solely to showing the speed differences in languages.  Based on your data versus the shootout page, I would say that your algorithm is not as good as some of the others used in the shootout page.</p>
