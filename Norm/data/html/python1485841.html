<h3>Question (ID-1485841):</h3><h2>Python: Behaviour of increment and decrement operators</h2><p>I am a newbie to Python. I notice that a pre-increment/decrement operator can be applied on a variable (like <code>++count</code>). It compiles, but it does not actually change the value of the variable!</p>

<p><strong>What</strong> is the behavior of the pre-<strong>increment</strong>/<strong>decrement</strong> <strong>operators</strong> (++/--) in Python? <strong>Why</strong> does Python deviate from the behavior of these operators seen in C/C++?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-3):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p><code>++</code> is not an operator. It is two <code>+</code> operators. The <code>+</code> operator is the <strong>identity</strong> operator, which does nothing. (Clarification: the <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> unary operators only work on numbers, but I presume that you wouldn't expect a hypothetical <code>++</code> operator to work on strings.)</p>

<pre><code>++count
</code></pre>

<p>Parses as</p>

<pre><code>+(+count)
</code></pre>

<p>Which translates to</p>

<pre><code>count
</code></pre>

<p>You have to use the slightly longer <code>+=</code> operator to do what you want to do:</p>

<pre><code>count += 1
</code></pre>

<p>I suspect the <code>++</code> and <code>--</code> operators were left out for consistency and simplicity. I don't know the exact argument Guido van Rossum gave for the decision, but I can imagine a few arguments:</p>

<ul>
<li>Simpler parsing. Technically, parsing <code>++count</code> is ambiguous, as it could be <code>+</code>, <code>+</code>, <code>count</code> (two unary <code>+</code> operators) just as easily as it could be <code>++</code>, <code>count</code> (one unary <code>++</code> operator). It's not a significant syntactic ambiguity, but it does exist.</li>
<li>Simpler language. <code>++</code> is nothing more than a synonym for <code>+= 1</code>. It was a shorthand invented because C compilers were stupid and didn't know how to optimize <code>a += 1</code> into the <code>inc</code> instruction most computers have. In this day of optimizing compilers and bytecode interpreted languages, adding operators to a language to allow programmers to optimize their code is usually frowned upon, especially in a language like Python that is designed to be consistent and readable.</li>
<li>Confusing side-effects. One common newbie error in languages with <code>++</code> operators is mixing up the differences (both in precedence and in return value) between the pre- and post-incremend/decrement operators, and Python likes to eliminate language "gotcha"-s. The precedence issues of pre-/post-increment in C are pretty hairy, and incredibly easy to mess up.</li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>When you want to increment or decrement, you typically want to do that on an integer. Like so:</p>

<pre><code>b++;
</code></pre>

<p>But in Python, integers are <strong>immutable</strong>. That is you can't change them. This is because the integer objects can be used under several names. Try this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; b = 5
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 5
&gt;&gt;&gt; id(a)
162334512
&gt;&gt;&gt; id(b)
162334512
&gt;&gt;&gt; a is b
True
</code></pre>

<p>a and b above are actually the same object. If you incremented a, you would also increment b. That's not what you want. So you have to reassign. Like this:</p>

<pre><code>b = b + 1
</code></pre>

<p>Or simpler:</p>

<pre><code>b += 1
</code></pre>

<p>Which will reassign b to b+1. That is not an increment operator, because it does not increment b, it reassigns it.</p>

<p>In short: Python behaves differently here, because it is not C, and is not a low level wrapper around machine code, but a high-level dynamic language, where increments don't make sense, and also are not as necessary as in C, where you use them every time you have a loop, for example.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>In python ++(increment) or --(decrement) operators do not exist. In case of C++</p>

<pre><code>int a = 5;
b = ++a;
</code></pre>

<p>b will be assigned the value 6.
But, in python a++ will generate a syntax error as + or ++ is a binary operator and it needs a second operand.
+a, ++a, +++++++a are all read by the python interpreter as +a</p>

<p>and doing something like this in python</p>

<pre><code>a = 5
b = a ++ 5   // b is assigned 10
b = a +++ 5   // b is again assigned 10
</code></pre>

<p>So, ++ means simply two pluses.</p>
