<h3>Question (ID-446052):</h3><h2>Python: Best way to check for Python version in program that uses new language features?</h2><p>If I have a python script that requires at least a particular
version of python, what is the correct way to fail gracefully
when an earlier version of python is used to launch the script?</p>

<p>How do I get control early enough to issue an error message
and exit?</p>

<p>For example, I have a program that uses the ternery operator (new in 2.5) and "with" blocks
(new in 2.6).  I wrote a simple little interpreter-version
checker routine which is the first thing the script would
call ... except it doesn't get that far.  Instead, the
script fails during python compilation, before my routines
are even called.  Thus the user of the script sees some very
obscure synax error tracebacks - which pretty much require
an expert to deduce that it is simply the case of running
the wrong version of python.</p>

<p><strong>update</strong></p>

<p>I know how to check the version of python.  The issue is that some syntax is illegal in older versions of python.   Consider this program:</p>

<pre><code>import sys
if sys.version_info &lt; (2, 4):
    raise "must use python 2.5 or greater"
else:
    # syntax error in 2.4, ok in 2.5
    x = 1 if True else 2
    print x
</code></pre>

<p>When run under 2.4, I want this result</p>

<pre><code>$ ~/bin/python2.4 tern.py 
must use python2.5 or greater
</code></pre>

<p>and not this result:</p>

<pre><code>$ ~/bin/python2.4 tern.py 
  File "tern.py", line 5
    x = 1 if True else 2
           ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
</code></pre>

<br /><h3>Answers (Total-11):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You can test using <code>eval</code>:</p>

<pre><code>try:
  eval("1 if True else 2")
except SyntaxError:
  # doesn't have ternary
</code></pre>

<p>Also, <code>with</code> <em>is</em> available in Python 2.5, just add <code>from __future__ import with_statement </code>.</p>

<p>EDIT: to get control early enough, you could split it do different <code>.py</code> files and check compatibility in the main file before importing (e.g. in <code>__init__.py</code> in a package):</p>

<pre><code># __init__.py

# Check compatibility
try:
  eval("1 if True else 2")
except SyntaxError:
  raise ImportError("requires ternary support")

# import from another module
from impl import *
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Have a wrapper around your program that does the following:</p>

<pre><code>import sys

req_version = (2,5)
cur_version = sys.version_info()

if (cur_version[0] &gt; req_version[0] or
    (cur_version[0] == req_version[0] and
    cur_version[1] &gt;= req_version[1]):
   import myApp
   myApp.run()
else:
   print "Your python interpreter is too old. Please consider upgrading."
</code></pre>

<p>You can also consider using sys.version(), if you plan to encounter people who are using pre-2.0 python interpreters, but then you have some regexing to do.</p>

<p>And there might be more elegant ways to do this, but this is what I could think up in 5 minutes time. YMMV.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Probably the best way to do do this version comparison is to use the <code>sys.hexversion</code>. This is important because comparing version tuples will not give you the desired result in all python versions.</p>

<pre><code>import sys
if sys.hexversion &lt; 0x02060000:
    print "yep!"
else:
    print "oops!"
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Try </p>

<pre>
import platform
platform.python_version()
</pre>

<p>Should give you a string like "2.3.1". If this is not exactly waht you want there is a rich set of data available through the "platform" build-in. What you want should be in there somewhere. </p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>sets became part of the core language in 2.4, in order to stay backwards compatible, I did this back then, which will work for you as well:</p>

<pre><code>if sys.version_info &lt; (2, 4):
    from sets import Set as set
</code></pre>

<p>HTH</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I think the best way is to test for functionality rather than versions. In some cases, this is trivial, not so in others.</p>

<p>eg:</p>

<pre><code>try :
    # Do stuff
except : # Features weren't found.
    # Do stuff for older versions.
</code></pre>

<p>As long as you're specific in enough in using the try/except blocks, you can cover most of your bases.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>How about</p>

<pre><code>import sys

def testPyVer(reqver):
  if float(sys.version[:3]) &gt;= reqver:
    return 1
  else:
    return 0

#blah blah blah, more code

if testPyVer(3.0) = 1:
  #do stuff
else:
  #print python requirement, exit statement
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>The problem is quite simple. You checked if the version was LESS THAN 2.4, not less than OR EQUAL TO. So if the python version is 2.4, it's not less than 2.4.
what you should have had was:</p>

<pre><code>if sys.version_info **&lt;=** (2, 4):
</code></pre>

<p>not:</p>

<pre><code>if sys.version_info &lt; (2, 4):
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>if u start your script by clicking it then change py filetype to use older version of python. If you are doing it from command line in short periods use c:\python2.5\python.exe yourscript.py</p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>As noted above, syntax errors occur at compile time, not at run time.  While Python is an "interpreted language", Python code is not actually directly interpreted; it's compiled to byte code, which is then interpreted.  There is a compile step that happens when a module is imported (if there is no already-compiled version available in the form of a .pyc or .pyd file) and that's when you're getting your error, not (quite exactly) when your code is running.  </p>

<p>You can put off the compile step and make it happen at run time for a single line of code, if you want to, by using eval, as noted above, but I personally prefer to avoid doing that, because it causes Python to perform potentially unnecessary run-time compilation, for one thing, and for another, it creates what to me feels like code clutter.  (If you want, you can generate code that generates code that generates code - and have an absolutely fabulous time modifying and debugging that in 6 months from now.)  So what I would recommend instead is something more like this:</p>

<pre><code>import sys
if sys.hexversion &lt; 0x02060000:
    from my_module_2_5 import thisFunc, thatFunc, theOtherFunc
else:
    from my_module import thisFunc, thatFunc, theOtherFunc
</code></pre>

<p>.. which I would do even if I only had one function that used newer syntax and it was very short.  (In fact I would take every reasonable measure to minimize the number and size of such functions.  I might even write a function like ifTrueAElseB(cond, a, b) with that single line of syntax in it.)</p>

<p>Another thing that might be worth pointing out (that I'm a little amazed no one has pointed out yet) is that while earlier versions of Python did not support code like</p>

<pre><code>value = 'yes' if MyVarIsTrue else 'no'
</code></pre>

<p>..it did support code like</p>

<pre><code>value = MyVarIsTrue and 'yes' or 'no'
</code></pre>

<p>That was the old way of writing ternary expressions.  I don't have Python 3 installed yet, but as far as I know, that "old" way still works to this day, so you can decide for yourself whether or not it's worth it to conditionally use the new syntax, if you need to support the use of older versions of Python.</p>
<br /><b>#10</b><br /><p>Although the question is:
How do I get control early enough to issue an error message and exit?</p>

<p>The question that I answer is:
How do I get control early enough to issue an error message before starting the app?</p>

<p>I can answer it a lot differently then the other posts.
Seems answers so far are trying to solve your question from within Python.</p>

<p>I say, do version checking before launching Python. I see your path is Linux or unix.
However I can only offer you a Windows script. I image adapting it to linux scripting syntax wouldn't be too hard.</p>

<p>Here is the DOS script with version 2.7:</p>

<pre><code>@ECHO OFF
REM see http://ss64.com/nt/for_f.html
FOR /F "tokens=1,2" %%G IN ('"python.exe -V 2&gt;&amp;1"') DO ECHO %%H | find "2.7" &gt; Nul
IF NOT ErrorLevel 1 GOTO Python27
ECHO must use python2.7 or greater
GOTO EOF
:Python27
python.exe tern.py
GOTO EOF
:EOF
</code></pre>

<p>This does not run any part of your application and therefore will not raise a Python Exception. It does not create any temp file or add any OS environment variables. And it doesn't end your app to an exception due to different version syntax rules. That's three less possible security points of access.</p>

<p>The "FOR /F" line is the key.
    FOR /F "tokens=1,2" %%G IN ('"python.exe -V 2>&amp;1"') DO ECHO %%H | find "2.7" > Nul</p>
