<h3>Question (ID-4950872):</h3><h2>How do Google App Engine Task Queues work?</h2><p>I'm confused about Task execution using queues.  I've read the documentation and I thought I understood bucket_size and rate, but when I send 20 Tasks to a queue set to 5/h, size 5, all 20 Tasks execute one after the other as quickly as possible, finishing in less than 1 minute.</p>

<pre><code>deferred.defer(spam.cookEggs, 
               egg_keys, 
               _queue="tortoise")  

- name: tortoise
  rate: 5/h  
  bucket_size: 5  
</code></pre>

<p>What I want is whether I create 10 or 100 Tasks, I only want 5 of them to run per hour.  So it would take 20 Tasks approximately 4 hours to complete.  I want their execution spread out.</p>

<h3>UPDATE</h3>

<p>The problem was I assumed that when running locally, that Task execution rate rules were followed, but that is not the case.  You cannot test execution rates locally.  When I deployed to production, the rate and bucket size I had set executed as I expected.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-2):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Execution rates are not honored by the app_devserver. This issue should not occur in production.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You want to set <code>bucket_size</code> to 1, or else you'll have "bursts" of queued activity like you saw there.</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/queue.html" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>bucket_size</p>
  
  <p>Limits the burstiness of the queue's
  processing, i.e. a higher bucket size
  allows bigger spikes in the queue's
  execution rate. For example, consider
  a queue with a rate of 5/s and a
  bucket size of 10. If that queue has
  been inactive for some time (allowing
  its "token bucket" to fill up), and 20
  tasks are suddenly enqueued, it will
  be allowed to execute 10 tasks
  immediately. But in the following
  second, only 5 more tasks will be able
  to be executed because the token
  bucket has been depleted and is
  refilling at the specified rate of
  5/s.</p>
