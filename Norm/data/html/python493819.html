<h3>Question (ID-493819):</h3><h2>Python join, why is it string.join(list) instead of list.join(string)?</h2><p>This has always confused me. It seems like this would be nicer:</p>

<pre><code>my_list = ["Hello", "world"]
print my_list.join("-")
# Produce: "Hello-world"
</code></pre>

<p>Than this:</p>

<pre><code>my_list = ["Hello", "world"]
print "-".join(my_list)
# Produce: "Hello-world"
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a specific reason it does it like this?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-5):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>It's because any iterable can be joined, not just lists, but the result and the "joiner" are always strings.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Because the <code>join()</code> method is in the string class, instead of the list class?</p>

<p>I agree it looks funny.</p>

  <p><strong>Historical note.</strong> When I first learned
  Python, I expected join to be a method
  of a list, which would take the
  delimiter as an argument. Lots of
  people feel the same way, and there’s
  a story behind the join method. Prior
  to Python 1.6, strings didn’t have all
  these useful methods. There was a
  separate string module which contained
  all the string functions; each
  function took a string as its first
  argument. The functions were deemed
  important enough to put onto the
  strings themselves, which made sense
  for functions like lower, upper, and
  split. But many hard-core Python
  programmers objected to the new join
  method, arguing that it should be a
  method of the list instead, or that it
  shouldn’t move at all but simply stay
  a part of the old string module (which
  still has lots of useful stuff in it).
  I use the new join method exclusively,
  but you will see code written either
  way, and if it really bothers you, you
  can use the old string.join function
  instead.</p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I agree that it's counterintuitive at first, but there's a good reason. Join can't be a method of a list because:</p>

<ul>
<li>it must work for different iterables too (tuples, generators, etc.) </li>
<li>it must have different behavior between different types of strings.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are actually two join methods (Python 3.0):</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; b"".join
&lt;built-in method join of bytes object at 0x00A46800&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; "".join
&lt;built-in method join of str object at 0x00A28D40&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If join was a method of a list, then it would have to inspect its arguments to decide which one of them to call. And you can't join byte and str together, so the way they have it now makes sense. </p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Primarily because the result of a <code>someString.join()</code> is a string.</p>

<p>The sequence (list or tuple or whatever) doesn't appear in the result, just a string.  Because the result is a string, it makes sense as a method of a string.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Think of it as the natural orthogonal operation to split.</p>

<p>I understand why it is applicable to anything iterable and so can't easily be implemented <em>just</em> on list.</p>

<p>For readability, I'd like to see it in the language but I don't think that is actually feasible - if iterability were an interface then it could be added to the interface but it is just a convention and so there's no central way to add it to the set of things which are iterable.</p>
