Question (ID-879173): How to ignore deprecation warnings in Python I keep getting this : 

 DeprecationWarning: integer argument expected, got float
 

 How do I make this message go away? Is there a way to avoid warnings in Python? 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 I Googled and found : 

 #!/usr/bin/env python -W ignore::DeprecationWarning
 

 If you're on Windows: pass -W ignore::DeprecationWarning as an argument to Python. 

 (But resolving the issue may be a better course of action... casting to int is not hard.) 
 #1 You should just fix your code but just in case, 

 import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")
 
 #2 I had these: 

 
 /home/eddyp/virtualenv/lib/python2.6/site-packages/Twisted-8.2.0-py2.6-linux-x86_64.egg/twisted/persisted/sob.py:12:
 DeprecationWarning: the md5 module is
 deprecated; use hashlib instead 
 import os, md5, sys 
 
 /home/eddyp/virtualenv/lib/python2.6/site-packages/Twisted-8.2.0-py2.6-linux-x86_64.egg/twisted/python/filepath.py:12: DeprecationWarning: the sha module is
 deprecated; use the hashlib module
 instead import sha 
 

 Fixed it with: 

 import warnings

with warnings.catch_warnings():
 warnings.filterwarnings("ignore",category=DeprecationWarning)
 import md5, sha

yourcode()
 

 Now you still get all the other DeprecationWarnings, but not the ones caused by import md5, sha 
 #3 I found the cleanest way to do this (especially on windows) is by adding the following to C:\Python26\Lib\site-packages\sitecustomize.py: 

 import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", category=DeprecationWarning)
 

 Note that I had to create this file. Of course, change the path to python if yours is different. 
 #4 Convert the argument to int. It's as simple as 

 int(argument)
 
 #5 Pass the correct arguments? :P 

 On the more serious note, you can pass the argument -Wi::DeprecationWarning on the command line to the interpreter to ignore the deprecation warnings. 
 #6 Not to beat you up about it but you are being warned that what you are doing will likely stop working when you next upgrade python. Convert to int and be done with it. 

 BTW. You can also write your own warnings handler. Just assign a function that does nothing.
