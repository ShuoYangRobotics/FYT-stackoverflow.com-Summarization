Question (ID-534839): How to create a GUID in Python How do I create a GUID in Python that is platform independent? I hear there is a method using ActivePython on Windows but it's Windows only because it uses COM. Is there a method using plain Python? 
 Answers (Total-2): #0 If you're using Python 2.5 or later, the uuid module is already included with the Python standard distribution. 

 Ex: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; import uuid
&gt;&gt;&gt; uuid.uuid1()
UUID('5a35a426-f7ce-11dd-abd2-0017f227cfc7')
 
 #1 "The uuid module, in Python 2.5 and up, provides RFC compliant UUID
generation. See the module docs and the RFC for details."
