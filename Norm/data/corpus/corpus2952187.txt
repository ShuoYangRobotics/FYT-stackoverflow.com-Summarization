Question (ID-2952187): Getting "Error loading MySQLdb module: No module named MySQLdb" - have tried previously posted solutions This is a much discussed issue for OSX 10.6 users, but I haven't been able to find a solution that works. Here's my setup: 

 Python 2.6.1 64bit
Django 1.2.1
MySQL 5.1.47 osx10.6 64bit 

 I create a virtualenvwrapper with --no-site-packages, then installed Django. When I activate the virtualenv and run python manage.py syncdb, I get this error: 

 Traceback (most recent call last):

 I've also installed the MySQL for Python adapter, but to no avail (maybe I installed it improperly?). 

 Anyone dealt with this before? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 I had the same error and easy_install / pip install MySQL-python fixed it. 
 #1 running ubuntu, had to do sudo apt-get install python-mysqldb 
 #2 This issue was the result of an incomplete / incorrect installation of the MySQL for Python adapter. Specifically, I had to edit the path to the mysql_config file to point to /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config - discussed in greater detail in this article: http://dakrauth.com/blog/entry/python-and-django-setup-mac-os-x-leopard/ 
 #3 I had the same problem on OSX 10.6.6. But just a simple easy_install mysql-python on terminal did not solve it as another hiccup followed: 

 error: command 'gcc-4.2' failed with exit status 1 . 

 Apparently, this issue arises after upgrading from XCode3 (which is natively shipped with OSX 10.6) to XCode4. This newer ver removes support for building ppc arch. If its the same case, try doing as follows before easy_install mysql-python 

 sudo bash
export ARCHFLAGS='-arch i386 -arch x86_64'
rm -r build
python setup.py build
python setup.py install
 

 Many thanks to Ned Deily for this solution. Check here 
 #4 Back to the original problem. Your on a Mac (not bloody Ubuntu!), and seemingly can install Python MySQLdb but get a sock error.
It seems Python / MySQLdb insists on using /tmp/mysql.sock no matter what you do, when in fact your mysql.sock file probably lives elsewhere (eg. /var/mysql/mysql.sock) 

 In your settings.py file, point HOST to the actual MySQL sock file you're using. 

 Another option is to simply make a link: 

 ln -s /var/mysql/mysql.sock /tmp/mysql.sock
 

 Not that nice, bit of a workaround, but seems to do the job. Note, you'll lose this when you logoff, so adjusting your settings.py file is a better option. 

 Ideally, MySQLdb could have its sock file adjusted from /tmp/mysql.sock, but I can't find a way to do that. 
 #5 Adding to other answers, the following helped me finish the installation mysql-python: 

 virtualenv, mysql-python, pip: anyone know how? 

 On Ubuntu... 

 apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev
apt-get install python-dev
pip install mysql-python
 

 Don't forget to add 'sudo' to the begging of commands if you don't have the proper permissions.
