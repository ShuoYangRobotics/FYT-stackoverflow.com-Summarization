Question (ID-4750806): How to install pip on windows? pip is a replacement for easy_install. But I will install pip using easy_install on Windows. Is there a better way? 

 Edit: 

 This also seems to work: 

 
 Download the last easy installer for Windows that fits your installed python version: (download the .exe at the bottom of http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools ). Install it. 
 Add c:\Python2x\Scripts to the Windows path 
 Open a new (!) DOS prompt. From there run easy_install pip 
 
 Answers (Total-3): #0 As you mentioned pip doesn't include an independent installer, but you can install it easily with its predecessor easy_install. 

 So: 

 
 Download the last pip version from here: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip#downloads 
 Uncompress it 
 Download the last easy installer for Windows: (download the .exe at the bottom of http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools ). Install it. 
 go to the uncompressed pip directory and: python setup.py install 
 Add your python c:\Python2x\Scripts to the path 
 

 You are done. 

 Now you can use pip install package to easily install packages as in Linux :) 
 #1 When I have to use Windows, I use ActivePython, which automatically adds everything to your PATH and includes a package manager called PyPM which provides binary package management making it faster and simpler to install packages. 

 pip and easy_install aren't exactly the same thing, so there are some things you can get through pip but not easy_install and vice versa . 

 My recommendation is that you get ActivePython Community Edition and don't worry about the huge hassle of getting everything set up for Python on Windows. Then, you can just use pypm . 
 #2 To install pip globally on Python 2.x, easy_install appears to be the best solution as Adri√°n states. 

 However the installation instructions for pip recommend using virtualenv since every virtualenv has pip installed in it automatically. This does not require root access or modify your system Python installation. 

 Installing virtualenv still requires easy_install though.
