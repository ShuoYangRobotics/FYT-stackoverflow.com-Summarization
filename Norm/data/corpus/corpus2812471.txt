Question (ID-2812471): Is there a python equivalent of Ruby's 'rvm'? Q: Do we have anything functionally equivalent in Python to the Ruby version manager 'rvm' ? 

 

 ( RVM lets you easily switch completely between different versions of the ruby interpreter and different sets of gems (modules). Everything concerning download-build-install-switch of interpreter(-s) and gems gets taken care of by invoking rvm. It is all run under your regular user account.)

 #1 Yes, it is virtualenv along with virtualenvwrapper . 

 update: you may install both at once with virtualenv burrito . 
 #2 Optionally, if you're using Macports you can use python_select .
Install python_select with: 

 $ sudo port install python_select
 

 Assuming python 2.6 and 2.5 have bee installed via Macports you can switch pythons like so: 

 $ sudo python_select python25
=&gt; Selecting version "python25" for python
$ python --version
=&gt; 2.5.5
$ sudo python_select python26
=&gt; Selecting version "python26" for python
$ python --version
=&gt; 2.6.6
