Question (ID-1171584): How can I parse JSON in Google App Engine? I'd like to parse a JSON string into an object under Google App Engine (python). What do you recommend? Something to encode/stringify would be nice too. Is what you recommend built in, or a library that I have to include in my app? Is it secure? Thanks. 
 Answers (Total-5): #0 Consider using Django's json lib , which is included with GAE. 

 from django.utils import simplejson as json

# load the object from a string
obj = json.loads( string )
 

 The link above has examples of Django's serializer, and here's the link for simplejson's documentation . 

 If you're looking at storing Python class instances or objects (as opposed to compositions of lists, strings, numbers, and dictionaries), you probably want to look at pickle . 

 I hope that helps. 

 Incidentally, to get Django 1.0 (instead of Django 0.96) running on GAE, you can use the following call in your main.py, per this article : 

 from google.appengine.dist import use_library
use_library('django', '1.0')
 

 

 Note: 
Obviously, if GAE moves to Python 2.6 or higher, you can simply import json . 
 #1 Include the simplejson library with your app? 
 #2 Google is currently using Python 2.5 on Google App Engine. When/if google upgrades GAE to python 2.6, you can do the following: 

 import json
out_json = json.dumps(in_dictionary_vals)
 
 #3 If you're using Python2.6 or greater, I've used with success the built-in json .load function. Otherwise, simplejson works on 2.4 without dependencies. 
 #4 Look at the python section of json.org . The standard library support for JSON started at python 2.6, which I believe is newer than what the app engine provides. Maybe one of the other options listed?
