Question (ID-320929): Currency formatting in Python I am looking to format a number like 188518982.18 to Â£188,518,982.18 using Python. 

 How can I do this? 

 Cheers 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 See the locale module. 

 This does currency (and date) formatting. 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; import locale
&gt;&gt;&gt; locale.setlocale( locale.LC_ALL, '' )
'English_United States.1252'
&gt;&gt;&gt; locale.currency( 188518982.18 )
'$188518982.18'
&gt;&gt;&gt; locale.currency( 188518982.18, grouping=True )
'$188,518,982.18'
 
 #1 My locale settings seemed incomplete, so I had too look beyond this SO answer and found:

 OS-independent 

 Just wanted to share here. 
 #2 New in 2.7 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '{:20,.2f}'.format(18446744073709551616.0)
'18,446,744,073,709,551,616.00'

 #3 Oh, that's an interesting beast. 

 I've spent considerable time of getting that right, there are three main issues that differs from locale to locale:
 - currency symbol and direction
 - thousand separator
 - decimal point 

 I've written my own rather extensive implementation of this which is part of the kiwi python framework, check out the LGPL:ed source here: 

 http://svn.async.com.br/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/kiwi/trunk/kiwi/currency.py?view=markup 

 The code is slightly Linux/Glibc specific, but shouldn't be too difficult to adopt to windows or other unixes. 

 Once you have that installed you can do the following: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; from kiwi.datatypes import currency
&gt;&gt;&gt; v = currency('10.5').format()
 

 Which will then give you: 

 '$10.50'
 

 or 

 '10,50 kr'
 

 Depending on the currently selected locale. 

 The main point this post has over the other is that it will work with older versions of python. locale.currency was introduced in python 2.5. 
 #4 I've come to look at the same thing and found python-money not really used it yet but maybe a mix of the two would be good 
 #5 If you are using OSX and have yet to set your locale module setting this first answer will not work you will receive the following error: 

 Traceback (most recent call last):File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/locale.py", line 221, in currency
raise ValueError("Currency formatting is not possible using "ValueError: Currency formatting is not possible using the 'C' locale.
 

 To remedy this you will have to do use the following: 

 locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, 'en_US')
