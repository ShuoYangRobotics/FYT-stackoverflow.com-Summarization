Question (ID-323424): py2exe fails to generate an executable I am using python 2.6 on XP. I have just installed py2exe, and I can successfully create a simple hello.exe from a hello.py. However, when I try using py2exe on my real program, py2exe produces a few information messages but fails to generate anything in the dist folder. 

 My setup.py looks like this: 

 from distutils.core import setup
import py2exe

setup(console=['ServerManager.py'])
 

 and the py2exe output looks like this: 

 python setup.py py2exe
running py2exe
creating C:\DevSource\Scripts\ServerManager\build
creating C:\DevSource\Scripts\ServerManager\build\bdist.win32
 ...
 ...
creating C:\DevSource\Scripts\ServerManager\dist

 ...
 ...
creating python loader for extension 'bz2' (C:\Python26\DLLs\bz2.pyd -&gt; bz2.pyd)
*** finding dlls needed ***
 

 py2exe seems to have found all my imports (though I was a bit surprised to see win32 mentioned, as I am not explicitly importing it). Also, my program starts up quite happily with this command: 

 python ServerManager.py
 

 Clearly I am doing something fundamentally wrong, but in the absence of any error messages from py2exe I have no idea what. 
 Answers (Total-10): #0 I've discovered that py2exe works just fine if I comment out the part of my program that uses wxPython. Also, when I use py2exe on the 'simple' sample that comes with its download (i.e. in Python26\Lib\site-packages\py2exe\samples\simple), I get this error message: 

 *** finding dlls needed ***
error: MSVCP90.dll: No such file or directory
 

 So something about wxPython makes py2exe think I need a Visual Studio 2008 DLL. I don't have VS2008, and yet my program works perfectly well as a directory of Python modules. I found a copy of MSVCP90.DLL on the web, installed it in Python26/DLLs, and py2exe now works fine. 

 I still don't understand where this dependency has come from, since I can run my code perfectly okay without py2exe. It's also annoying that py2exe didn't give me an error message like it did with the test_wx.py sample. 

 Further update: When I tried to run the output from py2exe on another PC, I discovered that it needed to have MSVCR90.DLL installed; so if your target PC hasn't got Visual C++ 2008 already installed, I recommend you download and install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package. 
 #1 I put this in all my setup.py scripts: 

 distutils.core.setup(
 options = {
  "py2exe": {
   "dll_excludes": ["MSVCP90.dll"]
  }
 },
 ...
)
 

 This keeps py2exe quiet, but you still need to make sure that dll is on the user's machine. 
 #2 It looks like this is only a dependency for Python 2.6. I wasn't getting this error under 2.5, but after the upgrade I am. 

 This email thread has some background for why the problem exists and how to fix it: 
 http://www.nabble.com/py2exe,-Py26,-wxPython-and-dll-td20556399.html 

 I didn't want to have to install the vcredist. My application currently requires no installation and can be run by non-administrators, which is behavior I don't want to lose. So I followed the suggestions in the links and got the necessary Microsoft.VC90.CRT.manifest and msvcr90.dll by installing Python "for this user only". I also needed msvcp90.dll that I found in the WinSxS folder of an "all users" Python 2.6 install. Since I already had two of the three, I included msvcm90.dll to prevent future errors though I didn't get any immediate errors when I left it out. I put the manifest and the three DLLs in the libs folder used by my frozen application. 

 The trick I had to perform was including an additional copy of the manifest and msvcr90.dll in the root of my application folder next to by py2exe generated executable. This copy of the DLL is used to bootstrap the application, but then it appears to only look in the libs folder. 

 Hopefully that discovery helps someone else out. 

 Also, I had the same problem with having py2exe log a real error message. Then I realized that stderr wasn't getting redirected into my log file. Add "> build.log 2>&amp;1" on the command line where you invoke py2exe. 
 #3 wxPython has nothing to do with it. Before Python 2.6, Python used Visual Studio 2003 as their Windows compiler. Beginning with 2.6, they switched to Visual Studio 2008, which requires a manifest file in some situations. This has been well documented. See the following links: 

 http://wiki.wxpython.org/py2exe 

 http://py2exe.org/index.cgi/Tutorial#Step52 

 Also, if you're creating a wxPython application with py2exe, then you want to set the windows parameter, NOT the console one. Maybe my tutorial will help you:

 #4 Just for your info, for me it worked to copy the files 

 Microsoft.VC90.CRT.manifest
msvcr90.dll 

 into the directory with the .exe on the user's machine (who has no python or VC redistributable installed). 

 Thanks for all the hints here! 
 #5 The output says you're using WX. Try running py2exe with your script specified as a GUI app instead of console. If I'm not mistaken, that tends to cause problems with py2exe. 
 #6 我英文不太好。。。不好意思
 我也遇到这个问题了。。。google和live search得到的都是英文的
 没办法 我只有看看了。。。
  但是我还是看不懂
 能用简洁的语言写出来吗？？？ 
 #7 我的wxpython app也遇到了這樣的問題，采用Bill的方式解決了該問題。thanks bill 

 setup.py文件內容如下： 

 coding=utf-8 

 from distutils.core import setup
import py2exe 

 setup(windows=['main.py'],
   options = {
   "py2exe":{"dll_excludes":["MSVCP90.dll"]}}) 
 #8 At the py2exe Tutorial http://www.py2exe.org/index.cgi/Tutorial 

 I read: 

 Also note that despite all the above, py2exe will complain that it cannot find MSVCP90.dll. You must edit your setup.py to add the path to the dlls to the sys.path, e.g. 

 sys.path.append("C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\\VC\\redist\\x86\\Microsoft.VC90.CRT")
 

 It's buried right at the bottom. 

 GaJ 
 #9 import sys 

 sys.path.append('c:/Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0/VC/redist/x86/Microsoft.VC90.CRT')
