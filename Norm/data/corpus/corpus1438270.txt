Question (ID-1438270): Installing Python Imaging Library (PIL) on Snow Leopard with updated Python 2.6.2 I have a fresh install (started with a wiped drive) of Snow Leopard with the developer tools installed during the Snow Leopard installation. I then installed Python 2.6.2, replacing the Snow Leopard default python 2.6.1. I've tried to install PIL by (1) easy_install (2) pip and (3) downloading source and running "python setup.py build" manually. All yield the same error (link to pip log: http://drop.io/gi2bgw6 ). I've seen others have had success installing PIL using the Snow Leopard default python 2.6.1, so I'm not sure why I'm having so much trouble getting it to work with 2.6.2. Any help would be greatly appreciated! 
 Answers (Total-10): #0 The python.org Python was built with an earlier gcc. Try using gcc-4.0 instead of SL's default of 4.2: 

 export CC=/usr/bin/gcc-4.0
 

 See similar problem here . 

 That gets past the stdarg problem. You may then run into later build problems with various dependent libraries. 

 BTW, gcc-4.0 and gcc-4.2 are both included with Snow Leopard's Xcode 3 so no additional installs are needed. 

 UPDATED 2011-05: Note, that the newer Xcode 4 , released for experimental use with 10.6 and expected to be standard with 10.7, no longer includes PPC support so, if you install Xcode 4, this suggestion will not work. Options include using the newer 64-bit/32-bin Python 2.7.x installers from python.org or installing a newer Python 2.6 and PIL and the various 3rd-party libs using MacPorts, Homebrew, or Fink. 
 #1 The problem I ran into was that PIL was being compiled against PowerPC architecture (-arch ppc). 

 Do this before setup/build/compile: 

 export ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386"
 

 (Assuming you're on i386) 
 #2 Modified Answer 

 Here are the steps that I took to successfully install PIL on Mac OS X 10.6 (without using MacPorts or Fink). 

 
 Install readline 

 cd ~/src
curl -O ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/pub/bash/readline-6.0.tar.gz
tar -xvzf readline-6.0.tar.gz
cd readline-6.0
./configure 
make 
sudo make install
 
 Install gbdm 

 cd ~/src
curl -O ftp://mirror.anl.gov/pub/gnu/gdbm/gdbm-1.8.3.tar.gz
tar -xvzf gbdm-1.8.3.tar.gz
cd gdbm-1.8.3
# Need to modify Makefile.in
perl -pi -e 's/BINOWN = bin/BINOWN = root/' Makefile.in
perl -pi -e 's/BINGRP = bin/BINGRP = wheel/' Makefile.in
./configure
make
sudo make install
 
 Compile the latest Python 2.6.2+ from the Mercurial Repo 

 cd ~/development
hg clone http://code.python.org/hg/branches/release2.6-maint/ python-release2.6-maint.hg
cd python-release2.6-main.hg
./configure --enable-framework MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.6
make
sudo make frameworkinstall
 

 Note : I did receive the following errors after running make . However, I continued on as I wasn't worried about missing these modules, and I was able to successfully install PIL. 

 Failed to find the necessary bits to build these modules:
_bsddb    dl     imageop   
linuxaudiodev  ossaudiodev  spwd   
sunaudiodev           
To find the necessary bits, look in setup.py in detect_modules() for the module's name.


Failed to build these modules:
Nav             


running build_scripts
 
 Update .bash_profile for the new Python 2.6.2+ and for virtualenvwrapper 

 # Set PATH for MacPython 2.6 if Python2.6 is installed
if [ -x /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/bin/python2.6 ]; then
 PATH="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/bin:${PATH}"
 export PATH
fi


# MDR April 23, 2009: Added for virtualenvwrapper
if [ -x /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/bin/virtualenvwrapper_bashrc ]; then
 export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs
 export PIP_VIRTUALENV_BASE=$WORKON_HOME
 source /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/bin/virtualenvwrapper_bashrc
fi
 
 Install easy_install, pip, virtualenv, and virtualenvwrapper for Python 2.6.2+ 

 curl -O http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py
sudo python ez_setup.py
sudo easy_install pip
sudo easy_install virtualenv
sudo easy_install virtualenvwrapper
 
 Create a virtualenv and then use pip to install PIL 

 mkvirtualenv pil-test
cdvirtualenv
easy_install pip
pip install http://effbot.org/downloads/Imaging-1.1.6.tar.gz
 
 

 Note : I was not able to install PIL using pip install pil , so I installed from the URL as shown above. 

 Original Answer 

 From what I can see in your pip-log.txt file it appears that you installed Python 2.6.2 using the Mac Installer Disk Image from Python.org released on April 16, 2009. Can you confirm this? 

 From the pip log, gcc failed with exit status 1. The offending gcc command from your pip log is as follows: 

 gcc -arch ppc -arch i386 -isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common -dynamic -DNDEBUG -g -O3 -DHAVE_LIBJPEG -DHAVE_LIBZ -I/System/Library/Frameworks/Tcl.framework/Headers -I/System/Library/Frameworks/Tk.framework/Headers -IlibImaging -I/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/include -I/usr/local/include -I/usr/include -I/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/include/python2.6 -c _imaging.c -o build/temp.macosx-10.3-fat-2.6/_imaging.o
 

 This appears to be a problem related to Snow Leopard changing the default value for the -arch flag from i386 to x86-64 according to Ronald Oussoren in Message 92083 of Python Issue 6802 . There is a patch available Python 2.6.2, but it has not been integrated into the Mac Installer Disk Image. 

 Your best solution that doesn't involve MacPorts or Fink would probably be to compile and install Python from the 2.6 release branch from either the Mercurial Python Repository or the Subversion Python Repository . According to Message 92315 of Issue 6802 , Ronald Oussoren fixed this in Revision r74686 . 

 I've been seeing similar errors using Python 2.6.2 installed from the Mac Disk Image while trying to then install Fabric in a virtualenv, so I plan to compile and install from the 2.6 release maintenance branch. If you want, I'll update when successful. 
 #3 10.6 Snow Leopard install PIL without the hassle and without keeping MacPorts :) 
 
Step 1: Install MacPorts 
Step 2: sudo port install py26-pil 
Step 3: mv /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/site-packages/* /Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/ 
Step 4: Uninstall MacPorts 
 
Best of both worlds? 
 #4 IT seems to me that the "No such file" is conjunction with stdarg.h is the most interesting error. There seems to be a header file missing. I don't know how to make sure it's installed on OS X, so this only half an answer, sorry about that, but maybe it pushes you in the right direction. 
 #5 I found a simpler method.
sudo port install python26
sudo port install python_select 

 Then use python_select set python26 as default. 

 Then just install PIL as normal. 
 #6 I was able to get PIP installed with SL's Python using these instructions: 

 http://jetfar.com/libjpeg-and-python-imaging-pil-on-snow-leopard/ 
 #7 Do you have XCode (comes on the Snow Leopard disc) installed? There are some key components (most notably GCC ) that need to be installed which XCode handles for you. 
 #8 May be you should try pre-build universal binaries from pythonmac site 

 http://pythonmac.org/packages/py25-fat/index.html 

 These are for python2.5 , with python2.5 included(so may or may not be usable for you), I have been using it since I had problem using self build PIL with py2app. 
 #9 Following steps worked for me: 

 $ brew install pip
$ export ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch x86_64"
$ pip install pil
