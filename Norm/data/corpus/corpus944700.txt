Question (ID-944700): How to check for NaN in python? float('nan') results in a thingy simply called nan. But how do I check for it? Should be very easy, but i cannot find it. 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 math.isnan() 

 
 Checks if the float x is a NaN (not a number). NaNs are part of the IEEE 754 standards. Operation like but not limited to inf * 0, inf / inf or any operation involving a NaN, e.g. nan * 1, return a NaN. 
 
 New in version 2.6. 
 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; import math
&gt;&gt;&gt; x=float('nan')
&gt;&gt;&gt; math.isnan(x)
True
&gt;&gt;&gt;
 
 #1 The usual way to test for a NaN is to see if it's equal to itself: 

 def isNaN(num):
 return num != num
 
 #2 numpy.isnan(float) tells you if it's NaN or not in Python 2.5 
 #3 math.isnan() 

 or compare the number to itself. NaN is always != NaN, otherwise (e.g. if it is a number) the comparison should succeed. 
 #4 Another method if you're stuck on &lt;2.6, you don't have numpy, and you don't have IEEE 754 support: 

 def isNaN(x):
 return str(x) == str(1e400*0)
 
 #5 With python &lt; 2.6 I ended up with 

 def isNaN(x):
 return str(float(x)).lower() == 'nan'
 

 This works for me with python 2.5.1 on a Solaris 5.9 box and with python 2.6.5 on Ubuntu 10 
 #6 Here is how: 

 def isNaN(x):
 try: float(x)
 except ValueError: return True
 return False
