Question (ID-227459): ASCII value of a character in python How do I get the ASCII value of a character as an int in python? 
 Answers (Total-3): #0 From here : 

 
 function ord() would get the int value
 of the char. and in case you want to
 convert back after playing with the
 number, function chr() does the trick 
 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; ord('a')
97
&gt;&gt;&gt; chr(97)
'a'
&gt;&gt;&gt; chr(ord('a') + 3)
'd'
&gt;&gt;&gt;
 

 There is also a unichr function, returning the Unicode character whose ordinal is the unichr argument: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; unichr(97)
u'a'
&gt;&gt;&gt; unichr(1234)
u'\u04d2'
 
 #1 Note that ord() doesn't give you the ASCII value per se; it gives you the numeric value of the character in whatever encoding it's in. Therefore the result of ord('ä') can be 228 if you're using Latin-1, or it can raise a TypeError if you're using UTF-8. It can even return the Unicode codepoint instead if you pass it a unicode: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; ord(u'あ')
12354
