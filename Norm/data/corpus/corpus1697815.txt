Question (ID-1697815): How do you convert a python time.struct_time object into a datetime object? How do you convert a python time.struct_time object into a datetime.datetime object? I have a library that provides the first one and a second library that wants the second one... 
 Answers (Total-2): #0 Use time.mktime() to convert the time tuple (in localtime) into seconds since the Epoch, then use datetime.fromtimestamp() to get the datetime object. 

 from time import mktime
from datetime import datetime

dt = datetime.fromtimestamp(mktime(struct))
 
 #1 Like this: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; structTime = time.localtime()
&gt;&gt;&gt; datetime.datetime(*structTime[:6])
datetime.datetime(2009, 11, 8, 20, 32, 35)
