Question (ID-189555): How to use Python to login to a webpage and retrieve cookies for later usage? I want to download and parse webpage using python, but to access it I need a couple of cookies set. Therefore I need to login over https to the webpage first. The login moment involves sending two POST params (username, password) to /login.php. During the login request I want to retrieve the cookies from the response header and store them so I can use them in the request to download the webpage /data.php. 

 How would I do this in python (preferably 2.6)? If possible I only want to use builtin modules. 
 Answers (Total-3): #0 import urllib, urllib2, cookielib

username = 'myuser'
password = 'mypassword'

cj = cookielib.CookieJar()
opener = urllib2.build_opener(urllib2.HTTPCookieProcessor(cj))
login_data = urllib.urlencode({'username' : username, 'j_password' : password})
opener.open('http://www.example.com/login.php', login_data)
resp = opener.open('http://www.example.com/hiddenpage.php')
print resp.read()
 

 resp.read() is the straight html of the page you want to open, and you can use opener to view any page using your session cookie. 
 #1 Almost, but resp will just print the file descriptor
try print resp.readLines()
