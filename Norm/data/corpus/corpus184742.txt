Question (ID-184742): What is a good CMS written in Python (and not Plone)? I've been doing CMS sites for clients using Joomla for a while now, but I've been migrating a lot of my coding over to Python and have been looking for a good CMS solution that's written in Python. 

 Most of what I've seen so far is either Zope based (Plone) or Django based. I'm not totally opposed to something written in a Python framework such as Django, but I don't want to use Zope (seems to me to have too much "bloat" for something like this). 

 Is there anything in the Python community like Joomla? I know I could always "roll my own", but I'd rather use something pre-built (if there is such a thing). 

 Thanks for your time,
Seth 
 Answers (Total-11): #0 The pinax project is a kind of django bundle with some modules to build community sites. It is a good start to build your cms on it. There is a video available presenting it a djangoconf. 

 Feature List: 

 
 openid support 
 email verification 
 password management 
 site announcements 
 a notification framework 
 user-to-user messaging 
 friend invitation (both internal and external to the site) 
 a basic twitter clone 
 oembed support 
 gravatar support 
 interest groups (called tribes) 
 projects with basic task and issue management 
 threaded discussions 
 wikis with multiple markup support 
 blogging 
 bookmarks 
 tagging 
 contact import (from vCard, Google or Yahoo) 
 photo management

 #1 Unfortunately, there's really not a lot of mature CMSes out there for Python. Here are a couple of choices though: 

 
 Skeletonz (still in beta) 
 PyLucid (haven't actually tried them out, but couldn't get past the constant grammatical and spelling errors) (which are probably because it's made by Germans) 
 MoinMoin is very mature, but isn't really made for CMS stuff. With that said, if you spend some time with it, you can mod it to do CMS-like stuff. 
 

 So with that said, your best bet may actually be to roll your own in Django or something similar. 
 #2 Considering this now it looks like the two best contenders are Django CMS 2.0 and Fein CMS. Here's Fein. You'll have to find Django CMS 2 yourself, because I can only post one link. =)

 They're not as complete as drupal, but in contexts where you want to write code alongside a CMS, they may be a better choice than Drupal. 
 #3 I did a similar investigation a while ago, and settled on Plone. It does wrap most of the Zope complexity fairly well, but it continues to seem heavy-weight for what it does. Then again, the functionality offered is fairly substantial, so some trade-off in terms of increased complexity should be expected. 

 I'd recommend giving Plone a go; the unified installer means you can build and run it up very easily (it includes its own version of Python, stuck as it is on 2.4). 

 All that said, if I wanted to build another CMS-based site, I'd go with something non-Python, such as Drupal (PHP). 
 #4 Lighting Fast CMS is a promising new kid on the block. 

 I'm looking forward on its development. 

 LFC is Django based. 
 #5 Take a look at Merengue CMS , is a new django CMS with a lot of features: 

 * Pluggable
* GIS integrated
* Out-of-the-box caching
* Page sorting, Drag and drop, WYSIWYG Editor
* Theming
* Full featured management interface
* Collaborative edition
* i18n. Translation tools (django-inlinetrans,django-transmeta,Transhette)
* South
* pypi
* Extensible data schema. Not hierarchical pages
* Unit tests and selenium test suites
 

 Check the demo site. 
 #6 The code that runs djangoproject.com is good, but not really released as a package. You can grab the source though, and tweak it for your needs. 
 #7 You know, you can use a different back-end with Plone if you don't like Zope.

 #8 Python 

 zope2 + CMS = plone &lt; Zope3 + CMS = Z3Ext 

 ( http://z3ext.net/ ) 
 #9 If you are looking to manage media or podcasts a good python-based CMS solution is MediaCore . It just launched this last week and really looks like a solid content management system. The design is sleek and for organizing, tagging, and managing videos or podcasts it looks like a great solution. 
 #10 It might look a bit oldfashioned but you should give ZMS a try:
