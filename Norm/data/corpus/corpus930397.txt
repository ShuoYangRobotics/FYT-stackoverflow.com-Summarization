Question (ID-930397): How to get the last element of a list? I found many different ways of getting the last element from a list in Python: 

 alist[-1]
alist[len(alist) -1]
 

 How would you do this? 
 Answers (Total-3): #0 someList[-1] is the shortest and most Pythonic. Why complicate things by adding an unnecessary function call in there? 
 #1 You can also do: 

 alist.pop()
 

 It depends on what you want to do with your list because the pop() method will delete the last element. 
 #2 If astr = '' or alist = [] you can also use alist[-1:] if getting an empty string or empty list is preferred over an IndexError.
