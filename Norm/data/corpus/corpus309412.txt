Question (ID-309412): How to setup setuptools for python 2.6 on Windows? Is there any way to install setuptools for python 2.6 in Windows without having an .exe installer? 

 There isn't one built at the moment, and the maintainer of setuptools has stated that it's probable be a while before he'll get to it. 

 Does anyone know of a way to install it anyway? 
 Answers (Total-13): #0 Online Installation (i.e. remain connected to the Internet during the entire installation process) 

 
 Download setuptools-0.6c9.tar.gz 
 Use 7-zip to extract it to a folder(directory) outside your Windows Python installation folder 
 Go the folder (refer step 3) and run ez_setup.py from the corresponding dos (command) prompt 
 Ensure that your PATH includes the appropriate C:\Python2X\Scripts directory 
 

 Second Option: 

 
 Download setuptools-0.6c9.tar.gz 
 Download setuptools-0.6c9-py2.6.egg to a folder(directory) outside your Windows Python installation folder 
 Use 7-zip to extract ez_setup.py in the same folder as setuptools-0.6c9-py2.6.egg 
 Go to the corresponding dos prompt and run python ez_setup.py setuptools-0.6c9-py2.6.egg from the command prompt 
 Ensure that your PATH includes the appropriate C:\Python2X\Scripts directory 
 

 Third Option (assuming that you have Visual Studio 2005 or MinGW on your machine) 

 
 Download setuptools-0.6c9.tar.gz 
 Use 7-zip to extract it to a folder(directory) outside your Windows Python installation folder 
 Go the folder (refer step 3) and run python setup.py install from the corresponding dos (command) prompt 
 

 Please provide feedback. 
 #1 You could download and run http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py . This will download and install setuptools. 
 #2 The Nov. 21 answer didn't work for me. I got it working on my 64 bit Vista machine by following the Method 1 instructions, except for Step 3 I typed: 

 setup.py install 

 So, in summary, I did: 

 
 Download setuptools-0.6c9.tar.gz 
 Use 7-zip to extract it to a folder (directory) outside your Windows Python installation folder 
 At a DOS (command) prompt, cd to your the newly created setuptools-0.6c9 folder and type "setup.py install" (without the quotes). 
 Ensure that your PATH includes the appropriate C:\Python2X\Scripts directory 
 
 #3 I got it working quickly by downloading the source and then running (from the extracted directory): 

 python.exe setup.py bdist_wininst
 

 That builds dist\setuptools-0.6c9.win32.exe , which is exactly the installer you're looking for. 
 #4 I'm able to find the EXE doing google, 

 you can simply download it from following URL, and double click and install.... 

 http://pypi.python.org/packages/2.6/s/setuptools/setuptools-0.6c11.win32-py2.6.exe#md5=1509752c3c2e64b5d0f9589aafe053dc 
 #5 The "first option" (4 steps: download, extract, run, verify PATH) didn't work on my Windows Server 2008 x64 machine with Python 2.6 32 bit installed, nor did it work on my Vista x64 machine with Python 2.6 32 bit installed. 

 The "second option (5 steps: download, extract, extract, run, verify PATH) worked on both Windows Server 2008 x64 and on Windows Vista x64. 

 Thanks a bunch for providing the instructions! 
 #6 Just installed setuptools as follows: 

 
 Downloaded http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/s/setuptools/setuptools-0.6c9.tar.gz#md5=3864c01d9c719c8924c455714492295e , and extracted to a folder outside of my Python installation. 
 command prompt, then cd into that folder. 
 enter python setup.py install 
 

 That will install from the source into your python's site-packages folder and any other steps needed. This was on Windows XP SP2. 
 #7 OP option 1 did not work for me. 

 However doing setup.py install as mentioned by NathanD did do the trick. 

 Maybe that should become option 1?

 #8 My advice is to wait until Python 2.6.2 to use Python 2.6 on Windows. There are still some bugs that make it less than ideal ( this one is particularly nasty ). Personally, I wasn't able to get setuptools working totally well on Vista x64 even after installing from source. Under Python 2.5.4, I haven't had any problems though. 
 #9 Second option worked for me. 

 Two notes: 

 a. After installing, when you using easy_install in vista, do so as administrator. (Right click on your command line shortcut and click "run as administrator"). I had trouble trying to run easy_install without doing that. 

 b. He means use ez_setup from setuptools-0.6c9.tar.gz 
 #10 ActivePython already includes setuptools ( Distribute actually), along with pip and virtualenv. 
 #11 setuptools has been updated: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools/0.6c11 
 #12 The easiest setuptools installation option is to use the pre-packaged Windows Installer. 

 for 32-bit Python on Windows, the official setuptools page has been updated and has windows installers for Python 2.6 and 2.7: 

 
 http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools 
 

 for 64-bit Python on Windows, setuptools Windows installers are available here:
