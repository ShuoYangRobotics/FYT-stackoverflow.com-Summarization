Question (ID-641420): How should I log while using multiprocessing in Python? Right now I have a central module in a framework that spawns multiple processes using the Python 2.6 multiprocessing module . Because it uses multiprocessing , there is module-level multiprocessing-aware log, LOG = multiprocessing.get_logger() . Per the docs , this logger has process-shared locks so that you don't garble things up in sys.stderr (or whatever filehandle) by having multiple processes writing to it simultaneously. 

 The issue I have now is that the other modules in the framework are not multiprocessing-aware. The way I see it, I need to make all dependencies on this central module use multiprocessing-aware logging. That's annoying within the framework, let alone for all clients of the framework. Are there alternatives I'm not thinking of? 
 Answers (Total-9): #0 The only way to deal with this non-intrusively is to spawn each worker process such that its log goes to a different file descriptor (to disk or to pipe.) Ideally, all log entries should be timestamped. Your controller process can then (if using disk files) coalesce the log files at the end of the run (sorting by timestamp) or, if using pipes (recommended approach), coalesce log entries on-the-fly from all pipes into a central log (e.g. periodically select from the pipes' fd's, perform merge-sort on the available log entries, flush to centralized log, repeat.) 
 #1 I just now wrote a log handler of my own that just feeds everything to the parent process via a pipe. I've only been testing it for ten minutes but it seems to work pretty well (note this is hardcoded to RotatingFileHandler, which is my own use case) 

 Updated. This now uses a queue for correct handling of concurrency, and also recovers from errors correctly. I've now been using this in production for several months and the current version below works without issue. 

 from logging.handlers import RotatingFileHandler
import multiprocessing, threading, logging, sys, traceback

class MultiProcessingLog(logging.Handler):
 def __init__(self, name, mode, maxsize, rotate):
  logging.Handler.__init__(self)

  self._handler = RotatingFileHandler(name, mode, maxsize, rotate)
  self.queue = multiprocessing.Queue(-1)

  t = threading.Thread(target=self.receive)
  t.daemon = True
  t.start()

 def setFormatter(self, fmt):
  logging.Handler.setFormatter(self, fmt)
  self._handler.setFormatter(fmt)

 def receive(self):
  while True:
   try:
    record = self.queue.get()
    self._handler.emit(record)
   except (KeyboardInterrupt, SystemExit):
    raise
   except EOFError:
    break
   except:
    traceback.print_exc(file=sys.stderr)

 def send(self, s):
  self.queue.put_nowait(s)

 def _format_record(self, record):
  # ensure that exc_info and args
  # have been stringified. Removes any chance of
  # unpickleable things inside and possibly reduces
  # message size sent over the pipe
  if record.args:
   record.msg = record.msg % record.args
   record.args = None
  if record.exc_info:
   dummy = self.format(record)
   record.exc_info = None

  return record

 def emit(self, record):
  try:
   s = self._format_record(record)
   self.send(s)
  except (KeyboardInterrupt, SystemExit):
   raise
  except:
   self.handleError(record)

 def close(self):
  self._handler.close()
  logging.Handler.close(self)
 
 #2 Yet another alternative might be the various non-file-based logging handlers in the logging package : 

 
 SocketHandler 
 DatagramHandler 
 SyslogHandler 
 

 (and others) 

 This way, you could easily have a logging daemon somewhere that you could write to safely and would handle the results correctly. Eg a simple socket server that just unpickles the message and emits it to its own rotating file handler. 

 The syslog handler would take care of this for you too. Of course, you could use your own instance of syslog not the system one. 
 #3 just publish somewhere your instance of the logger. that way, the other modules and clients can use your API to get the logger without having to import multiprocessing . 
 #4 I also like zzzeek's answer but Andre is correct that a queue is required to prevent garbling. I had some luck with the pipe, but did see garbling which is somewhat expected. Implementing it turned out to be harder than I thought, particularly due to running on Windows, where there are some additional restrictions about global variables and stuff (see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/765129/hows-python-multiprocessing-implemented-on-windows ) 

 But, I finally got it working. This example probably isn't perfect, so comments and suggestions are welcome. It also does not support setting the formatter or anything other than the root logger. Basically, you have to reinit the logger in each of the pool processes with the queue and set up the other attributes on the logger. 

 Again, any suggestions on how to make the code better are welcome. I certainly don't know all the Python tricks yet :-)

 """sample code for logging in subprocesses using multiprocessing

* Little handler magic - The main process uses loggers and handlers as normal.
* Only a simple handler is needed in the subprocess that feeds the queue.
* Original logger name from subprocess is preserved when logged in main
 process.
* As in the other implementations, a thread reads the queue and calls the
 handlers. Except in this implementation, the thread is defined outside of a
 handler, which makes the logger definitions simpler.
* Works with multiple handlers. If the logger in the main process defines
 multiple handlers, they will all be fed records generated by the
 subprocesses loggers.
