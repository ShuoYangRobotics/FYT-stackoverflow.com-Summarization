Question (ID-2051192): What is a Python egg? Doing a quick search of SO, I didn't find anything, but feel free to just redirect me. Basically, I'm new to Python and just trying to understand how it's packages work. Presumably "eggs" are some sort of packaging mechanism, but if someone could give me a quick overview of what role they play and maybe some information on why they're useful and how to create them. 
 Answers (Total-5): #0 same concept as a .jar file in Java, it is a .zip file with some metadata files renamed .egg, for distributing code as bundles.

 Google hit #5: How to create Python egg file 
 #2 As someone who loathes .egg files, I use this to install Python packages that use setuptools: 

 python setup.py install --single-version-externally-managed --root=/
 

 this will install the package in non-egg form. 

 If a package just uses distutils, then: 

 python setup.py install
 

 will suffice. 
 #3 Analogous to Debian .deb archives: code bundle with meta-data to help with the management of the archive e.g. installation, script extraction etc.
