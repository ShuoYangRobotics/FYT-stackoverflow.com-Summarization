Question (ID-70528): Why are Python's 'private' methods not actually private? Python gives us the ability to create 'private' methods and variables within a class by prepending double underscores to the name, like so: *__myPrivateMethod()*. How, then, can one explain this 

 >>> class MyClass:
...  def myPublicMethod(self):
...    print 'public method'
...  def __myPrivateMethod(self):
...    print 'this is private!!'
... 
>>> obj = MyClass()
>>> obj.myPublicMethod()
public method
>>> obj.__myPrivateMethod()
Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "", line 1, in 
AttributeError: MyClass instance has no attribute '__myPrivateMethod'
>>> dir(obj)
['_MyClass__myPrivateMethod', '__doc__', '__module__', 'myPublicMethod']
>>> obj._MyClass__myPrivateMethod()
this is private!!
 

 What's the deal?! 

 I'll explain this a little for those who didn't quite get that. 

 >>> class MyClass:
...  def myPublicMethod(self):
...    print 'public method'
...  def __myPrivateMethod(self):
...    print 'this is private!!'
... 
>>> obj = MyClass()
 

 What I did there is create a class with a public method and a private method and instantiate it. 

 Next, I call its public method. 

 >>> obj.myPublicMethod()
public method
 

 Next, I try and call its private method. 

 >>> obj.__myPrivateMethod()
Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "", line 1, in 
AttributeError: MyClass instance has no attribute '__myPrivateMethod'
 

 Everything looks good here; we're unable to call it. It is, in fact, 'private'. Well, actually it isn't. Running dir() on the object reveals a new magical method that python creates magically for all of your 'private' methods. 

 >>> dir(obj)
['_MyClass__myPrivateMethod', '__doc__', '__module__', 'myPublicMethod']
 

 This new method's name is always an underscore, followed by the class name, followed by the method name. 

 >>> obj._MyClass__myPrivateMethod()
this is private!!
 

 So much for encapsulation, eh? 

 In any case, I'd always heard Python doesn't support encapsulation, so why even try? What gives? 
 Answers (Total-9): #0 The name scrambling is used to ensure that subclasses don't accidentally override the private methods and attributes of their superclasses. It's not designed to prevent deliberate access from outside. 

 For example: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; class Foo(object):
...  def __init__(self):
...   self.__baz = 42
...  def foo(self):
...   print self.__baz
...  
&gt;&gt;&gt; class Bar(Foo):
...  def __init__(self):
...   super(Bar, self).__init__()
...   self.__baz = 21
...  def bar(self):
...   print self.__baz
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = Bar()
&gt;&gt;&gt; x.foo()
42
&gt;&gt;&gt; x.bar()
21
&gt;&gt;&gt; print x.__dict__
{'_Bar__baz': 21, '_Foo__baz': 42}
 

 Of course, it breaks down if two different classes have the same name. 
 #1 From http://www.faqs.org/docs/diveintopython/fileinfo_private.html 

 
 Strictly speaking, private methods are
 accessible outside their class, just
 not easily accessible. Nothing in
 Python is truly private; internally,
 the names of private methods and
 attributes are mangled and unmangled
 on the fly to make them seem
 inaccessible by their given names. You
 can access the __parse method of the
 MP3FileInfo class by the name
 _MP3FileInfo__parse. Acknowledge that this is interesting, then promise to
 never, ever do it in real code.
 Private methods are private for a
 reason, but like many other things in
 Python, their privateness is
 ultimately a matter of convention, not
 force. 
 
 #2 The phrase commonly used is "we're all consenting adults here". By prepending a single underscore (don't expose) or double underscore (hide), you're telling the user of your class that you intend the member to be 'private' in some way. However, you're trusting everyone else to behave responsibly and respect that, unless they have a compelling reason not to (e.g. debuggers, code completion). 

 If you truly must have something that is private, then you can implement it in an extension (e.g. in C for CPython). In most cases, however, you simply learn the Pythonic way of doing things. 
 #3 Example of private function 

 import re
import inspect

class MyClass :

 def __init__(self) :
  pass

 def private_function ( self ) :
  try :
   function_call = inspect.stack()[1][4][0].strip()

   # See if the function_call has "self." in the begining
   matched = re.match( '^self\.', function_call )
   if not matched :
    print 'This is Private Function, Go Away'
    return
  except :
   print 'This is Private Function, Go Away'
   return

  # This is the real Function, only accessible inside class #
  print 'Hey, Welcome in to function'

 def public_function ( self ) :
  # i can call private function from inside the class
  self.private_function()

### End ###
 
 #4 It's not like you absolutly can't get around privateness of members in any language (pointer arithmetics in C++, Reflections in .NET/Java). 

 The point is that you get an error if you try to call the private method by accident. But if you want to shoot yourself in the foot, go ahead and do it. 

 Edit: You don't try to secure your stuff by OO-encapsulation, do you? 
 #5 When I first came form Java to Python i literately HATED this. 

 Today it might just be the one thing I LOVE most about Python. 

 I love being on a platform, where people trust each other, and I don't feel like anybody are forcing me away from anything in my code. In strongly encapsulated languages, if APIs have bugs, a workaround might just be a method call away, but if that method is private, then badluck. In Python they just say, sure, if you've read my code, and think it works, then good luck. :) 
 #6 Similar behavior exists when module attribute names begin with a single underscore (e.g. _foo). 

 Module attributes named as such will not be copied into an importing module when using the from* method, e.g.: 

 from bar import *
 

 However, this is a convention and not a language constraint. These are not private attributes; they can be referenced and manipulated by any importer. Some argue that because of this, Python can not implement true encapsulation. 
 #7 The class.__stuff naming convention lets the programmer know he isn't meant to access __stuff from outside. The name mangling makes it unlikely anyone will do it by accident. 

 True, you still can work around this, it's even easier than in other languages (which BTW also let you do this), but no Python programmer would do this if he cares about encapsulation. 
 #8 Its just one of those language design choices. On some level they are justified. They make it so you need to go pretty far out of your way to try and call the method, and if you really need it that badly, you must have a pretty good reason! Debugging hooks and testing come to mind as possible applications, used responsibly of course.
