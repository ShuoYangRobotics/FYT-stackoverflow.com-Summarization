Question (ID-931092): Reverse a string in Python There is no built in "reverse" function in Python's str object.
What is the best way of implementing this? 

 If supplying a very concise answer, please elaborate on it's
efficiency. Is the str converted to a different object, etc. 
 Answers (Total-2): #0 How about: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; 'hello world'[::-1]
'dlrow olleh'
 

 This is extended slice syntax. It works by doing [begin:end:step] - by leaving begin and end off and specifying a step of -1, it reverses a string. 
 #1 @Paolo's s[::-1] is fastest; a slower approach (maybe more readable, but that's debatable) approach is ''.join(reversed(s)) .
