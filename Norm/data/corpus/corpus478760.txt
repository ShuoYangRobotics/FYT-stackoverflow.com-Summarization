Question (ID-478760): What CMS runs on Google App Engine? Is it possible to deploy any CMS (Content Management System) using Google App Engine? Wikipedia lists 4 Python CMSes and one of them is Django based. 

 Do you know any way to make any of them to work on App Engine? 

 My votes: 

 Python 

 
 GuteCMS (revision 11 10/28/2009) Too simple. Barely usable. 
 cpedialog (596 revisions last Dec 10, 2010) Too simple. Has blog engine. 
 GaeDjangocms (1.1) Too simple. 
 App Engine Site Creator (1.1.1) Simple, but professional. Lacks blog engine. 
 Nuages photoblog (revision 18) Too simple. Barely usable. 
 Niubi (revision 71) Promising, but couldn't make it work since it requires app engine helper for django 
 rocket - seat needs mako, I couldn't make it work 
 stoutsd not as customizable as I need. 
 

 Java 

 
 vosaocms (0.2) Sounds promising, but I couldn't run it as I am not familiarized with Java App Engine.

 #1 theres also gutecms

 edit: after trying out several options i chose http://www.vosao.org/ 
 #2 I currently use Vosao and while it's a bit rough around the edges, it works very well and is under active development. My site runs on Vosao and I recently wrote up a post on upgrading from version 0.0.4 to 0.1 if your interested in how to get it running. 
 #3 I am not a django developer, but, during the research for a very similar question I came across django-cms , which looks very promising. 

 It seems, as if there is a high interest in having a CMS running on google-app-engine. It is possible that with the Django 1.0 support in GAE ( release notes version 1.2.3 ), there will soon be a working version. Recent questions related to supporting django-cms on GAE on either of the two communities' discussion lists have not resulted in a definite answer yet. Here the references:

 #4 http://code.google.com/p/gae-django-cms/ 
 #5 Google returned the following options: 

 App Engine Site Creator 

 Magazine Life (e-magazine CMS) 

 Those seems to be new (testing versions). I would feel more confortable with more famous CMS. 
 #6 There is web2py framework and KPAX CMS based on it. 
 #7 http://helloweb-cms.appspot.com/ A very simple site management system for AppEngine. 
 #8 there's also Gapp CMS, rather basic but looks promising: http://gappcms.appspot.com/ 
 #9 This is a list of projects labelled by appengine python cms:

 #10 A cool CMS build upon Web2py and thus works on GAE out of the box is InstantPress , 
Watch this demo on how it work 
 #11 Another Python CMS for AppEngine: 

 https://github.com/tomvon/cygnuscms 
 #12 Check out this Django Nonrel site: "Allbuttonspressed" 

 This project is one of the Django Framework on App Engine. It has simplecms application installed by default, but for me its more then enough. Here is the short description 

 Source can be downloaded here: https://bitbucket.org/wkornewald/allbuttonspressed/src 

 This project support some other features, such as 

 
 blog 
 disqus (for blog comments), 
 simplesocial (to share to Google+, Facebook, or Twitter) 
 and many more, check out their source code 
 

 And of course the special things for me is that, this project using modified version of Django Framework so you can still take the advantage of django admin site , which is awesome. You can take advantage of the admin site to modify certain part of your website. For more information you can read up the Django-nonrel docs or djangoappengine Docs . The latter docs will highlight some of the limitation using django nonrel on appengine. 

 Good luck :) 

 FYI, I've just successfully deployed my appengine site using their simplecms application.
