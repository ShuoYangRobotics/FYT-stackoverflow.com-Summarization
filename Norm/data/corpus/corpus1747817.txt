Question (ID-1747817): Python: create a dictionary with list comprehension I like the python list comprehension operator (or idiom, or whatever it is). 

 Can it be used to create dictionaries too? For example, by iterating over pairs of keys and values: 

 dict = {(k,v) for (k,v) in blah blah blah} # doesn't work :(
 
 Answers (Total-3): #0 In Python 2.6 (or earlier), use the dict constructor: 

 d = dict((k,v) for (k,v) in blah blah blah)
 

 In Python 2.7+ or 3, you can just use the dict comprehension syntax directly: 

 d = {k : v for k in blah blah blah}
 
 #1 in py3k dict comprehensions work like this: 

 d = {k:v for k, v in iterable}
 

 in py2k you can use fortran's suggestion. 
 #2 Use python dict comprehensions: Here's the link to know more about it: Dict Comprehensions
