Question (ID-606516): Python Graph Library I'm writing a python application that will make heavy use of a graph data structure. Nothing horribly complex, but I'm thinking some sort of graph/graph-algorithms library would help me out. I've googled around, but I don't find anything that particularly leaps out at me. 

 Anyone have any good recommendations? 
 Answers (Total-8): #0 Seriously, there are two excellent choices: 

 NetworkX 

 and 

 igraph 

 I like NetworkX, but I read good things about igraph as well. I routinely use NetworkX with graphs with 1 million nodes with no problem (it's about double the overhead of a dict of size V + E) 

 If you want a feature comparison, see this from the Networkx-discuss list 

 Feature comparison thread 
 #1 Have you looked at python-graph ? I haven't used it myself, but the project page looks promising. 
 #2 Also, you might want to take a look at NetworkX 
 #3 Take a look at this page on implementing graphs in python . 

 You could also take a look at pygraphlib on sourceforge. 
 #4 I would like to plug my own graph python library: graph-tool . 

 It is very fast, since it is implemented in C++ with the Boost Graph Library, and it contains lots of algorithms and extensive documentation. 
 #5 Graphviz 
 #6 Use the Boost Graph Library - Python Bindings . 
 #7 also have a look here at bruno preiss's explanation of graphs and a sample implementation
