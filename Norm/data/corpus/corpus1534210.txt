Question (ID-1534210): Use different Python version with virtualenv I have a Debian system currently running with python 2.5.4. I got virtualenv properly installed, everything is working fine. Is there a possibility that I can use a virtualenv with a different version of Python? 

 I compiled Python 2.6.2 and would like to use it with some virtualenv. Is it enough to overwrite the binary file? Or do I have to change something in respect to the libraries? 
 Answers (Total-3): #0 Just use the -p flag when creating your virtualenv instance to specify the Python executable you want to use, eg: 

 virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.6
 
 #1 virtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python2.6 myvirtualenv 
 #2 Under Windows for me this works: 

 virtualenv --python=c:\Python25\python.exe envname
 

 without the python.exe I got WindowsError: [Error 5] Access is denied 
I have Python2.7.1 installed with virtualenv 1.6.1, and I wanted python 2.5.2.
