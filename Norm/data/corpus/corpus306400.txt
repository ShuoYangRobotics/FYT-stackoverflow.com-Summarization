Question (ID-306400): How do I randomly select an item from a list using Python? Let's say, as an example, I have the following list: 

 foo = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
 

 What is the best way to retrieve an item at random from this list? 
 Answers (Total-1): #0 foo = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
from random import choice
print choice(foo)
