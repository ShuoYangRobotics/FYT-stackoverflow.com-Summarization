Question (ID-582336): How can you profile a Python script? I've seen a quite a few questions on the Project Euler and other places asking how to time the execution of their solutions. Sometimes the given answers are somewhat kludgey - i.e., adding timing code to __main__ , so I thought I'd share my solution. 
 Answers (Total-4): #0 Python includes a profiler called cProfile. It not only gives the total running time, but also times each function separately, and tells you how many times each function was called, making it easy to determine where you should make optimizations. 

 You can call it from within your code, or from the interpreter, like this: 

 import cProfile
cProfile.run('foo()')
 

 Even more usefully, you can invoke the cProfile when running a script: 

 python -m cProfile myscript.py
 

 To make it even easier, I made a little batch file called 'profile.bat': 

 python -m cProfile %1
 

 So all I have to do is run: 

 profile euler048.py
 

 And I get this: 

 1007 function calls in 0.061 CPU seconds

Ordered by: standard name
ncalls tottime percall cumtime percall filename:lineno(function)
 1 0.000 0.000 0.061 0.061 &lt;string&gt;:1(&lt;module&gt;)

 1 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 {range}
 1 0.003 0.003 0.003 0.003 {sum}
 

 EDIT 
There is a great talk on profiling from PyCon here: http://blip.tv/file/1957086 
 #1 It's worth pointing out that using the profiler only works (by default) on the main thread, and you won't get any information from other threads if you use them. This can be a bit of a gotcha as it is completely unmentioned in the profiler documentation . 

 If you also want to profile threads, you'll want to look at the threading.setprofile() function in the docs. 

 You could also create your own threading.Thread subclass to do it: 

 class ProfiledThread(threading.Thread):
 # Overrides threading.Thread.run()
 def run(self):
  profiler = cProfile.Profile()
  try:
   return profiler.runcall(threading.Thread.run, self)
  finally:
   profiler.dump_stats('myprofile-%d.profile' % (self.ident,))
 

 and use that ProfiledThread class instead of the standard one. It might give you more flexibility, but I'm not sure it's worth it, especially if you are using third-party code which wouldn't use your class. 
 #2 In Virtaal's source there's a very useful class and decorator that can make it profiling (even for specific methods/functions) very easy. The output can then be viewed very comfortably in KCacheGrind. 
 #3 The python wiki is a great page for profiling resources:
 http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSpeed/PerformanceTips#Profiling_Code 

 as is the python docs:
 http://docs.python.org/library/profile.html 

 as shown by Chris Lawlor cPython is a great tool and can easily be used to print to the screen: 

 python -m cPython -s time mine.py &lt;args&gt;
 

 or to file: 

 python -m cPython -o output.file mine.py &lt;args&gt;
 

 PS> If you are using Ubuntu, make sure to install python-profile 

 sudo apt-get install python-profiler 
 

 If you output to file you can get nice visualizations using the following tools 

 PyCallGraph : a tool to create call graph images 
 install: 

 sudo easy_install pycallgraph
 

 run: 

 pycallgraph mine.py args
 

 view: 

 gimp pycallgraph.png
 

 You can use whatever you like to view the png file, I used gimp 
Unfortunately I often get 

 dot: graph is too large for cairo-renderer bitmaps. Scaling by 0.257079 to fit 

 which makes my images unusably small. So I generally create svg files: 

 pycallgraph -f svg -o pycallgraph.svg mine.py &lt;args&gt;
