Question (ID-115316): How can I consume a WSDL (SOAP) web service in Python? I want to use a WSDL SOAP based web service in Python. I have looked at the Dive Into Python code but the SOAPpy module does not work under Python 2.5. 

 I have tried using suds which works partly, but breaks with certain types (suds.TypeNotFound: Type not found: 'item'). 

 I have also looked at Client but this does not appear to support WSDL. 

 And I have looked at ZSI but it looks very complex. Does anyone have any sample code for it? 

 The WSDL is https://ws.pingdom.com/soap/PingdomAPI.wsdl and works fine with the PHP 5 SOAP client. 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 Right now, all the SOAP libraries available for python suck. I recommend avoiding SOAP if possible. The last time we where forced to use a SOAP web service from python, we wrote a wrapper in C# that handled the SOAP on one side and spoke COM out the other. 
 #1 I would recommend that you have a look at SUDS 

 "Suds is a lightweight SOAP python client for consuming Web Services." 
 #2 I always write my own at the HTTP level. It's really not that hard. I wrote the example here which should be a good starting point for you. Let me know if you have questions. 
 #3 I know this is an old thread but it was showing up at the top of google results so I wanted to share a more current discussion on Python and SOAP. 

 See: http://www.diveintopython.org/soap%5Fweb%5Fservices/index.html 
 #4 If you're rolling your own I'd highly recommend looking at http://effbot.org/zone/element-soap.htm . 
 #5 It's not true SOAPpy does not work with Python 2.5 - it works, although it's very simple and really, really basic. If you want to talk to any more complicated webservice, ZSI is your only friend. 

 The really useful demo I found is at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/webservices/tutorials/python - this really helped me to understand how ZSI works. 
 #6 SOAPpy is now obsolete, AFAIK, replaces by ZSL. It's a moot point, because I can't get either one to work, much less compile, on either Python 2.5 or Python 2.6
