Question (ID-6167238): What does [:] in Python mean I'm analyzing some Python code and I don't know what 

 pop = population[:]
 

 means. Is it something like array lists in Java or like a bi-dimensional array?
Could appreciate some help, thanks. 
 Answers (Total-4): #0 It's a slicing, and what it does depends on the type of population . If population is a list, this line will create a copy of the list. For an object of type tuple or a str , it will do nothing (the line will do the same without [:] ), and for a (say) NumPy array, it will create a new view to the same data. 
 #1 It might also help to know that a list slice in general makes a copy of part of the list. E.g. population[2:4] will return a list containing population[2] and population[3] (slicing is right-exclusive). Leaving away the left and right index, as in population[:] they default to 0 and length(population) respectively, thereby selecting the entire list. Hence this is a common idiom to make a copy of a list. 
 #2 It is a slice from the beginning of the sequence to the end, usually producing a shallow copy. 

 (Well, it's more than that , but you don't need to care yet.) 
 #3 It creates a copy of the list, versus just assigning a new name for the already existing list.
