Question (ID-466345): Converting string into datetime Short and simple. I've got a huge list of date-times like this as strings: 

 Jun 1 2005 1:33PM
Aug 28 1999 12:00AM
 

 I'm going to be shoving these back into proper datetime fields in a database so I need to magic them into real datetime objects. 

 Any help (even if it's just a kick in the right direction) would be appreciated. 

 Edit: This is going through Django's ORM so I can't use SQL to do the conversion on insert. 
 Answers (Total-4): #0 from datetime import datetime

date_object = datetime.strptime('Jun 1 2005 1:33PM', '%b %d %Y %I:%M%p')
 

 Link to the Python documentation for strptime 

 and a link for the strftime format mask 
 #1 Use the third party dateutil library: 

 from dateutil import parser
dt = parser.parse("Aug 28 1999 12:00AM")
 

 It can handle most date formats, including the one you need to parse. It's more convenient than strptime as it can guess the correct format most of the time. 
 #2 Check out strptime in the time module. It is the inverse of strftime . 
 #3 run this in query analyser/SSMS 

 select convert(datetime,'Aug 28 1999 12:00AM')
select convert(datetime,'Jun 1 2005 1:33PM')
