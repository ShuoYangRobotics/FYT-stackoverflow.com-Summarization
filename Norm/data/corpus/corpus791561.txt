Question (ID-791561): Python 2.5: JSON module I would like to use Python's JSON module. It was only introduced in Python 2.6 and I'm stuck with 2.5 for now. Is the particular JSON module provided with Python 2.6 available as a separate module that can be used with 2.5?

 #1 To Wells and others: 

 
 Way late here, but how can you write a script to import either json or simplejson depending on the installed python version? 
 

 Here's how:
 
try:
 import json
except ImportError:
 import simplejson as json 
 
 #2 I prefer cjson since it's much faster: http://www.vazor.com/cjson.html 
 #3 I wrote the cjson 1.0.6 patch and my advice is don't use cjson -- there are other problems with cjson in how it handles unicode etc. I don't think the speed of cjson is worth dealing with the bugs -- encoding/decoding json is usually a very small bit of the time needed to process a typical web request... 

 json in python 2.6+ is basically simplejson brought into the standard library I believe...
