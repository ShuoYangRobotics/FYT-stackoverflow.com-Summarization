Question (ID-448271): What is __init__.py for? What is __init__.py for in a python source directory? 
 Answers (Total-4): #0 Its part of a package. Here's the documentation. 

 
 The __init__.py files are required to make Python treat the directories as containing packages; this is done to prevent directories with a common name, such as string, from unintentionally hiding valid modules that occur later on the module search path. In the simplest case, __init__.py can just be an empty file, but it can also execute initialization code for the package or set the __all__ variable, described later. 
 
 #1 The __init__.py file makes Python treat directories containing it as modules. 

 Furthermore, this is the first file to be loaded in a module, so you can use it to execute code that you want to run each time a module is loaded, or specify the submodules to be exported. 
 #2 Files name __init__.py are used to mark directories on disk as Python package directories.
If you have the files 

 mydir/spam/__init__.py
midir/spam/module.py
 

 and mydir is on your path, you can import the code in module.py as 

 import spam.module
 

 or 

 from spam import module
 

 If you remove the __init__.py file, Python will no longer look for submodules inside that directory, so attempts to import the module will fail. 

 The __init__.py file is usually empty, but can be used to export selected portions of the package under more convenient name, hold convenience functions, etc.
Given the example above, the contents of the init module can be accessed as 

 import spam
 

 based on http://effbot.org/pyfaq/what-is-init-py-used-for.htm 
 #3 It facilitates importing other python files. When you placed this file in a directory (say stuff)containing other py files, then you can do something like import stuff.other. 

 root\
 stuff\
   other.py

 morestuff\
   another.py
 

 Without this init.py inside the directory stuff, you couldn't import other.py, because Python doesn't know where the source code for stuff is and unable to recognize it as a package.
