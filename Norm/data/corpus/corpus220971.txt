 Only free (for 10 MB) one listed there: http://www.alwaysdata.com 
 #1 new kid on the block!
 HelioHost 

 I have already registered - time will tell what comes out of this.
Looks too good, gotta say! 
 #2 If you didn't mean to exclude virtualized hosts, you can use the free VMWare Player and something like Ubuntu JeOS (70m lightweight os), also no charge. The player defaults to bridged networking so you can test your Django installation locally or remotely provided you forward ports properly. The package names for Django dependencies on JeOS would be python-psycopg2 (for postgres) or python-mysqldb , and python-support . 
 #3 See http://djangofriendly.com/hosts/ - the only free is already mentioned here AlwaysData, but you can find a plenty of cheap options. WebFaction and djangohosting.ch seems to be good (and cheap) choices for a start. 
 #4 These guys offer free Django hosting:

 Haven't tried them, but it's worth a shot!? 
 #5 free Python hosting at keeflex.com 
 #6 Unfortunately, I think there is no free django hostings, at least with public status. 

 You can try to find something not expensive here or here . 

 Not an AD, only personal experience:
Among others, I like Ukrainian hoster TopHost (TopHost.com.ua), they have no english page, so write directly sales@tophost.com.ua, their Django tariff 11$/month, and they give 2 free month for year, if you're hosting python project. 
 #7 You should take a look at shellmix.com which provide free shell accounts on their machines. 

 Along with the free account, you have access to python and django, free of charge . 

 With Shellmix.com : 

 
 You can run what you want (according with the general rules of use of the service) 
 You can run 20 background process 
 You have access to programming environment:
c, c++, tcl, python, perl, java, php, ruby, rubygems, ruby on rails, 
 Your home directory is protected from other users 
 You can provide own website 
 You can park own domain free 
 You have your own virtual host domain 
 

 Here is the full list of software already installed . 

 Along with the free account, you have 200 MB Hard Drive space, and 10MB MySQL database. 
 #8 try http://ep.io . They provide good django hosting and the provide some free limits which would surface for test purposes. They also include means to install third party packages like south. Unlike Google App Engine Data store, they have postgresql and mysql. But the plans could also be upgraded (must pay for this).
