<h3>Question ( ID-3986353 ) : </h3><h2>How two merge several .csv files horizontally with python ? </h2><p>I 've several .csv files ( ~ 10 ) and need to merge them together into a single file horizontally. Each file has the same number of rows ( ~ 300 ) and 4 header lines which are not necessarily identical , but should not be merged ( only take the header lines from the first .csv file ) . The tokens in the lines are comma separated with no spaces in between . </p>
<p>As a python noob I 've not come up with a solution , though I 'm sure there 's a simple solution to this problem. Any help is welcome . </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-6 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>You can load the CSV files using the <span style="background-color:yellow;">csv</span> module in Python. Please refer to the documentation of this module for the loading code , I can not remember it but it is really easy. Something like : </p>
<pre><code>import csv
reader = csv.reader(open("some.csv", "rb"))
csvContent = list(reader)
</code></pre>
<p>After that , when you have the CSV files loaded in such form ( a list of tuples ) : </p>
<pre><code>[ ("header1", "header2", "header3", "header4"),
  ("value01", "value12", "value13", "value14"),
  ("value11", "value12", "value13", "value14"),
  ... 
]
</code></pre>
<p>You can merge two such lists line-by-line : </p>
<pre><code>result = [a+b for (a,b) in zip(csvList1, csvList2)]
</code></pre>
<p>To save such a <span style="background-color:yellow;">result</span> , you can use : </p>
<pre><code>writer = csv.writer(open("some.csv", "wb"))
writer.writerows(result)
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>The <span style="background-color:yellow;">csv</span> module is you friend . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>You dont need to use <span style="background-color:yellow;">csv</span> module for this. You can just use </p>
<pre><code>file1 = open(file1)
</code></pre>
<p>After opening all your files you can do this </p>
<pre><code>from itertools import izip_longest

foo=[]
for new_line in izip_longest(file1,fil2,file3....,fillvalue=''):
    foo.append(new_line)
</code></pre>
<p>This will give you this structure ( which kon has already told you ) ..It will also work if you have different number of lines in each file </p>
<pre><code>[ ("line10", "line20", "line30", "line40"),
  ("line11", "line21", "line31", "line41"),
  ... 
]
</code></pre>
<p>After this you can just write it to a new file taking 1 list at a time </p>
<pre><code>for listx in foo:
    new_file.write(','.join(j for j in listx))
</code></pre>

<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>You learn by doing ( and trying , even ) . So , I 'll just give you a few hints. Use the following functions : </p>
<ul>To open a file : open ( ) To read all the lines in a file : IOBase.readlines ( ) To split a string according to a series of splitting tokents : str.split ( ) </ul>
<p>If you really do n't know what to do , I recommend you read the tutorial and Dive Into Python 3 . ( Depending on how much Python you know , you 'll either have to read through the first few chapters or cut straight to the file IO chapters. ) </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>If you do n't necessarily have to use Python , you can use shell tools like paste/gawk etc </p>
<pre><code>$ paste file1 file2 file3 file4 .. | awk 'NR>4'
</code></pre>
<p>The above will put them horizontally without the headers. If you want the headers , just get them from <span style="background-color:yellow;">file1</span> </p>
<pre><code>$  ( head -4 file ; paste file[1-4] | awk 'NR>4' ) > output
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>Purely for learning purposes </p>
<p>A simple approach that does not take advantage of <span style="background-color:yellow;">csv</span> module : </p>
<pre><code># open file to write
file_to_write = open(filename, 'w')
# your list of csv files
csv_files = [file1, file2, ...] 

headers = True
# iterate through your list
for filex in csv_files:
    # mark the lines that are header lines
    header_count = 0
    # open the csv file and read line by line
    filex_f = open(filex, 'r')
    for line in filex_f:
        # write header only once
        if headers:
            file_to_write.write(line+"\n")
            if header_count > 3: headers = False
        # Write all other lines to the file
        if header_count > 3:
            file_to_write.write(line+"\n")
        # count lines
        header_count = header_count + 1
    # close file
    filex_f.close()
file_to_write.close()
</code></pre>
