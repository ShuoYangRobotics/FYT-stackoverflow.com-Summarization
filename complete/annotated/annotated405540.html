<h3>Question ( ID-405540 ) : </h3><h2>What is a cyclic data structure good for ? </h2><p>I was just reading through " <span style="background-color:yellow;">Learning</span> Python " by Mark <span style="background-color:yellow;">Lutz</span> and came across this code sample : </p>
<pre><code>
>>> L = ['grail']
>>> L.append(L)
>>> L
['grail', [...]]

</code></pre>
<p>It was identified as a cyclic data structure . </p>
<p>So I was wondering , and here is my question : </p>
<h2>What is a 'cyclic data structure ' used for in real life programming ? </h2>
<p>There seems to be a little confusion , which i think stems from the very brief code sample... here 's a few more lines using the same <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">L</span> </p>
<pre><code>
>>> L[0]
'grail'
>>> L[1][0]
'grail'
>>> L[1][1][0]
'grail'

</code></pre>
<h2>edit : I 'll be honest , I still do n't really get it. can anyone give some code samples ? </h2>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-13 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p><span style="background-color:yellow;">Lots</span> of things. Circular buffer , for example : you have some collection of data with a front and a back , but an arbitrary number of nodes , and the " next " <span style="background-color:yellow;">item</span> from the last should take you back to the first . </p>
<p>Graph structures are often cyclic ; acyclicity is a special case. Consider , for example , a graph containing all the cities and roads in a traveling salesman problem . </p>
<p></p>
<p>Okay , here 's a particular example for you. I set up a collection of towns here in Colorado : </p>
<pre><code>V=["Boulder", "Denver", "Colorado Springs", "Pueblo", "Limon"]
</code></pre>
<p>I then set up pairs of cities where there is a road connecting them . </p>
<pre><code>E=[["Boulder", "Denver"],
   ["Denver", "Colorado Springs"],
   ["Colorado Springs", "Pueblo"],
   ["Denver", "Limon"],
   ["Colorado Springs", "Limon"]]
</code></pre>
<p>This has a bunch of cycles. For example , you can drive from Colorado Springs , to <span style="background-color:yellow;">Limon</span> , to Denver , and back to Colorado Springs . </p>
<p>If you create a data structure that contains all the cities in <span style="background-color:yellow;">V</span> and all the roads in <span style="background-color:yellow;">E</span> , that 's a graph data structure. This graph would have cycles . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>I recently created a cyclic data structure to represent the eight cardinal and ordinal <span style="background-color:yellow;">directions.</span> Its useful for each <span style="background-color:yellow;">direction</span> to know its neighbors. For instance , Direction.North knows that Direction.NorthEast and Direction.NorthWest are its neighbors . </p>
<p>This is cyclic because each neighor knows its neighbors until it goes full swing around ( the " -&gt ; " represents clockwise ) : </p>
<p>North -&gt ; NorthEast -&gt ; <span style="background-color:yellow;">East</span> -&gt ; SouthEast -&gt ; South -&gt ; SouthWest -&gt ; West -&gt ; NorthWest -&gt ; North -&gt ; .. . </p>
<p>Notice we came back to North . </p>
<p>That allows me to do stuff like this ( in C # ) : </p>
<pre><code>public class Direction
{
    ...
    public IEnumerable<Direction> WithTwoNeighbors
    {
        get {
           yield return this;
           yield return this.CounterClockwise;
           yield return this.Clockwise;
        }
    }
}
...
public void TryToMove (Direction dir)
{
    dir = dir.WithTwoNeighbors.Where (d => CanMove (d)).First ()
    Move (dir);
}
</code></pre>
<p>This turned out to be quite handy and made a lot of things much less complicated. Here 's the full class . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p><span style="background-color:yellow;">Erm</span> , I am not sure as I a have n't used them at all in real life , but it could be used to simulate a nested data structure ? See this link </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>One example would be a linked list where the last <span style="background-color:yellow;">item</span> points the first. This would allow you to create a fixed number of <span style="background-color:yellow;">items</span> but always be able to get a next <span style="background-color:yellow;">item</span> . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>when doing lattice simulations cyclic/toroidal boundary conditions are often used. usually a simple lattice [ i % <span style="background-color:yellow;">L</span> ] would suffice , but i suppose one could create the lattice to be cyclic . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>A nested structure could be used in a test case for a garbage collector . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>The data structures iterated by deterministic finite automata are often cyclical . </p>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>Suppose you have limited storage , and data constantly accumulates. In many real life cases , you do n't mind getting rid of old data , but you do n't want to move data. You can use a cyclic vector ; implemented using a vector v of size N with two special indices : begin and end , which initiate on 0 . </p>
<p>Insertion of " new " data now goes like this : </p>
<pre><code>v[end] = a;
end = (end+1) % N;
if (begin == end)
  begin = (begin+1) % N;
</code></pre>
<p>You can insert " old " data and erase " old " or " new " data in a similar way . Scanning the vector goes like this </p>
<pre><code>for (i=begin; i != end; i = (i+1) % N) {
 // do stuff
}
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 8 </b><br /><p>Cyclic data structures are usually used to represent circular relationships. That sounds obvious , but it happens more than you think. I ca n't think of any times I 've used terribly complicated cyclical data structures , but bidirectional relationships are fairly common. For example , suppose I wanted to make an IM client. I could do something like this : </p>
<pre><code>class Client(object):
    def set_remote(self, remote_client):
        self.remote_client = remote_client

    def send(self, msg):
        self.remote_client.receive(msg)

    def receive(self, msg):
        print msg

Jill = Client()
Bob = Client()
Bob.set_remote(Jill)    
Jill.set_remote(Bob)
</code></pre>
<p>Then if <span style="background-color:yellow;">Bob</span> wanted to <span style="background-color:yellow;">send</span> a message to <span style="background-color:yellow;">Jill</span> , you could just do this : </p>
<pre><code>Bob.send("Hi, Jill!")
</code></pre>
<p>Of course , <span style="background-color:yellow;">Jill</span> may want to <span style="background-color:yellow;">send</span> a message back , so she could do this : </p>
<pre><code>Jill.send("Hi, Bob!")
</code></pre>
<p>Admittedly , this is a bit of a contrived example , but it should give you an example of when you may want to use a cyclical data structure . </p>
<br /><b># 9 </b><br /><p>Any kind of <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> hierarchy where parents know <span style="background-color:yellow;">about</span> their children and children know <span style="background-color:yellow;">about</span> their parents. I 'm always having to deal with this in ORMs because I want databases to know their tables and tables to know what database they 're a part of , and so on . </p>
<br /><b># 10 </b><br /><p>It is a bit confusing since it is a list that contains itself , but the way I made sense of it is to not think of <span style="background-color:yellow;">L</span> as a list , but a node , and instead of things in a list , you think of it as other nodes reachable by this node . </p>
<p>To put a more real world example , think of them as flight paths from a city . </p>
<p>So chicago = [ denver , los angeles , new york city , chicago ] ( realistically you would n't list chicago in itself , but for the sake of example you can reach chicago from chicago ) </p>
<p>Then you have denver = [ phoenix , philedelphia ] and so on . </p>
<p>phoenix = [ chicago , new york city ] </p>
<p>Now you have cyclic data both from </p>
<blockquote>chicago -&gt ; chicago </blockquote>
<p>but also </p>
<blockquote>chicago -&gt ; denver -&gt ; phoenix -&gt ; chicago </blockquote>
<p>Now you have : </p>
<pre><code>chicago[0] == denver
chicago[0][0] == phoenix
chicago[0][0][0] == chicago
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 11 </b><br /><p><span style="background-color:yellow;">L</span> just contains a reference to itself as one of it 's elements. Nothing really special <span style="background-color:yellow;">about</span> this. There are some obvious uses of cyclical structures where the last element knows <span style="background-color:yellow;">about</span> the first element. But this functionality is already covered by regular python lists . </p>
<p>You can get the first element by using [ -1 ] . You can use python lists as queues with <span style="background-color:yellow;">append</span> ( ) and pop ( ) . You can split python lists. Which are the regular uses of a cyclical data structure . </p>
<pre><code>>>> L = ['foo', 'bar']
>>> L.append(L)
>>> L
['foo', 'bar', [...]]
>>> L[0]
'foo'
>>> L[1]
'bar'
>>> L[2]
['foo', 'bar', [...]]
>>> L[2].append('baz')
>>> L
['foo', 'bar', [...], 'baz']
>>> L[2]
['foo', 'bar', [...], 'baz']
>>> L[2].pop()
'baz'
>>> L
['foo', 'bar', [...]]
>>> L[2]
['foo', 'bar', [...]]
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 12 </b><br /><p><span style="background-color:yellow;">Let</span> 's look at a single practical example . </p>
<p><span style="background-color:yellow;">Let</span> us say we 're programming a menu navigation for a game. We want to store for each menu-item </p>
<ol>The entry 's name The other menu we 'll reach after pressing it . The action that would be performed when pressing the menu . </ol>
<p>When a menu-item is pressed , we 'll activate the menu-item action and then move to the next menu. So our menu would be a simple list of dictionaries , like so : </p>
<pre><code>options,start_menu,about = [],[],[]

def do_nothing(): pass

about += [
    {'name':"copyright by...",'action':None,'menu':about},
    {'name':"back",'action':do_nothing,'menu':start_menu}
    ]
options += [
    {'name':"volume up",'action':volumeUp,'menu':options},
    {'name':"save",'action':save,'menu':start_menu},
    {'name':"back without save",'action':do_nothing,'menu':start_menu}
    ]
start_menu += [
    {'name':"Exit",'action':f,'menu':None}, # no next menu since we quite
    {'name':"Options",'action':do_nothing,'menu':options},
    {'name':"About",'action':do_nothing,'menu':about}
    ]
</code></pre>
<p>See how <span style="background-color:yellow;">about</span> is cyclic : </p>
<pre><code>>>> print about
[{'action': None, 'menu': [...], 'name': 'copyright by...'},#etc.
# see the ellipsis (...)
</code></pre>
<p>When a menu <span style="background-color:yellow;">item</span> is pressed we 'll issue the following on-click function : </p>
<pre><code>def menu_item_pressed(item):
    log("menu item '%s' pressed" % item['name'])
    item['action']()
    set_next_menu(item['menu'])
</code></pre>
<p>Now , if we would n't have cyclic data structures , we would n't be able to have a menu <span style="background-color:yellow;">item</span> that points to itself , and , for instance , after pressing the volume-up function we would have to leave the <span style="background-color:yellow;">options</span> menu . </p>
<p>If cyclic data structures would n't be possible , we 'll have to implement it ourselves , for example the menu <span style="background-color:yellow;">item</span> would be : </p>
<pre><code>class SelfReferenceMarkerClass: pass
#singleton global marker for self reference
SelfReferenceMarker = SelfReferenceMarkerClass()
about += [
    {'name':"copyright by...",'action':None,'menu':srm},
    {'name':"back",'action':do_nothing,'menu':start_menu}
    ]
</code></pre>
<p>the <span style="background-color:yellow;">menu_item_pressed</span> function would be : </p>
<pre><code>def menu_item_pressed(item):
    item['action']()
    if (item['menu'] == SelfReferenceMarker):
        set_next_menu(get_previous_menu())
    else:
        set_next_menu(item['menu'])
</code></pre>
<p>The first example is a little bit nicer , but yes , not supporting self references is not such a big deal IMHO , as it 's easy to overcome this limitation . </p>
<p>The menus example is like a graph with self references , where we store the graph by lists of vertex pointers ( every vertex is a list of pointers to other vertices ) . In this example we needed self edges ( a vertex that points to itself ) , thus python 's support for cyclic data structures is useful . </p>
