<h3>Question ( ID-320232 ) : </h3><h2>Ensuring subprocesses are dead on exiting Python program </h2><p>Is there a way to ensure all created subprocess are dead at exit time of a Python program ? By subprocess I mean those created with subprocess.Popen ( ) . </p>
<p>If not , should I iterate over all of the issuing kills and then kills -9 ? anything cleaner ? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-6 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>The subprocess.Popen.wait ( ) is the only way to assure that they 're dead. Indeed , POSIX OS 's require that you wait on your children. Many * nix 's will create a " zombie " process : a dead child for which the parent did n't wait . </p>
<p>If the child is reasonably well-written , it terminates. Often , children read from PIPE 's. Closing the input is a big hint to the child that it should close up shop and exit . </p>
<p>If the child has bugs and does n't terminate , you may have to kill it. You should fix this bug . </p>
<p>If the child is a " serve-forever " loop , and is not designed to terminate , you should either kill it or provide some input or message which will force it to terminate . </p>
<p></p>
<p>Edit . </p>
<p>In standard OS 's , you have os.kill ( PID , 9 ) . Kill -9 is harsh , BTW. If you can kill them with SIGABRT ( 6 ? ) or SIGTERM ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">15</span> ) that 's more polite . </p>
<p>In Windows OS , you do n't have an os.kill that works. Look at this ActiveState Recipe for terminating a process in Windows . </p>
<p>We have child processes that are WSGI servers. To terminate them we do a GET on a special URL ; this causes the child to clean up and exit . </p>
<br /><b># <span style="background-color:yellow;">1</span> </b><br /><p>You can use <span style="background-color:yellow;">atexit</span> for this , and <span style="background-color:yellow;">register</span> any clean up tasks to be run when your program exits . </p>
<p><span style="background-color:yellow;">atexit.register</span> ( func [ , * args [ , * * kargs ] ] ) </p>
<p>In your <span style="background-color:yellow;">cleanup</span> process , you can also implement your own wait , and kill it when a your desired timeout occurs . </p>
<pre><code>>>> import atexit
>>> import sys
>>> import time
>>> 
>>> 
>>>
>>> def cleanup():
...     timeout_sec = 5
...     for p in all_processes: # list of your processes
...         p_sec = 0
...         for second in range(timeout_sec):
...             if p.poll() == None:
...                 time.sleep(1)
...                 p_sec += 1
...         if p_sec >= timeout_sec:
...             p.kill() # supported from python 2.6
...     print 'cleaned up!'
...
>>>
>>> atexit.register(cleanup)
>>>
>>> sys.exit()
cleaned up!

<p>Note -- Registered functions wo n't be run if this process ( parent process ) is killed . </p>
<p>Here 's a way to kill a process in windows. Your Popen object has a <span style="background-color:yellow;">pid</span> attribute , so you can just call it by success = <span style="background-color:yellow;">win_kill</span> ( p.pid ) ( Needs pywin32 installed ) : </p>
<pre><code>    def win_kill(pid):
        '''kill a process by specified PID in windows'''
        import win32api
        import win32con

        hProc = None
        try:
            hProc = win32api.OpenProcess(win32con.PROCESS_TERMINATE, 0, pid)
            win32api.TerminateProcess(hProc, 0)
        except Exception:
            return False
        finally:
            if hProc != None:
                hProc.Close()

        return True
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>On * nix 's , maybe using process groups can help you out - you can catch subprocesses spawned by your subprocesses as well . </p>
<pre><code>if __name__ == "__main__":
  os.setpgrp() # create new process group, become its leader
  try:
    # some code
  finally:
    os.killpg(0, signal.SIGKILL) # kill all processes in my group
</code></pre>
<p>Another consideration is to escalate the signals : from SIGTERM ( default signal for kill ) to SIGKILL ( a.k.a kill -9 ) . Wait a short while between the signals to give the process a chance to exit cleanly before you kill -9 it . </p>

<p>You could violate encapsulation and test that all Popen processes have terminated by doing </p>
<pre><code>subprocess._cleanup()
print subprocess._active == []
</code></pre>
<blockquote>If not , should I iterate over all of the issuing kills and then kills -9 ? anything cleaner ? </blockquote>
<p>You can not ensure that all subprocesses are dead without going out and killing every survivor. But if you have this problem , it is probably because you have a deeper design problem . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>This is what I did for my posix app : </p>
<p>When your app exists call the kill ( ) method of this class : http : //www.pixelbeat.org/libs/subProcess.py </p>
<p>Example use here : http : //code.google.com/p/fslint/source/browse/trunk/fslint-gui # 608 </p>
