<h3>Question ( ID-5436983 ) : </h3><h2>Can the switch statement have more than one variable ? </h2><p>The question is based in all the languages that use the switch block ( C + + , C # PHP , Java , Python and so on ) . So is it possible to have something like this ? </p>
<pre><code>switch (var1, var2)
case  var1 = a:
    something
    break;
case var2 = b:
    something
    break;
case var1 = 0 ,var2 = 1
     etc...

<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-11 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>Python does not have a switch statement. The recommended alternative is using a chained if/else chain - which is what you ought to be using in your case anyway . </p>
<p>Another common idiom is using a map. And in your case you could use a tuple of ( var1,var2 ) to match against results . </p>
<pre><code>switch = {
   (1,2): lambda: ..,
   (3,4): lambda: ...,
}
switch[(var1,var2)]
</code></pre>
<p>I 'm not sure this is commonly used , but at least it 's possible . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>Yes/No . </p>
<p>No traditional language with a " switch " statement has this. It does exist in something called " pattern matching " . </p>
<p>C # , Java , PHP , and Python do not support pattern matching ( not completely sure about PHP , but I do n't believe it does. Correct me if I 'm wrong ) . </p>
<p>Here 's an example in Haskell where pattern matching does exist. Pattern matching is in a lot of functional style languages . </p>
<pre><code>function 1 _ = "first parameter has a one"
function _ 1 = "second parameter is a one"
function _ _ = "I don't know what crazy number you passed in"
</code></pre>
<p>When that function is called , the runtime/compiler/whoever checks it will see if the first function can be called. If it can , it returns that value. It then keeps going until it can find some match that works for the given parameters. The " _ " is just a way of saying , " anything can be here , and I really do n't care what it is so do n't bind the value to a name " . If I cared about the value , I could do : </p>
<pre><code>function 1 a = "second parameter is " ++ (show a)
</code></pre>
<p>Now since it usually goes top-down ( unlike the switch statement ) , this is more akin to an if/else than a switch statement which just jumps to the correct spot. It 's just a very nice looking if/else. Also , if I reordered it so the most general case was at the top of the file , the other cases would be ignored . </p>
<p>You can also do something similar with templates , but that will only work at compile time . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>You could do something similar to what you want in Scala ( and any other functional language , with a pattern-matching mechanism ) : </p>
<pre><code>def matchTest(var1: Any, var2: Any): Any = (var1, var2) match {
  case (a, _) => "var1 == a"
  case (_, b) => "var2 == b"
  case (0, 1) => "var1 == 0, var2 == 1"
}
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>I think you can do arbitrary case matching in some languages like Haskell and ML. See Haskell Pattern Matching . The object in question is still a single object , but that object can be a tuple which contains an arbitrary number of objects . </p>
<p>An example given in the link is : </p>
<pre><code>describeList :: [a] -> String
describeList list = 
  case list of
   []     -> "The list was empty"
   (x:xs) -> "The list wasn't empty: the first element was " ++ show x ++
             ", and there were " ++ show (length xs) ++
             " more elements in the list."

<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>CHILL allows it : </p>

<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>As said , this pattern matching is typical of functional languages. But you can find some at least " hybrid " functional/OOP ones that support it . </p>
<p>Here 's an example in F # </p>
<pre><code>let fnc (var1, var2) =
    match (var1, var2) with
        | 2 , _ -> "something"
        | _ , 3 -> "something else"
        | 0, 1  -> "etc ... "
        | a, b -> "I got " + a.ToString() + " and " + b.ToString()

fnc(0, 1) |> printfn "%s" // prints "etc.."
</code></pre>
<p>and the same in scala </p>
<pre><code>def fnc(var1: Int, var2: Int) : String = 
  (var1, var2) match { 
    case (2, _) => "something" 
    case ( _,3) => "something else"
    case (0, 1) => "etc..."
    case (a, b) => "I got " + a + " and " + b
  } 

println(fnc(0,1))

<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>I 've never seen a language that allows that , no . </p>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>Certainly not in C # . You 'd use an if/else if pattern to fall through conditions like these. I ca n't speak for any other language with authority but I 'm 99 % sure Java does n't allow it either. Who knows what those crazy PHP and Python guys allow , though.. . </p>
<br /><b># 8 </b><br /><p>No. You will have to nest the switch case for one variable inside each case of the other . </p>
<br /><b># 9 </b><br /><p>If you think about it , the languages ca n't allow that because you could end up with more than one case that would be true . </p>
<br /><b># 10 </b><br /><p>AFAIK , python does not have switch-case . </p>
