<h3>Question ( ID-1272309 ) : </h3><h2>Batch output redirection when using start command for GUI app </h2><p>This is the scenario : </p>
<p>We have a Python script that starts a Windows batch file and redirects its output to a file. Afterwards it reads the file and then tries to delete it : </p>
<pre><code>os.system(C:\batch.bat >C:\temp.txt 2>&1)
os.remove(C:\temp.txt)
</code></pre>
<p>In the batch.bat we start a Windows GUI programm like this : </p>
<pre><code>start c:\the_programm.exe
</code></pre>
<p></p>
<p>Now the <span style="background-color:yellow;">os.remove</span> ( ) fails with " Permission denied " because the temp.txt is still locked by the <span style="background-color:yellow;">system.</span> It seems this is caused by the still runing the_programm.exe ( whos output also seems to be redirected to the temp.txt ) . </p>
<p>Any idea how to start the_programm.exe without having the temp.txt locked while it is still running ? The Python part is hardly changeable as this is a tool ( BusyB ) . </p>
<p>In fact I do not need the output of the_programm.exe , so the essence of the question is : How do I decouple the_programm.exe from locking temp.txt for its output ? Or : How do I use START or another Windows command to start a program without inheriting the batch output redirection ? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-6 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>This is a bit hacky , but you could try it. It uses the AT command to run the_programm.exe up to a minute in the future ( which it computes using the % TIME % environment variable and SET arithmetic ) . </p>
<p>batch.bat : </p>
<pre><code>@echo off
setlocal
:: store the current time so it does not change while parsing
set t=%time%
:: parse hour, minute, second
set h=%t:~0,2%
set m=%t:~3,2%
set s=%t:~6,2%
:: reduce strings to simple integers
if "%h:~0,1%"==" " set h=%h:~1%
if "%m:~0,1%"=="0" set m=%m:~1%
if "%s:~0,1%"=="0" set s=%s:~1%
:: choose number of seconds in the future; granularity for AT is one
:: minute, plus we need a few extra seconds for this script to run
set x=70
:: calculate hour and minute to run the program
set /a x=s + x
set /a s="x %% 60"
set /a x=m + x / 60
set /a m="x %% 60"
set /a h=h + x / 60
set /a h="h %% 24"
:: schedule the program to run
at %h%:%m% c:\the_programm.exe
</code></pre>
<p>You can look at the AT / ? and SET / ? to see what each of these is doing. I left off the /interactive parameter of AT since you commented that " no user interaction is allowed " . </p>
<p>Caveats : </p>
<ul>It appears that % TIME % is always 24-hour time , regardless of locale settings in the control panel , but I do n't have any proof of this . If your <span style="background-color:yellow;">system</span> is loaded down and batch.bat takes more than 10 seconds to run , the AT command will be scheduled to run 1 day later. You can recover this manually , using AT { job } /delete , and increase the x = 70 to something more acceptable . </ul>
<p>The START command , unfortunately , even when given /i to ignore the current environment , seems to pass along the open file descriptors of the parent cmd.exe process. These file descriptors appear to be handed off to <span style="background-color:yellow;">subprocesses</span> , even if the <span style="background-color:yellow;">subprocesses</span> are redirected to NUL , and are kept open even if intermediate shell processes terminate. You can see this in Process Explorer if you have a batch file which START s another batch file which START s another batch file ( etc. ) which START s a GUI Windows app. Once the intermediate batch files have terminated , the GUI app will own the file handles , even if it ( and the intermediate batch files ) were all redirected to NUL . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>I do n't think Windows will let you delete an open file. Sounds like you 're wanting to throw away the program 's output ; would redirecting to 'nul ' instead do what you need ? </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>As I understand it , this is the issue , and what he wants to do : </p>
<ol>Make no changes to the python code . The Python code is written assuming that " temp.txt " is no longer being used when this function returns : <span style="background-color:yellow;">os.system</span> ( C : \ batch.bat &gt ; C : \ temp.txt 2&gt ; &amp ; 1 ) This is in fact not the case because " batch.bat " spawns an interactive GUI program using the " start " command . </ol>
<p>How about changing your " batch.bat " file to contain : </p>
<pre><code>start c:\the_programm.exe
pause
</code></pre>
<p>This will keep the " batch.bat " file running until you hit a key on that window. Once you hit a key , the " <span style="background-color:yellow;">os.system</span> " python command will return , and then python will call " <span style="background-color:yellow;">os.remove</span> " . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>Are you closing the file after you 're done reading it ? The following works at my end : </p>
<pre><code>import os

os.system('runbat.bat > runbat.log 2>&1')
f = open('runbat.log')
print f.read()
f.close()
os.remove('runbat.log')
</code></pre>
<p>but fails if I <span style="background-color:yellow;">remove</span> the f.close ( ) line . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Why capture to a file if you 're just deleting it immediately ? </p>
<p>How about this : </p>
<pre><code>os.system(C:\batch.bat >nul 2>&1)
</code></pre>
<p>EDIT : Oops , I missed your comment about reading the file , I only noticed the code . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>Finally I could find a proper solution : </p>
<p>I am not using a batch file anymore for starting the_programm.exe , but a Python script : </p>
<pre><code>from subprocess import Popen

     if __name__ == '__main__':
          Popen('C:/the_programm.exe', close_fds=True)
</code></pre>
<p>The close_fds parameter decouples the file handles from the .exe process ! That 's it ! </p>
