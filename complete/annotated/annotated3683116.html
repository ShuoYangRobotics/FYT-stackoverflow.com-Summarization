<h3>Question ( ID-3683116 ) : </h3><h2>Parameter names in Python <span style="background-color:yellow;">functions</span> that take single object or <span style="background-color:yellow;">iterable</span> </h2><p>I have some <span style="background-color:yellow;">functions</span> in my code that accept either an object or an <span style="background-color:yellow;">iterable</span> of objects as input. I was taught to use meaningful names <span style="background-color:yellow;">for</span> everything , but I am not sure how to comply here. What should I call a parameter that can a sinlge object or an <span style="background-color:yellow;">iterable</span> of objects ? I have come up with two ideas , but I do n't like either of them : </p>
<ol>FooOrManyFoos - This expresses what goes on , but I could imagine that someone not used to it could have trouble understanding what it means right away param - Some generic name. This makes clear that it can be several things , but does explain nothing about what the parameter is used <span style="background-color:yellow;">for</span> . </ol>
<p>Normally I call <span style="background-color:yellow;">iterables</span> of objects just the plural of what I would call a single object. I know this might seem a little bit compulsive , but Python is supposed to be ( among others ) about readability . </p>

<p>This is a very exceptional and often very bad thing to do. It 's trivially avoidable . </p>
<p>i.e. , pass [ <span style="background-color:yellow;">foo</span> ] instead of <span style="background-color:yellow;">foo</span> when calling this <span style="background-color:yellow;">function</span> . </p>
<p>The only time you can justify doing this is when ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">1</span> ) you have an installed base of software that expects one <span style="background-color:yellow;">form</span> ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">iterable</span> or singleton ) and ( 2 ) you have to expand it to support the other use case. So. You only do this when expanding an existing <span style="background-color:yellow;">function</span> that has an existing code base . </p>
<p>If this is new development , Do Not Do This . </p>

<p>[ Only two ? ] </p>
<blockquote>FooOrManyFoos - This expresses what goes on , but I could imagine that someone not used to it could have trouble understanding what it means right away </blockquote>
<p>What ? Are you saying you provide NO other documentation , and no other training ? No support ? No advice ? Who is the " someone not used to it " ? Talk to them. Do n't assume or imagine things about them . </p>
<p>Also , do n't use Leading Upper Case Names . </p>
<blockquote>param - Some generic name. This makes clear that it can be several things , but does explain nothing about what the parameter is used <span style="background-color:yellow;">for</span> . </blockquote>
<p>Terrible. Never. Do. This . </p>
<p>I looked in the Python library <span style="background-color:yellow;">for</span> examples. Most of the <span style="background-color:yellow;">functions</span> that do this have simple descriptions . </p>
<p>http : //docs.python.org/library/functions.html # isinstance </p>
<p>isinstance ( object , classinfo ) </p>
<p>They call it " classinfo " and it can be a class or a tuple of classes . </p>
<p>You could do that , too . </p>
<p>You must consider the common use case and the exceptions. Follow the 80/20 rule . </p>
<ol>80 % of the time , you can replace this with an <span style="background-color:yellow;">iterable</span> and not have this problem . In the remaining 20 % of the cases , you have an installed base of software built around an assumption ( either <span style="background-color:yellow;">iterable</span> or single item ) and you need to add the other case. Do n't change the name , just change the documentation. If it used to say " <span style="background-color:yellow;">foo</span> " it still says " <span style="background-color:yellow;">foo</span> " but you make it accept an <span style="background-color:yellow;">iterable</span> of " <span style="background-color:yellow;">foo</span> 's " without making any change to the parameters. If it used to say " <span style="background-color:yellow;">foo_list</span> " or " <span style="background-color:yellow;">foo_iter</span> " , then it still says " <span style="background-color:yellow;">foo_list</span> " or " <span style="background-color:yellow;">foo_iter</span> " but it will quietly tolerate a singleton without breaking . 80 % of the code is the legacy ( " <span style="background-color:yellow;">foo</span> " or " <span style="background-color:yellow;">foo_list</span> " ) 20 % of the code is the new <span style="background-color:yellow;">feature</span> ( " <span style="background-color:yellow;">foo</span> " can be an <span style="background-color:yellow;">iterable</span> or " <span style="background-color:yellow;">foo_list</span> " can be a single object. ) </ol>
<br /><b># <span style="background-color:yellow;">1</span> </b><br /><p>It sounds like you 're agonizing over the ugliness of code like : </p>
<pre><code>def ProcessWidget(widget_thing):
  # Infer if we have a singleton instance and make it a
  # length 1 list for consistency
  if isinstance(widget_thing, WidgetType):
    widget_thing = [widget_thing]

  for widget in widget_thing:
    #...
</code></pre>
<p>My suggestion is to avoid overloading your interface to handle two distinct cases. I tend to write code that <span style="background-color:yellow;">favors</span> re-use and clear naming of methods over clever dynamic use of parameters : </p>
<pre><code>def ProcessOneWidget(widget):
  #...

def ProcessManyWidgets(widgets):
  for widget in widgets:
    ProcessOneWidget(widget)
</code></pre>
<p>Often , I start with this simple pattern , but then have the opportunity to optimize the " Many " case when there are efficiencies to gain that offset the additional code complexity and partial duplication of <span style="background-color:yellow;">functionality.</span> If this convention seems overly verbose , one can opt <span style="background-color:yellow;">for</span> names like " <span style="background-color:yellow;">ProcessWidget</span> " and " <span style="background-color:yellow;">ProcessWidgets</span> " , though the difference between the two is a single easily missed character . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>I guess I 'm a little late to the party , but I 'm suprised that nobody suggested a decorator . </p>
<pre><code>def withmany(f):
    def many(many_foos):
        for foo in many_foos:
            yield f(foo)
    f.many = many
    return f

@withmany
def process_foo(foo):
    return foo + 1


processed_foo = process_foo(foo)

for processed_foo in process_foo.many(foos):
    print processed_foo
</code></pre>
<p>I saw a similar pattern in one of Alex Martelli 's posts but I do n't remember the link off hand . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>Can you name your parameter in a very high-level way ? people who read the code are more interested in knowing what the parameter represents ( " clients " ) than what their type is ( " list_of_tuples " ) ; the type can be defined in the <span style="background-color:yellow;">function</span> documentation string , which is a good thing since it might change , in the <span style="background-color:yellow;">future</span> ( the type is sometimes an implementation detail ) . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>You can use * args magic ( varargs ) to make your params always be <span style="background-color:yellow;">iterable</span> . </p>
<p>Pass a single item or multiple known items as normal <span style="background-color:yellow;">function</span> args like <span style="background-color:yellow;">func</span> ( arg1 , arg2 , ... ) and pass <span style="background-color:yellow;">iterable</span> arguments with an asterisk before , like <span style="background-color:yellow;">func</span> ( * args ) </p>
<p>Example : </p>
<pre><code># magic *args function
def foo(*args):
    print args

# many ways to call it
foo(1)
foo(1, 2, 3)

args1 = (1, 2, 3)
args2 = [1, 2, 3]
args3 = iter((1, 2, 3))

foo(*args1)
foo(*args2)
foo(*args3)
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>I would go with a name explaining that the parameter can be an instance or a list of instances. Say one_or_more_Foo_objects . I <span style="background-color:yellow;">find</span> it better than the bland param . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>I would do <span style="background-color:yellow;">1</span> thing, </p>
<pre><code>def myFunc(manyFoos):
    if not type(manyFoos) in (list,tuple):
        manyFoos = [manyFoos]
    #do stuff here
</code></pre>
<p>so then you do n't need to worry anymore about its name . </p>
<p>in a <span style="background-color:yellow;">function</span> you should try to achieve to have <span style="background-color:yellow;">1</span> action , accept the same parameter type and return the same type . </p>
<p>Instead of <span style="background-color:yellow;">filling</span> the <span style="background-color:yellow;">functions</span> with ifs you could have 2 <span style="background-color:yellow;">functions</span> . </p>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>Since you do n't care exactly what kind of <span style="background-color:yellow;">iterable</span> you get , you could try to get an iterator <span style="background-color:yellow;">for</span> the parameter using iter ( ) . If iter ( ) raises a TypeError exception , the parameter is not <span style="background-color:yellow;">iterable</span> , so you then create a list or tuple of the one item , which is <span style="background-color:yellow;">iterable</span> and Bob 's your uncle . </p>
<pre><code>def doIt(foos):
    try:
        iter(foos)
    except TypeError:
        foos = [foos]
    for foo in foos:
        pass    # do something here
</code></pre>
<p>The only problem with this approach is if <span style="background-color:yellow;">foo</span> is a string. A string is <span style="background-color:yellow;">iterable</span> , so passing in a single string rather than a list of strings will result in iterating over the characters in a string. If this is a concern , you could add an if test <span style="background-color:yellow;">for</span> it. At this point it 's getting wordy <span style="background-color:yellow;">for</span> boilerplate code , so I 'd break it out into its own <span style="background-color:yellow;">function</span> . </p>
<pre><code>def iterfy(iterable):
    if isinstance(iterable, basestring):
        iterable = [iterable]
    try:
        iter(iterable)
    except TypeError:
        iterable = [iterable]
    return iterable

def doIt(foos):
    for foo in iterfy(foos):
        pass    # do something
</code></pre>
<p>Unlike some of those answering , I like doing this , since it eliminates one thing the caller could get wrong when using your API. " Be conservative in what you generate but liberal in what you accept. " </p>
<p>To answer your original question , i.e. what you should name the parameter , I would still go with " <span style="background-color:yellow;">foos</span> " even though you will accept a single item , since your intent is to accept a list. If it 's not <span style="background-color:yellow;">iterable</span> , that is technically a mistake , albeit one you will correct <span style="background-color:yellow;">for</span> the caller since processing just the one item is probably what they want. Also , if the caller thinks they must pass in an <span style="background-color:yellow;">iterable</span> even of one item , well , that will of course work <span style="background-color:yellow;">fine</span> and requires very little syntax , so why worry about correcting their misapprehension ? </p>
<br /><b># 8 </b><br /><p>I 'm working on a <span style="background-color:yellow;">fairly</span> big project now and we 're passing maps around and just calling our parameter map . The map contents vary depending on the <span style="background-color:yellow;">function</span> that 's being called. This probably is n't the best situation , but we reuse a lot of the same code on the maps , so copying and pasting is easier . </p>
<p>I would say instead of naming it what it is , you should name it what it 's used <span style="background-color:yellow;">for.</span> Also , just be careful that you ca n't call use in on a not <span style="background-color:yellow;">iterable</span> . </p>
