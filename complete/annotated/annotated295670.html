<h3>Question ( ID-295670 ) : </h3><h2>What is a partial class ? </h2><p>What is and how can it be used in C # . Can you use the same concept in Python/Perl ? </p>
<br /><h3><span style="background-color:yellow;">Answers</span> ( Total-7 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p><span style="background-color:yellow;">A</span> partial type ( it does n't have to be a class ; structs and interfaces can be partial too ) is basically a single type which has its code spread across multiple files . </p>
<p>The main use for this is to allow a code generator ( e.g. a Visual Studio designer ) to " own " one file , while hand-written code is put in another . </p>
<p>I 've no idea whether Python/Perl have the same capabilities , I 'm afraid . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>The c # partial class has been already explained here so I 'll just cover the python part. You can use multiple inheritance to elegantly distribute the definition of a class . </p>
<pre><code>class A_part1:
    def m1(self):
        print "m1"

class A_part2:
    def m2(self):
        print "m2"

class A(A_part1, A_part2):
    pass

a = A()
a.m1()
a.m2()
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p><span style="background-color:yellow;">A</span> partial class is simply a class that 's contained in more than one file. Sometimes it 's so that one part can be machine-generated , and another part user-edited . </p>
<p>I use them in C # when I 'm making a class that 's getting a bit too large. I 'll put the accessors and constructors in one file , and all of the interesting methods in a different file . </p>
<p>In Perl , you 'd simply have two ( or more ) files that each declare themselves to be in a package : </p>
<p>( main program ) </p>
<pre><code>    use MyClass;
</code></pre>
<p>( in MyClass.pm ) </p>
<pre><code>    use MyClassOtherStuff;
    package MyClass;
    # [..class code here...]
</code></pre>
<p>( in MyClassOtherStuff.pm ) </p>
<pre><code>    package MyClass;
    # [...rest of code here...]
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>The concept of partial types have already been explained . </p>
<p>This can be done in python. <span style="background-color:yellow;">As</span> an example , do the following in a python shell . </p>
<pre><code>class A(object):
    pass

obj = A()

def _some_method(self):
    print self.__class__
A.identify = _some_method

obj.identify()
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Because python is a dynamic language you do n't need a concept like partial class. In python is possible to extend <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> with functionality in runtime so it possible to break class declaration into different files </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p><span style="background-color:yellow;">A</span> Partial type is a type whose declaration is separated across multiple files. It makes sense to use them if you have a big class , which is hard to handle and read for a typical developer , to separate that class definition in separate files and to put in each file a logically separated section of code ( for instance all public methods and proprieties in one file , private in other , db handling code in third and so on.. ) </p>
<p>No you do n't have the same syntactical element in Python . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>Python also has meta classes but that is more like a template class than a partial class. <span style="background-color:yellow;">A</span> good example of meta class usage is the Django ORM. <span style="background-color:yellow;">All</span> of your table models inherit from a base model class which also gets functionality included from a meta class. It is a pretty cool concept that enables an active record like pattern ( is it full active record ? ) . </p>
