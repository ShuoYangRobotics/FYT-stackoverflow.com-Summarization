<h3>Question ( ID-192649 ) : </h3><h2>Can you monkey patch methods on core types in python ? </h2><p>Ruby can add methods to the Number class and other core types to get effects like : </p>
<pre>
1.should_equal(1)
</pre>
<p>But it seems like python can not do this. Is this true ? And if so , why ? Does it have something to do with the fact that type ca n't be modified ? </p>
<p>Update : Rather than talking about different definitions of monkey patching , I would like to just focus on the example above. I have already concluded that it can not be done as a few of you have answered. But I would like a more detailed explanation of why it can not be done , and maybe what feature , if available in python , would allow this . </p>
<p>To answer some of you : The reason I might want to do this is simply aesthetics/readability . </p>
<pre>
item.price.should_equal(19.99)
</pre>
<p>reads more like English and clearly indicates which is the tested value and which is the expected value , as supposed to : </p>
<pre>
should_equal(item.price, 19.99)
</pre>
<p>This concept is what Rspec and some other Ruby frameworks are based on . </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-11 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>No , you can not. In Python , all data ( classes , methods , functions , etc ) defined in C extension modules ( including builtins ) are immutable. This is because C modules are shared between multiple <span style="background-color:yellow;">interpreters</span> in the same process , so monkeypatching them would also affect unrelated <span style="background-color:yellow;">interpreters</span> in the same process . </p>
<p>However , classes defined in Python code may be monkeypatched because they are local to that <span style="background-color:yellow;">interpreter</span> . </p>
<br /><b># <span style="background-color:yellow;">1</span> </b><br /><p>What exactly do you mean by Monkey Patch here ? There are several slightly different definitions . </p>
<p>If you mean , " can you change a class 's methods at runtime ? " , then the answer is emphatically yes : </p>
<pre><code>class Foo:
  pass # dummy class

Foo.bar = lambda self: 42

x = Foo()
print x.bar()
</code></pre>
<p>If you mean , " can you change a class 's methods at runtime and make all of the instances of that class change after-the-fact ? " then the answer is yes as well. Just change the order slightly : </p>
<pre><code>class Foo:
  pass # dummy class

x = Foo()

Foo.bar = lambda self: 42

print x.bar()
</code></pre>
<p>But you ca n't do this for certain built-in classes , like <span style="background-color:yellow;">int</span> or <span style="background-color:yellow;">float</span> . These classes ' methods are implemented in C and there are certain abstractions sacrificed in order to make the implementation easier and more efficient . </p>
<p>I 'm not really clear on why you would want to alter the behavior of the built-in numeric classes anyway. If you need to alter their behavior , subclass them ! ! </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>Python 's core types are immutable by design , as other users have pointed out : </p>
<pre><code>>>> int.frobnicate = lambda self: whatever()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: can't set attributes of built-in/extension type 'int'
</code></pre>
<p>You certainly could achieve the effect you describe by making a subclass , since user-defined types in Python are mutable by default . </p>
<pre><code>>>> class MyInt(int):
...   def frobnicate(self):
...     print 'frobnicating %r' % self
... 
>>> five = MyInt(5)
>>> five.frobnicate()
frobnicating 5
>>> five + 8
13
</code></pre>
<p>There 's no need to make the <span style="background-color:yellow;">MyInt</span> subclass public , either ; one could just as well define it inline directly in the function or method that constructs the instance . </p>
<p>There are certainly a few situations where Python programmers who are fluent in the idiom consider this sort of subclassing the right thing to do. For instance , os.stat ( ) returns a tuple subclass that adds <span style="background-color:yellow;">named</span> members , precisely in order to address the sort of readability concern you refer to in your example . </p>
<pre><code>>>> import os
>>> st = os.stat('.')
>>> st
(16877, 34996226, 65024L, 69, 1000, 1000, 4096, 1223697425, 1223699268, 1223699268)
>>> st[6]
4096
>>> st.st_size
4096
</code></pre>
<p>That said , in the specific example you give , I do n't believe that subclassing <span style="background-color:yellow;">float</span> in <span style="background-color:yellow;">item.price</span> ( or elsewhere ) would be very likely to be considered the Pythonic thing to do. I can easily imagine somebody deciding to add a <span style="background-color:yellow;">price_should_equal</span> ( ) method to <span style="background-color:yellow;">item</span> if that were the primary use case ; if one were looking for something more general , perhaps it might make more sense to use <span style="background-color:yellow;">named</span> arguments to make the <span style="background-color:yellow;">intended</span> meaning clearer , as in </p>
<pre><code>should_equal(observed=item.price, expected=19.99)
</code></pre>
<p>or something along those lines. It 's a bit verbose , but no doubt it could be improved upon. A possible advantage to such an approach over Ruby-style monkey-patching is that <span style="background-color:yellow;">should_equal</span> ( ) could easily perform its comparison on any type , not just <span style="background-color:yellow;">int</span> or <span style="background-color:yellow;">float</span> . But perhaps I 'm getting too caught up in the details of the particular example that you happened to provide . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>No , you ca n't do that in Python. I consider it to be a good thing . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>What does <span style="background-color:yellow;">should_equal</span> do ? Is it a boolean returning True or False ? In that case , it 's spelled : </p>
<pre><code>item.price == 19.99
</code></pre>
<p>There 's no accounting for taste , but no regular python developer would say that 's less readable than your version . </p>
<p>Does <span style="background-color:yellow;">should_equal</span> instead set some sort of validator ? ( why would a validator be limited to one value ? Why not just set the value and not update it after that ? ) If you want a validator , this could never work anyway , since you 're proposing to modify either a particular <span style="background-color:yellow;">integer</span> or all <span style="background-color:yellow;">integers.</span> ( A validator that requires <span style="background-color:yellow;">18.99</span> to equal <span style="background-color:yellow;">19.99</span> will always fail. ) Instead , you could spell it like this : </p>
<pre><code>item.price_should_equal(19.99)
</code></pre>
<p>or this : </p>
<pre><code>item.should_equal('price', 19.99)
</code></pre>
<p>and define appropriate methods on <span style="background-color:yellow;">item</span> 's class or superclasses . </p>
<br /><b># <span style="background-color:yellow;">5</span> </b><br /><p>If you really really really want to do a monkey patch in Python , you can do a ( sortof ) hack with the " import foo as bar " technique . </p>
<p>If you have a class such as <span style="background-color:yellow;">TelnetConnection</span> , and you want to extend it , subclass it in a separate file and call it something like <span style="background-color:yellow;">TelnetConnectionExtended</span> . </p>
<p>Then , at the top of your code , where you would normally say : </p>
<pre><code>import TelnetConnection
</code></pre>
<p>change that to be : </p>
<pre><code>import TelnetConnectionExtended as TelnetConnection
</code></pre>
<p>and then everywhere in your code that you reference <span style="background-color:yellow;">TelnetConnection</span> will actually be referencing <span style="background-color:yellow;">TelnetConnectionExtended</span> . </p>
<p>Sadly , this assumes that you have access to that class , and the " as " only operates within that particular file ( it 's not a global-rename ) , but I 've found it to be useful from time to time . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>Here 's an example of implementing <span style="background-color:yellow;">item.price.should_equal</span> , although I 'd use Decimal instead of <span style="background-color:yellow;">float</span> in a real program : </p>
<pre><code>class Price(float):
    def __init__(self, val=None):
        float.__init__(self)
        if val is not None:
            self = val

    def should_equal(self, val):
        assert self == val, (self, val)

class Item(object):
    def __init__(self, name, price=None):
        self.name = name
        self.price = Price(price)

item = Item("spam", 3.99)
item.price.should_equal(3.99)
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><pre><code>def should_equal_def(self, value):
    if self != value:
        raise ValueError, "%r should equal %r" % (self, value)

class MyPatchedInt(int):
    should_equal=should_equal_def

class MyPatchedStr(str):
    should_equal=should_equal_def

import __builtin__
__builtin__.str = MyPatchedStr
__builtin__.int = MyPatchedInt

int(1).should_equal(1)
str("44").should_equal("44")
</code></pre>
<p>Have fun ; ) </p>
<br /><b># 8 </b><br /><p>No but you have UserDict UserString and UserList which were made with exactly this in mind . </p>
<p>If you google you will find examples for other types , but this are builtin . </p>
<p>In general monkey patching is less used in Python than in Ruby . </p>
<br /><b># 9 </b><br /><p>You ca n't patch core types in python . However , you could use <span style="background-color:yellow;">pipe</span> to write a more human readable code : </p>
<pre><code>from pipe import *

@Pipe
def should_equal(obj, val):
    if obj==val: return True
    return False

class dummy: pass
item=dummy()
item.value=19.99

print item.value | should_equal(19.99)
</code></pre>
<br /><b># <span style="background-color:yellow;">10</span> </b><br /><p>It seems what you really wanted to write is : </p>
<pre><code>assert item.price == 19.99
</code></pre>
<p>( Of course comparing <span style="background-color:yellow;">floats</span> for equality , or using <span style="background-color:yellow;">floats</span> for <span style="background-color:yellow;">prices</span> , is a bad idea , so you 'd write assert <span style="background-color:yellow;">item.price</span> = = Decimal ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">19.99</span> ) or whatever numeric class you were using for the <span style="background-color:yellow;">price.</span> ) </p>
<p>You could also use a testing framework like py.test to get more info on failing asserts in your tests . </p>
