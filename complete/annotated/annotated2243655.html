<h3>Question ( ID-2243655 ) : </h3><h2>reading <span style="background-color:yellow;">csv</span> file without for </h2><p>I need to read a CSV file in python . </p>
<p>Since for last row I receive a 'NULL byte ' error I would like to avoid using for keyword but the while . </p>
<p>Do you know how to do that ? </p>
<pre>
    reader = csv.reader( file )
    for row in reader  # I have an error at this line
          # do whatever with row
</pre>
<p>I want to substitute the for-loop with a while-loop so that I can check if the row is NULL or not . </p>
<p>What is the function for reading a single row in the CSV module ? Thanks </p>
<p>Thanks </p>
<p>p.S. below the traceback </p>
<pre>

<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-7 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>Maybe you could catch the exception raised by the CSV reader. Something like this : </p>
<pre><code>filename = "my.csv"
reader = csv.reader(open(filename))
try:
    for row in reader:
        print 'Row read with success!', row
except csv.Error, e:
    sys.exit('file %s, line %d: %s' % (filename, reader.line_num, e))
</code></pre>
<p>Or you could use next ( ) : </p>
<pre><code>while True:
    try: 
        print reader.next()
    except csv.Error:
        print "Error"
    except StopIteration:
        print "Iteration End"
        break
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>The Django community has addressed Python CSV import issues , so it might be worth searching for CSV import there , or posting a question. Also , you could edit the offending line directly in the CSV file before trying the import . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>You need ( always ) to say EXACTLY what is the error message that you got. Please edit your question . </p>
<p>Probably this : </p>
<pre><code>>>> import csv; csv.reader("\x00").next()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
_csv.Error: line contains NULL byte
>>>
</code></pre>
<p>The <span style="background-color:yellow;">csv</span> module is not 8-bit clean ; see the docs : " " " Also , there are currently some issues regarding ASCII NUL characters. " " " </p>
<p>The error message is itself in error : it should be " NUL " , not " NULL " : - ( </p>
<p>If the last line in the file is empty , you wo n't get an exception , you 'll merely get row = = [ ] . </p>
<p>Assuming the problem is one or more NULs in your file ( s ) , you 'll need to ( 1 ) speak earnestly to the creator ( s ) of your file ( s ) ( 2 ) failing that , read the whole file in ( mode = " rb " ) , strip out the NUL ( s ) , and feed fixed_text.splitlines ( ) to the <span style="background-color:yellow;">csv</span> reader . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>not really sure what you mean , but you can always check for existence with if </p>
<pre><code>>>> reader = csv.reader("file")
>>> for r  in reader:
...   if r: print r
...
</code></pre>
<p>if this is not what you want , you should describe your problem more clearly by showing examples of things that does n't work for you , including sample file format and desired output you want . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>If your problem is specific to the last line being empty , you can use numpy.genfromtxt ( or the old matplotlib.mlab.csv2rec ) </p>
<pre><code>$: cat >csv_file.txt
foo,bar,baz
yes,no,0
x,y,z



$:
$: ipython
>>> from numpy import genfromtxt
>>> genfromtxt("csv_file.txt", dtype=None, delimiter=',')
array([['foo', 'bar', 'baz'],
       ['yes', 'no', '0'],
       ['x', 'y', 'z']], 
      dtype='|S3')
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>I do n't have an answer , but I can confirm the problem , and that most answers posted do n't work. You can not catch this exception. You can not test for if line . Maybe you could check for the NULL byte directly , but I 'm not swift enough to do that... If it is always on the last line , you could of course skip that . </p>
<pre><code>import csv
FH = open('data.csv','wb')
line1 = [97,44,98,44,99,10]
line2 = [100,44,101,44,102,10]
for n in line1 + line2:
    FH.write(chr(n))
FH.write(chr(0))
FH.close()
FH = open('data.csv')
reader = csv.reader(FH)
for line in reader:
    if '\0' in line:  continue
    if not line:  continue
    print line

$ python script.py 
['a', 'b', 'c']
['d', 'e', 'f']

<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>You could try cleaning the file as you read it : </p>
<pre><code>def nonull(stream):
    for line in stream:
        yield line.replace('\x00', '')

f = open(filename)
reader = csv.reader(nonull(f))
</code></pre>
<p>Assuming , of course , that simply ignoring NULL characters will work for you ! </p>
