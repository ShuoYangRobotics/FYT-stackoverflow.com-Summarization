<h3>Question ( ID-3145897 ) : </h3><h2>Why does this simple Python script reveal the incorrect answer ? </h2><p>I 'm again working on Project Euler , this time problem # 4. The point of this script is to find the largest palindromic product of two three digit numbers. I thought it was fairly straightforward to solve , but I 'm getting an answer that is too low. More specifically , I am getting 580085 , and the answer is 906609 . </p>
<p>Could someone tell me what about this is incorrect ? </p>

<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-6 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>Your <span style="background-color:yellow;">code</span> does n't make sure it prints the largest product , since there <span style="background-color:yellow;">could</span> later be a smaller product which replaces it. To fix it , initialize t to <span style="background-color:yellow;">zero</span> , and replace your <span style="background-color:yellow;">condition</span> with </p>
<pre><code>if z==s and int(z)>t:
    t = int(z)
</code></pre>
<p>Or equivalently, </p>
<pre><code>if z==s:
    t = max(t,int(z))
</code></pre>
<p>Edit : Fixed int/string issues above. It 's a bit <span style="background-color:yellow;">cleaner</span> to avoid the <span style="background-color:yellow;">conversion</span> to string and back to int like this though : </p>
<pre><code>def isPalindrome(x):
    s = str(x)
    return s == s[::-1]

t = 0
for x in range(100, 1000):
    for y in range(100, 1000):
        z = x * y
        if isPalindrome(z) and z > t:
            t = z
print t
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>Here 's a tricky but <span style="background-color:yellow;">correct</span> way to do it in a single expression... : </p>
<pre><code>def main():
  print max(p for x in range(100, 1000) for y in range(x, 1000)
              for p in (x * y,) if str(p) == str(p)[::-1])
</code></pre>
<p>The tricky part is the single-item for p <span style="background-color:yellow;">clause</span> which plays the role of an assignment ( just to stop recomputing that product several times ; - ) . </p>
<p>Note that the accepted answer is wrong ( as are several others ) , because it looks for the string " max " , which is different from the int max -- try running it , and you 'll see ! - ) </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>The problem is to find the largest palindrome. You have nothing here to find the largest , simply the last. You assumed the last one would be the largest , but that is n't so because you are examining the entire ZxZ square of possibilities . </p>
<p>For example , you are <span style="background-color:yellow;">considering</span> 200 * 101 after you 've <span style="background-color:yellow;">considered</span> 101 * 999 . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>You need to add a <span style="background-color:yellow;">check</span> if the one you found is larger than the one you already have . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Because of the way you 're using the 2 for loops you 're going to get the number with the largest <span style="background-color:yellow;">x</span> value , not the largest product . </p>
<p>906609 = 993 * 913 </p>
<p>Then <span style="background-color:yellow;">x</span> keeps incrementing and the next palindrome is : </p>
<p>580085 = 995 * 583 </p>
<p>You need a variable to keep track of the largest palindrome you 've found . </p>
<pre><code>def main():
    largest = 0
    for x in range(100, 1000):
        for y in range(100, 1000):
            z = str( x * y )
            s = str( z[::-1] ) # Reverse z
            if z == s:
                t = int(z)
                if t > largest:
                    largest = t
    print largest
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>I 'll add that you <span style="background-color:yellow;">can</span> save yourself some time in this test. All 6 digit palindromes must be divisible by 11. Therefore at least one of the factors must be divisible by 11 . </p>
