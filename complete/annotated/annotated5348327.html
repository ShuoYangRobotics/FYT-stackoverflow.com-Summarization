<h3>Question ( ID-5348327 ) : </h3><h2>How to shorten this expression using <span style="background-color:yellow;">regex</span> </h2><p>I have the following if statement : </p>
<pre><code>if not fileName.startswith(".") and re.search("(.exe|.EXE)$", fileName) is not None and not fileName.endswith("-xyz.exe"):
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>Essentially , I would like to check that the filename does not start with a period and ends with either .exe or .EXE extension , but not with the -xyz.exe extension. How can I get rid of the startswith and endswith and combine those two checks into the <span style="background-color:yellow;">regex</span> itself . </p>
<p>UPDATE : I ask because I want to learn more about <span style="background-color:yellow;">regex.</span> Depending on the <span style="background-color:yellow;">readability</span> , I will determine if that would be worth making it more concise or not . </p>
<p>UPDATE 2 : I ran into this situation. I always look for opportunities to learn more about <span style="background-color:yellow;">regex.</span> This seems like a good opportunity , so I TRIED to do it MYSELF FIRST until I got stuck. Please do not give non-regex solution or echo Mark Pilgrim 's statement about " now you have 2 problems " , because anyone could have done that. Instead , prove it to me that now I have 2 problems , just like Mark Pilgrim continued with his lesson. Or show me that it 's slick . </p>

<p>Edit : After <span style="background-color:yellow;">reading</span> your question a bit closer , it appears you are concerned with the case of the EXE. In that case the <span style="background-color:yellow;">regex</span> can easily handle that , too : </p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>if re.search(

<p>Edit2 : John Machin has pointed out that with Python , when you are looking for a match that can only occur at the start of a target string , then using the ^ start of string assertion with the <span style="background-color:yellow;">re.search</span> method is much slower than using <span style="background-color:yellow;">re.match</span> ( and is considered bad practice ) . With that in mind , here is an improved version : </p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>if re.match(
    r"""# Always use VERBOSE when composing non-trivial regex!
    # Apply multiple lookahead assertions from string start:
    (?!\.)                # Assert does not begin with dot.
    (?=.*\.(?:exe|EXE)$)  # Assert DOES end with .EXE or .exe
    (?!.*-xyz\.exe$)      # Assert does NOT end with -xyz-exe
    .*                    # Ok to match the filename (optional).

    subject, re.VERBOSE):

<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>I would n't use a <span style="background-color:yellow;">regexp</span> , just wrap that onto multiple lines and make it a little smarter : </p>
<pre><code>if not filename.startswith(".") \
   and filename.lower().endswith(".exe") \
   and not filename.endswith("-xyz.exe"):
    #do stuff
</code></pre>
<p>Do note that this is slightly different in that * .eXe , * .eXE and other mixed case versions of the extension would then be ignored as well , unlike in the original. But I 'm betting that it does n't <span style="background-color:yellow;">really</span> matter and that my test is better . </p>
<p>edit : fixed the " .exe " part because I had the condition flipped , but if you 're trying to learn <span style="background-color:yellow;">regular</span> expressions this is a weird contrived example and I think it 's best not to try and shoehorn <span style="background-color:yellow;">regular</span> expressions as a solution to a problem where it 's not a good solution </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>You need to use a negative lookbehind assertion : </p>
<pre><code>import re

regex = '[^.].*(?:(?<!-xyz).exe|.EXE)'

vectors = (
  '.123.dat',
  '.123.exe',
  '.123.EXE',
  '123.dat',
  '123.exe',
  '123.EXE',
  '.123-xyz.dat',
  '.123-xyz.exe',
  '.123-xyz.EXE',
  '123-xyz.dat',
  '123-xyz.exe',
  '123-xyz.EXE',
)

for v in vectors:
  print "%s: " % (v,),
  if (bool(re.match(regex, v)) == (not v.startswith(".") and
      re.search("(.exe|.EXE)$", v) is not None and
      not v.endswith("-xyz.exe"))):
    print 'PASS'
  else:
    print 'FAIL'

<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>Learn to use elementary <span style="background-color:yellow;">regular</span> expressions before you start trying to " shorten " your code . </p>
<p>This piece <span style="background-color:yellow;">re.search</span> ( " ( .exe | .EXE ) $ " , fileName ) has THREE deficiencies : </p>
<p>( 1 ) Should use raw strings by habit , even when it makes no difference , because then you ( and your <span style="background-color:yellow;">readers</span> ) do n't need to spend time nutting out whether it matters or not . </p>
<p>( 2 ) Unescaped . matches ANY character ( except a newline ( in the default case ) ) . </p>
<p>( 3 ) $ matches before a newline at the end of a string ; you should use \ Z instead. If you do n't , foo.exe \ n ( easy enough to get by mistake if your input was supplied by someone who did n't strip the \ n ) will match . </p>
<p>What you need is <span style="background-color:yellow;">re.search</span> ( r " ( \ .exe | \ .EXE ) \ Z " , fileName ) </p>
<p>Update for the benefit of anyone who thinks that <span style="background-color:yellow;">re.search</span> ( " ^ blahblah " , ... ) is a good idea : </p>

<p>EDIT : </p>
<p>You are right , ridgerunner , [ ^ . ] is better than ( ? ! \ . ) : it 's more <span style="background-color:yellow;">readable</span> , more logic and slightly faster , -4 % ( I tested ) </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>I also compared ' ( ? ! \ . ) . + ? \ . ( ? : EXE | ( ? &lt ; ! -xyz ) exe ) \ Z ' ( there is . + ? instead of . + ) </p>
<p>With this RE , execution is longer . The additional time depends of the number of dots in the tested names . </p>
<p>On names like '78999.abc.juty.123.dat ' it is around 15 % longer , and on names like '123.dat ' it 's 3 % longer . I think the <span style="background-color:yellow;">reason</span> is that the <span style="background-color:yellow;">regex</span> motor examine after each <span style="background-color:yellow;">reading</span> of a character if the <span style="background-color:yellow;">read</span> character is a dot or not . </p>
<p>On the contrary , with '. + \ . ' the <span style="background-color:yellow;">regex</span> motor goes until the end , and then come back to search the last dot. I think it is a correct explanation because , if the RE ' ( ? ! \ . ) . + ? \ . ( ? : EXE | ( ? &lt ; ! -xyz ) exe ) \ Z ' is tested on names like '123.teybertyhbeythbeytberyetynetynetnyetnydat ' , the time is again longer ( + 30 % ) </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>I <span style="background-color:yellow;">realized</span> that my RE is very similar to the Ignacio 's one , and I wondered why I wrote this RE as it seems to have no particular interest. In fact , at the beginning , my idea was to write ' ( ? ! \ . ) . + ? ( ? &lt ; = .EXE | ( ? &lt ; ! -xyz ) .exe ) \ Z ' and then I wrote another string. By the way , with this abandonned RE , the execution time is 25 % longer on short names and 74 % longer on long names . </p>
<p>Finally , when I tested the execution times , Ignacio 's solution is 25 % longer on short names ( '123.dat ' ) and 47 % longer on long names ( '78999.abc.juty.123.dat ' ) </p>
<p>Best <span style="background-color:yellow;">regex</span> is then </p>
<pre><code>pat = re.compile('[^.]'
                 '.+'
                 '\.'
                 '(?:(?<!-xyz\.)exe|EXE)'
                 '\Z') 
</code></pre>
<p>I let '. + ' , not <span style="background-color:yellow;">replaced</span> by '. * ' , because there must be at least 4 characters in the name if we want the name to end with '.exe ' or '.EXE' </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>That will involve accessing every file that does n't start with '. ' or ends with '-xyz.exe'. The <span style="background-color:yellow;">regex</span> module can not parse stuff outside its namespace. I do n't think it 's possible , but have you tried checking the module 's doc ? </p>
