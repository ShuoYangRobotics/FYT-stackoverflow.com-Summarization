<h3>Question ( ID-2182082 ) : </h3><h2>python style question around reading small files </h2><p>What is the most pythonic way to read in a named file , strip <span style="background-color:yellow;">lines</span> that are either empty , contain only spaces , or have # as a first character , and then process remaining <span style="background-color:yellow;">lines</span> ? Assume it all fits easily in memory . </p>
<p>Note : it 's not tough to do this -- what I 'm asking is for the most pythonic way. I 've been writing a lot of Ruby and Java and have lost my feel . </p>
<p>Here 's a strawman : </p>
<pre><code>file_lines = [line.strip() for line in open(config_file, 'r').readlines() if len(line.strip()) > 0]
for line in file_lines:
  if line[0] == '#':
    continue
  # Do whatever with line here.
</code></pre>
<p>I 'm interested in concision , but not at the cost of becoming hard to read . </p>

<pre><code>def RemoveComments(lines):
    for line in lines:
        if not line.strip().startswith('#'):
            yield line

def RemoveBlankLines(lines):
    for line in lines:
        if line.strip():
            yield line
</code></pre>
<p>Now applying these to your file : </p>
<pre><code>filehandle = open('myfile', 'r')
for line in RemoveComments(RemoveBlankLines(filehandle)):
    Process(line)
</code></pre>
<p>In this case , it 's pretty clear that the two generators can be merged into a single one , but I left them separate to demonstrate their composability . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><pre><code>lines = [r for r in open(thefile) if not r.isspace() and r[0] != '#']
</code></pre>
<p>The .isspace ( ) method of strings is by far the best way to test if a string is entirely whitespace -- no need for contortions such as len ( r.strip ( ) ) = = 0 ( ech ; - ) . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><pre><code>for line in open("file"):
    sline=line.strip()
    if sline and not sline[0]=="#" :
       print line.strip()
</code></pre>
<p>output </p>
<pre><code>$ cat file
one
#

two

three
$ ./python.py
one
two

<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>I would use this : </p>
<pre><code>processed = [process(line.strip())
             for line in open(config_file, 'r')
             if line.strip() and not line.strip().startswith('#')]
</code></pre>
<p>The only ugliness I see here is all the repeated stripping. Getting rid of it complicates the function a bit : </p>
<pre><code>processed = [process(line)
             for line in (line.strip() for line in open(config_file, 'r'))
             if line and not line.startswith('#')]
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>This matches the description , ie </p>
<blockquote>strip <span style="background-color:yellow;">lines</span> that are either empty , contain only spaces , or have # as a first character , and then process remaining <span style="background-color:yellow;">lines</span> </blockquote>
<p>So <span style="background-color:yellow;">lines</span> that start or end in spaces are passed through unfettered . </p>
<pre><code>with open("config_file","r") as fp:
    data = (line for line in fp if line.strip() and not line.startswith("#"))
    for item in data:
        print repr(item)
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>I like Paul Hankin 's thinking , but I 'd do it differently : </p>
<pre><code>from itertools import ifilter, ifilterfalse, imap

with open(r'c:\temp\testfile.txt', 'rb') as f:
    s1 = ifilterfalse(str.isspace, f)
    s2 = ifilter(lambda x: not x.startswith('#'), s1)
    s3 = imap(str.rstrip, s2)
    print "\n".join(s3)
</code></pre>
<p>I 'd probably only do it this way instead of using some of the more obvious approaches suggested here if I were concerned about memory usage. And I might define an iscomment function to eliminate the lambda . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>The file is small , so performance is not really an issue. I will go for clarity than conciseness : </p>
<pre><code>fp = open('file.txt')
for line in fp:
    line = line.strip()
    if line and not line.startswith('#'):
        # process
fp.close()
</code></pre>
<p>If you want , you can wrap this in a function . </p>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>Using slightly newer idioms ( or with Python 2.5 from __future__ import with ) you could do this , which has the advantage of cleaning up safely yet is quite concise . </p>
<pre><code>with file('file.txt') as fp:
    for line in fp:
        line = line.strip()
        if not line or line[0] == '#':
            continue

        # rest of processing here
</code></pre>
<p>Note that stripping the <span style="background-color:yellow;">line</span> first means the check for " # " will actually reject <span style="background-color:yellow;">lines</span> with that as the first non-blank , not merely " as first character " . Easy enough to modify if you 're strict about that . </p>
