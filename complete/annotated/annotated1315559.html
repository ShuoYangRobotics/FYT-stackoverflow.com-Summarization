False

<p>EDIT : You say you " know " that <span style="background-color:yellow;">text</span> is not empty... how confident are you of that , and what would you want to happen if it is empty in reality ? If a failure is appropriate ( e.g. it means a bug in your code ) that would encourage the use of <span style="background-color:yellow;">text</span> [ 0 ] = = 'a ' . </p>
<p>Other questions : </p>
<ul>How concerned are you about the performance of this ? If this is performance critical , then benchmark it on your particular Python runtime . I would n't be entirely surprised to find that ( say ) one form was faster on IronPython and a different one faster on CPython . Which do you ( and your team ) find more readable ? </ul>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>Yes: it’s easier to use and easier to read. When you are testing for more than one letter, when using slicing, you’ll have to know how long the target text is:</p>
<pre><code>haystack = 'Hello, World!'
needle = 'Hello'

# The easy way
result = haystack.startswith(needle)

# The slightly harder way
result = haystack[:len(needle)] == needle
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> The question seems to have changed. It now says, “knowing text is not empty and we are only interested in the first character of it.” That turns it into a fairly meaningless hypothetical situation.</p>

<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>Personally I would say <span style="background-color:yellow;">startswith</span> is more readable . </p>
<p>Also , from Python 2.5 startwith can take a tuple of prefixes to look for : </p>
<pre><code>>>> "hello world".startswith(("hello","goodbye"))
True
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>The stock phrase for the questiom is : " Premature optimization is the root of all evil " . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>I 'd agree with the others that <span style="background-color:yellow;">startswith</span> is more readable , and you should use that. That said , if performance is a big issue for such a special case , benchmark it : </p>
<pre><code>$ python -m timeit -s 'text="foo"' 'text.startswith("a")'
1000000 loops, best of 3: 0.537 usec per loop

$ python -m timeit -s 'text="foo"' 'text[0]=="a"'
1000000 loops, best of 3: 0.22 usec per loop
</code></pre>
<p>So <span style="background-color:yellow;">text</span> [ 0 ] is amost 2.5 times as fast - but it 's a pretty quick operation ; you 'd save ~ 0.3 microseconds per compare depending on the system. Unless you 're doing millions of comparisons in a time critical situation though , I 'd still go with the more readable <span style="background-color:yellow;">startswith</span> . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p><span style="background-color:yellow;">text</span> [ 0 ] can fail but the equivalent <span style="background-color:yellow;">text</span> [ : 1 ] is safe if the string is empty . </p>
<p>If you want to compare more than one characters , I believe .startswith ( ) is better . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>Instead of asking you can just write a quick test and see which one 's faster . And then let us know . Ofcourse you 'll have to add to <span style="background-color:yellow;">text</span> [ 0 ] the check that the string is n't empty . </p>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p><span style="background-color:yellow;">text</span> [ 0 ] = = 'a ' is good considering performance. Also you need to add validation when you use this . </p>
<br /><b># 8 </b><br /><p>PEP 8 explicitly tells to use <span style="background-color:yellow;">startswith</span> , because of readability : </p>
<blockquote>- Use ''.startswith ( ) and ''.endswith ( ) instead of string slicing to check for prefixes or suffixes . <span style="background-color:yellow;">startswith</span> ( ) and endswith ( ) are cleaner and less error prone. For example : Yes : if foo.startswith ( 'bar ' ) : No : if foo [ : 3 ] = = 'bar ' : </blockquote>
