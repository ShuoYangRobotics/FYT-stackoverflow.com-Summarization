<h3>Question ( ID-7586221 ) : </h3><h2>Program not entering if statement </h2><p>In my python program , an if statement is not being entered. I have simplified the code to the following : </p>
<pre><code>x = -5
while x < 5:
    if (x == 0):
        print 0
    x += .01
</code></pre>
<p>This program does not output anything . </p>
<p>However , changing the last line to x + = .5 makes the program output 0. What 's the problem ? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-7 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>Floating point number representation might not be accurate enough. You should never test for zero equality but instead use something along </p>
<pre><code>if (abs(x) < 1E-10) ...
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>Behold the power of the print statement.. . </p>
<p>Let us insert a print statement.. . </p>
<pre><code>x = -5
while x < 5:
    if (x == 0):
        print 0
    x += .01
    print x
</code></pre>
<p>Running this program , and inspecting the output around 0 reveals the problem : </p>

<p>Oh boy , it is never actually equal to zero ! </p>
<p>Solutions : </p>
<ol>Use integers. Most reliable . x = -500 # times this by a 100 to make it an integer-based program while x &lt ; 500 : if ( x = = 0 ) : print 0 x + = 1 Never test equality with floating point arithmetic , but rather use a range : delta = 0.00001 # how close do you need to get point = 0 # point we are interested in if ( point-delta ) &lt ; = x &lt ; = ( point + delta ) : # do stuff </ol>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>This is a rounding issue - <span style="background-color:yellow;">decimal</span> values can not be represented exactly in binary , so x never exactly equals 0.0000000000... . </p>
<p>try replacing if ( x = = 0 ) : with if -0.001 &lt ; x &lt ; 0.001 : </p>
<p>BTW , the parentheses are unnecessary in a python if statement . </p>
<p>edit : Printing out the values between -1 and 1 in steps of 0.01 shows this is the case - where zero should be it prints 7.52869988574e-16 . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>Others have pointed out the issue with floating-point numbers being unable to represent values exactly. If you need exact <span style="background-color:yellow;">decimal</span> representation of a number , you can use the <span style="background-color:yellow;">Decimal</span> class : </p>
<pre><code>from decimal import Decimal

x = Decimal(-5)
while x < 5:
    if (x == 0):
        print 0
    x += Decimal(".01")
</code></pre>
<p>This will print 0 as you expect . </p>
<p>Note the use of a string for the increment. If you used <span style="background-color:yellow;">Decimal</span> ( .01 ) you 'd have the same problem with accurate representation of 0.01 , because you 're converting from a floating-point number and have already lost the accuracy , so the class does n't allow that . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>In binary , .01 has no exact representation but .5 does . </p>
<p>It 's the same problem you 'd have in <span style="background-color:yellow;">decimal</span> if you represented 1/3 as .333333 and kept adding 1/3 until you reached 1. After three additions , you 'd have .999999 which is not exactly equal to 1 . </p>
<p>Do n't compare non-integers for equality unless you precisely understand the rules for doing so and are 100 % sure your case is one of the ones that will work . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><pre><code>-0.01
7.52869988574e-16
0.01
</code></pre>
<p>I suggest you say x &gt ; -.001 and x &lt ; .001 or something of the sort </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>To be precise to your query , floating point numbers are stored in computer hardware in binary ( base 2 ) fractions. So even if you store some floating point like 0.01 in a variable , the computer would ultimately convert that into it 's equivalent binary value. For your convenience , conversion of 0.01 float to binary : </p>
<pre><code>0.01 * 2 = 0.02 [0]
0.02 * 2 = 0.04 [0] 
0.04 * 2 = 0.08 [0]
0.08 * 2 = 0.16 [0]
0.16 * 2 = 0.32 [0]
0.32 * 2 = 0.64 [0]
0.64 * 2 = 1.28 [0]
0.28 * 2 = 0.56 [0]
0.56 * 2 = 1.12 [1]
...
</code></pre>
<p>This calculation would be too lengthy to show here in full and probably wo n't end at all. But the fact i want to state here is that , most fractional <span style="background-color:yellow;">decimals</span> can not be exactly converted into binary fractions. As a result , the <span style="background-color:yellow;">decimal</span> point you store will be approximated by the binary floating fractions stored in the machine ( which obviously ca n't store very very long binary value ) . So when the calculation is done with that value , you certainly should n't expect the accurate floating value. That 's the case with putting x + = 0.01 in your code . However conversion of 0.5 to it 's binary equivalent would give : </p>
<pre><code>0.5 * 2 = 1.0 [1]
</code></pre>
<p>So binary equivalent of 0.5 float is 0.1 . Since it is perfectly represented in binary in your machine. You would get the exact result . </p>
<p>It has nothing to do with your code or python. It 's just the way computer hardware works : ) </p>
