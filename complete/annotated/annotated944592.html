<h3>Question ( ID-944592 ) : </h3><h2>Best practice for Python Assert </h2><p>Is there a performance or code maintenance issue with using assert as part of the standard code instead of using it just for debugging purposes ? </p>
<p>Is </p>
<pre><code>assert x >= 0, 'x is less then zero'
</code></pre>
<p>and better or worse then </p>
<pre><code>if x < 0:
    raise Exception, 'x is less then zero'
</code></pre>
<p>Also , is there anyway to set a business rule like if <span style="background-color:yellow;">x</span> &lt ; 0 raise error that is always checked with out the try , except , finally so , if at anytime throughout the code <span style="background-color:yellow;">x</span> is &lt ; 0 an error is raised , like if you set assert <span style="background-color:yellow;">x</span> &lt ; 0 at the start of a function , anywhere within the function where <span style="background-color:yellow;">x</span> becomes less then 0 an exception is raised ? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-7 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>Asserts should be used to test conditions that should never happen . The purpose is to crash early in the case of a corrupt program state . </p>
<p><span style="background-color:yellow;">Exceptions</span> should be used for errors that can conceivably happen , and you should almost always create your own <span style="background-color:yellow;">Exception</span> classes . </p>
<p></p>
<p>For example , if you 're writing a function to read from a configuration file into a dict , improper formatting in the file should raise a ConfigurationSyntaxError , while you can assert that you 're not about to return None . </p>
<p></p>
<p>In your example , if <span style="background-color:yellow;">x</span> is a value set via a user interface or from an external source , an exception is best . </p>
<p>If <span style="background-color:yellow;">x</span> is only set by your own code in the same program , go with an assertion . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>" assert " statements are removed when the compilation is optimized . So , yes , there are both performance and functional differences . </p>
<blockquote>The current code generator emits no code for an assert statement when optimization is requested at compile time. - Python 2.6.4 Docs </blockquote>
<p>If you use assert to implement application functionality , then optimize the deployment to production , you will be plagued by " but-it-works-in-dev " defects . </p>
<p>See PYTHONOPTIMIZE and -O -OO </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>To be able to automatically throw an error when <span style="background-color:yellow;">x</span> become less than zero throughout the function. You can use class descriptors . Here is an example : </p>
<pre><code>class ZeroException(Exception):
    pass

class variable(object):
    def __init__(self, value=0):
        self.__x = value

    def __set__(self, obj, value):
        if value < 0:
            raise ZeroException('x is less than zero')

        self.__x  = value

    def __get__(self, obj, objType):
        return self.__x

class MyClass(object):
    x = variable()

>>> m = MyClass()
>>> m.x = 10
>>> m.x -= 20
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "my.py", line 7, in __set__
    raise ZeroException('x is less than zero')
ZeroException: x is less than zero
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>The only thing that 's really wrong with this approach is that it 's hard to make a very descriptive exception using assert statements. If you 're looking for the simpler syntax , remember you can also do something like this : </p>
<pre><code>class XLessThanZeroException(Exception):
    pass

def CheckX(x):
    if x < 0:
        raise XLessThanZeroException()

def foo(x):
    CheckX(x)
    #do stuff here
</code></pre>
<p>Another problem is that using assert for normal condition-checking is that it makes it difficult to disable the debugging asserts using the -O flag . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>In addition to the other answers , asserts themselves throw exceptions , but only AssertionErrors. From a utilitarian standpoint , assertions are n't suitable for when you need fine grain control over which exceptions you catch . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>There 's a framework called JBoss Drools for java that does runtime monitoring to assert business rules , which answers the second part of your question. However , I am unsure if there is such a framework for python . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>Well , in general I agree with Deestan , but sometimes we need to test our custom exception , so.. . </p>
<p>we can take unittest 's method assertRaises , rewrite it a little - and get asserNotRaises method : </p>
<pre><code>class SomeTest(unittest.TestCase):
    def assertNotRaises(self, excClass, callableObj, *args, **kwargs):
        try:
            callableObj(*args, **kwargs)
        except excClass:
            if hasattr(excClass,'__name__'): excName = excClass.__name__
            else: excName = str(excClass)
            raise self.failureException, "%s raised" % excName
</code></pre>
<p>And then to use it like this : </p>
<pre><code>self.assertNotRaises(MyException, my_callable)
</code></pre>
