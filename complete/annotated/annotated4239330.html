<h3>Question ( ID-4239330 ) : </h3><h2>Think Python ( How to think like a computer scientist ) - Excercise 8.4 </h2><p>I 'm having some trouble solving the problem below ( My thinking on how I might solve it is directly beneath the problem ) </p>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<p>This loop outputs these names in order : </p>
<pre><code>prefixes = 'JKLMNOPQ' 
suffix = 'ack'
for letter in prefixes:
    print letter + suffix
</code></pre>
<p>The output is : </p>
<pre><code>Jack
Kack
Lack
Mack
Nack
Oack
Pack
Qack
</code></pre>
<p></p>
<p>Exercise 8.2 Modify the program to fix this error. " </p>
<p>So prefix + suffix yields 4 characters in its current form. Ouack and Quack are 5 characters. In the prior section , we used 'while ' to transverse a string to create a condition where if the index is equal to the length of the string , the condition is false , and the body of the loop is not executed. I 'm thinking I need to modify the for loop so that if the output character count is less than the original string value inputted , it adds the letter 'U'. How do I go about relating the length of the string value inputted for each name and the 'prefixes ' ? </p>
<p>I 'm not sure how I 'd go about doing this , or if I should persue a different strategy . </p>
<p>I apologize in advance I 've butchered any of the terminology , I 'm two days into this book , and I have no prior computer science background . </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-7 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>I think you 're overthinking this. You just need to check within the loop if the current letter is O or Q , and if so add a U . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><pre><code>>>> for letter in prefixes:
        if letter in ('O', 'Q'):  # if the letter is O or Q
            print letter + 'u' + suffix
        else:
            print letter + suffix

<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>My solution would be : </p>
<pre><code>prefixes = list('JKLMNP')
prefixes.extend(['Ou', 'Qu'])
suffix = 'ack'
for pref in prefixes:
    print pref + suffix
</code></pre>
<p>It is compact and contains very few modifications of the original . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>I like data-driven code : </p>
<pre><code>endings = ['ack', 'uack']
specials = ['O','Q']
prefixes = 'JKLMNOPQ'
suffixes = dict(zip(prefixes, [endings[p in specials] for p in prefixes]))
for letter in prefixes:
    print letter + suffixes[letter]
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>I prefer the Gordian Knot approach : </p>
<pre><code>print '\n'.join(['Jack', 'Kack', 'Lack', 'Mack', 'Nack', 'Ouack', 'Pack', 'Quack'])
</code></pre>
<p>Strictly speaking , that 's just a ( somewhat radical ) modification . </p>
<p>Stuff that , Perl guy . </p>
<p>All kidding aside , you could do it as the others have mentioned by special casing the " O " and " Q " . A ( very ) slightly more general approach is to think of the extra vowels not as a special case but rather as the only " visible " members of a general case : </p>
<pre><code>suffixes = ['ack'] * 8
prefixes = 'JKLMNOPQ'
infixes = ',,,,,u,,u'.split(',')
</code></pre>
<p>The split of the infixes string returns empty strings surrounding the consecutive commas , so the 'u 's are the only non-empty elements and they fall in the right places for the final <span style="background-color:yellow;">result</span> . </p>
<p>This makes three iterables ( think lists , but strings count too ) where all of the parts are lined up in the correct slots. This is enough of a shift that you can trade the old loop for a zip , which is probably not the intent of the exercise but is still a pythonic technique. Now you just need to run a zipper down the three , which is what the zip function is for , of course . </p>
<p>The only wrinkle is that zip gives you a out a list of string <span style="background-color:yellow;">pairs</span> and we want whole strings , which is what a ''.join is for. They are processed by a list comprehension , which you will definitely want to learn if you do n't already know : </p>
<pre><code>result = [''.join(pair) for pair in zip(infixes, suffixes)]
result = [''.join(pair) for pair in zip(prefixes, result)]
</code></pre>
<p>All that is left is to print : </p>
<pre><code>print '\n'.join(result)
</code></pre>
<p>To paraphrase a great man , my disclaimer : In theory , I can prove the correctness of this code , but I have not run it , so there may be bugs . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><pre><code>suffix = 'ack'
prefixes = list('JKLMNP')
prefixes += ['Qu', 'Ou']
prefixes.sort()

for prefix in prefixes:
    print prefix + suffix
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>Being a Perl guy I could n't help but give you a shorter solution than everyone else 's : p </p>
<pre><code>prefixes = 'JKLMNOPQ' 
suffix = 'ack'
for letter in prefixes:
 if letter in ('O','Q'):
  letter+="u"
 print letter+suffix
</code></pre>
<p>PS : I take it that the exercise was to modify the given code rather than to revamp it , otherwise there are ways of shrinking it further , within the confines of PEP8 that is : ) </p>
