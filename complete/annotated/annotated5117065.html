<h3>Question ( ID-5117065 ) : </h3><h2>Code-style for indent of multi-line IF statement in Python ? </h2><p>When indenting long if conditions , you usually do something like this ( actually , PyDev indents like that ) : </p>
<pre><code>if (collResv.repeatability is None or
    collResv.somethingElse):
    collResv.rejected = True
    collResv.rejectCompletely()
</code></pre>
<p>However , this puts the block started by the if statement on the same indentation level as the last part of the if condition which makes it very ugly/hard to read in my opinion as you do n't immediately see where the block starts . </p>
<p>Some other styles I thought about : </p>
<pre><code>if (collResv.repeatability is None or
        collResv.somethingElse):
    collResv.rejected = True
    collResv.rejectCompletely()
</code></pre>
<p>This looks pretty inconsistent as the second lie is indented much more than the first line but it 's readable . </p>
<pre><code>if (collResv.repeatability is None or
  collResv.somethingElse):
    collResv.rejected = True
    collResv.rejectCompletely()
</code></pre>
<p>This is also more readable than the first example , but the indentation is not a multiple of 4 anymore and besides that it looks wrong as the second line has less indentation than the beginning of the condition in the first line . </p>
<hr />
<p>So , my main question is : Is there a suggested indentation style for cases like that which do not require overly-long lines ( i.e. a single-line condition ) ? If not , what do you prefer for cases like that ? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-6 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>Often I work around this problem by calculating the condition in an own statement : </p>
<pre><code>condition = (collResv.repeatability is None or
             collResv.somethingElse)
if condition:
    collResv.rejected = True
    collResv.rejectCompletely()
</code></pre>
<p>Though , for a still relatively short condition as in your specific example I 'd go for nosklo 's solution - the extra statement used here is more suited for even longer conditional expressions . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>This is an indirect answer--not answering the style question directly , but it 's the practical answer in general , so it 's worth mentioning . </p>
<p>I find it extremely rare to need to write multi-line conditionals. There are two factors to this : </p>
<ul>Do n't wrap code at 80 columns. PEP-8 's advice on this subject is ancient and harmful ; we 're well past the days of 80x25 terminals and editors that ca n't sensibly handle wrapping. 100 columns is fine , and 120 is usually acceptable , too . If conditions become so long that they still need to wrap , it 's usually reasonable to move some of the logic out of the conditional and into a separate expression. This also tends to help readability . </ul>
<p>Grepping through my recent projects , around 12kloc , there 's only one conditional long enough that it needed to be wrapped ; the issue simply very rarely arises. If you do need to do this , then as nosklo says , indent it separately--as you noticed , indenting it to the same level as the block beneath it is confusing and hard to read . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>This is what I do : </p>
<pre><code>if (collResv.repeatability is None or
        collResv.somethingElse):
    collResv.rejected = True
    collResv.rejectCompletely()
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>Pep-8 recommends the way you indented your original example . </p>
<p>Now if you 're willing to fly in the face of the oh so sacred of style guides : - ) you could move the operator to the next line : </p>
<pre><code>if (collResv.repeatability is None
    or collResv.somethingElse):
    collResv.rejected = True
    collResv.rejectCompletely()
</code></pre>
<p>I 'm not really a fan of this , I actually find your original syntax fairly easy to read and would n't spend much time monkeying with the indentation or line breaks . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>In such a case , I would simply do : </p>
<pre><code>if (collResv.repeatability is None or
    collResv.somethingElse):
    # do:
    collResv.rejected = True
    collResv.rejectCompletely()
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>An option I sometimes use ( although I 'm not completely sold on its readability ) : </p>
<pre><code>if (collResv.repeatability is None or
    collResv.somethingElse
):
    collResv.rejected = True
    collResv.rejectCompletely()
</code></pre>
<p>Possibly it would be more readable this way : </p>
<pre><code>if (
collResv.repeatability is None or
collResv.somethingElse
):
    collResv.rejected = True
    collResv.rejectCompletely()
</code></pre>
