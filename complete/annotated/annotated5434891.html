<h3>Question ( ID-5434891 ) : </h3><h2>Iterate a list as pair ( current , next ) in Python </h2><p>I sometimes need to iterate a list in python looking at the " current " element and the " next " element. I have , till now , done so with code like : </p>
<pre><code>for current, next in zip(the_list, the_list[1:]):
    # do something
</code></pre>
<p>This works and does what I expect -- just wondering if there 's a more idiomatic or efficient way to do the same thing . </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-6 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>Here 's a relevant example from the <span style="background-color:yellow;">itertools</span> module docs : </p>
<pre><code>def pairwise(iterable):
    "s -> (s0,s1), (s1,s2), (s2, s3), ..."
    a, b = tee(iterable)
    next(b, None)
    return izip(a, b)
</code></pre>
<p>How this works : </p>
<p>First , two parallel iterators , a and b are created ( the tee ( ) call ) , both pointing to the first element of the original <span style="background-color:yellow;">iterable.</span> The second iterator , b is moved 1 step forward ( the next ( b , None ) ) call ) . At this point a points to s0 and b points to s1. Both a and b can traverse the original iterator independently - the <span style="background-color:yellow;">izip</span> function takes the two iterators and makes pairs of the returned elements , advancing both iterators at the same pace . </p>
<p>One caveat : the tee ( ) function produces two iterators that can advance independently of each other , but it comes at a cost. If one of the iterators advances further than the other , then tee ( ) needs to keep the consumed elements in memory until the second iterator comsumes them too ( it can not 'rewind ' the original iterator ) . Here it does n't matter because one iterator is only 1 step ahead of the other , but in general it 's easy to use a lot of memory this way . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>Since the_list [ 1 : ] actually creates a copy of the whole list ( excluding its first element ) , and zip ( ) creates a list of tuples immediately when called , in total three copies of your list are created. If your list is very large , you might prefer </p>
<pre><code>from itertools import izip, islice
for current, next in izip(the_list, islice(the_list, 1, None)):
    # whatever
</code></pre>
<p>which does not copy the list at all . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>This should do the same thing : </p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python
the_list = [1,2,3,4]
for i in range(1, len(the_list)):
    current, next = the_list[i-1], the_list[i]
    print current, next
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>Check MizardX answer for this question . But i do n't think this solution is more idiomatic than yours . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>A basic solution : </p>
<pre><code>def neighbors( list ):
  i = 0
  while i + 1 < len( list ):
    yield ( list[ i ], list[ i + 1 ] )
    i += 1

for ( x, y ) in neighbors( list ):
  print( x, y )
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><pre><code>code = '0016364ee0942aa7cc04a8189ef3'
# Getting the current and next item
print  [code[idx]+code[idx+1] for idx in range(len(code)-1)]
# Getting the pair
print  [code[idx*2]+code[idx*2+1] for idx in range(len(code)/2)]
</code></pre>
