<h3>Question ( ID-3742580 ) : </h3><h2>Python , why elif keyword ? </h2><p>I just started python programming ! There 's one thing I wondered about , the " elif " keyword . </p>
<p>Any other programming languages I used before use simply the " else if " syntax . Does anyone have an idea why the python developers add the additional " elif " keyword ? </p>
<p>Why not : </p>
<pre><code>if a:
    print("a")
else if b:
    print("b")
else:
    print("c")
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-8 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>Far as I know , it 's there to avoid excessive indentation. You could write </p>
<pre><code>if x < 0:
    print 'Negative'
else:
    if x == 0:
        print 'Zero'
    else:
        print 'Positive'
</code></pre>
<p>but </p>
<pre><code>if x < 0:
    print 'Negative'
elif x == 0:
    print 'Zero'
else:
    print 'Positive'
</code></pre>
<p>is just so much nicer . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>To avoid brace ^ H ^ H ^ H ^ H ^ Helse if war . </p>
<p>In C/C + + where you have an else if , you can structure your code in many different styles : </p>
<pre><code>if (...) {
    ...
} else if (...) {
    ...
}


if (...) {
    ...
} 
else if (...) {
    ...
}

if (...) {
    ...
} else 
if (...) {
    ...
}

// and so on

<p>by having an elif instead , such war would never happen since there is only one way to write an elif . Also , elif is much shorter than else if . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>Most likely its syntactic sugar. Like the Wend of Visual Basic . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>That 's just the way it is. Javascript uses else if , php uses elseif , perl uses elsif , the C preprocessor and python use elif . None of them are wrong , they just choose slightly different syntax to do the same thing. : D </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Python inherits this from Perl , where it 's called elsif . </p>
<p>In Python 's case , else if as two separate constructs like it is in C-like languages would be quite ugly as you 'd have to have else : if : with two indenting levels . </p>
<p>It 's arguable whether special-casing the two keywords together would be better ( so making else if a single construct , like the not in operator . </p>
<p>PL/SQL also has elsif , and the C preprocessor has it spelled elif . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>elif is some sort of replacement for switch in other languages but with more power </p>
<p>for example in C you write </p>
<pre>
switch (number){
 case 1:
   doA()
   break;
 case 2:
   doB()
   break;
 case N:
   doN()
   break;
 default:
   doSomethingElse()
   break;
}
</pre>
<p>in Python you write </p>
<pre>
if number == 1: doA()
elif number == 2: doB()
elif number == N: doC()
else: doSomethingElse()
</pre>
<p>As you see elif is more powerful since you can put more complex statements than in a switch , plus avoid nesting if/else statements </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>I find them helpful to help differentiate the " else-if " s from the " final else " . </p>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>else if in python called elif </p>
<pre><code>if a:
    print "a" 
elif b:
    print "b" 
else:
    print "c" 
</code></pre>
