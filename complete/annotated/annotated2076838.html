<h3>Question ( ID-2076838 ) : </h3><h2>Generating non-repeating <span style="background-color:yellow;">random</span> numbers in Python </h2><p>Ok this is one of those trickier than it sounds questions so I 'm turning to stack overflow because I ca n't think of a good answer. Here is what I want : I need Python to generate a simple a list of numbers from 0 to 1,000,000,000 in <span style="background-color:yellow;">random</span> order to be used for serial numbers ( using a <span style="background-color:yellow;">random</span> number so that you ca n't tell how many have been assigned or do timing attacks as easily , i.e. guessing the <span style="background-color:yellow;">next</span> one that will come up ) . These numbers are stored in a database table ( indexed ) along with the information linked to them. The program generating them does n't run forever so it ca n't rely on internal state . </p>
<p>No big deal right ? Just generate a list of numbers , shove them into an array and use Python " <span style="background-color:yellow;">random.shuffle</span> ( big_number_array ) " and we 're done. Problem is I 'd like to avoid having to store a list of numbers ( and thus read the file , pop one off the top , save the file and close it ) . I 'd rather generate them on the fly. Problem is that the solutions I can think of have problems : </p>
<p>1 ) Generate a <span style="background-color:yellow;">random</span> number and then check if it has already been used. If it has been used generate a new number , check , repeat as needed until I find an unused one. Problem here is that I may get unlucky and generate a lot of used numbers before getting one that is unused. Possible fix : use a very large pool of numbers to reduce the chances of this ( but then I end up with silly long numbers ) . </p>
<p>2 ) Generate a <span style="background-color:yellow;">random</span> number and then check if it has already been used. If it has been used add or subtract one from the number and check again , keep repeating until I hit an unused number. Problem is this is no longer a <span style="background-color:yellow;">random</span> number as I have introduced bias ( eventually I will get clumps of numbers and you 'd be able to predict the <span style="background-color:yellow;">next</span> number with a better chance of success ) . </p>
<p>3 ) Generate a <span style="background-color:yellow;">random</span> number and then check if it has already been used. If it has been used add or subtract another <span style="background-color:yellow;">randomly</span> generated <span style="background-color:yellow;">random</span> number and check again , problem is we 're back to simply generating <span style="background-color:yellow;">random</span> numbers and checking as in solution 1 . </p>
<p>4 ) Suck it up and generate the <span style="background-color:yellow;">random</span> list and save it , have a daemon put them into a Queue so there are numbers available ( and avoid constantly opening and closing a file , batching it instead ) . </p>
<p>5 ) Generate much larger <span style="background-color:yellow;">random</span> numbers and hash them ( i.e. using MD5 ) to get a smaller numeric value , we should rarely get collisions , but I end up with larger than needed numbers again . </p>
<p>6 ) Prepend or append time based information to the <span style="background-color:yellow;">random</span> number ( i.e. unix timestamp ) to reduce chances of a collision , again I get larger numbers than I need . </p>
<p>Anyone have any clever ideas that will reduce the chances of a " collision " ( i.e. generating a <span style="background-color:yellow;">random</span> number that is already taken ) but will also allow me to keep the number " small " ( i.e. less than a billion ( or a thousand million for your europeans = ) ) . </p>
<p>Answer and why I accepted it : </p>
<p>So I will simply go with 1 , and hope it 's not an issue , however if it is I will go with the deterministic solution of generating all the numbers and storing them so that there is a guarentee of getting a new <span style="background-color:yellow;">random</span> number , and I can use " small " numbers ( i.e. 9 digits instead of an MD5/etc. ) . </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-13 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>This is a neat problem , and I 've been thinking about it for a while ( with solutions similar to Sjoerd 's ) , but in the end , here 's what I think : </p>
<p>Use your point 1 ) and stop worrying . </p>
<p>Assuming real <span style="background-color:yellow;">randomness</span> , the probability that a <span style="background-color:yellow;">random</span> number has already been chosen before is the count of previously chosen numbers divided by the size of your pool , i.e. the maximal number . </p>
<p>If you say you only need a billion numbers , i.e. nine digits : Treat yourself to 3 more digits , so you have 12-digit serial numbers ( that 's three groups of four digits &ndash ; nice and readable ) . </p>
<p>Even when you 're close to having chosen a billion numbers previously , the probability that your new number is already taken is still only 0,1 % . </p>
<p>Do step 1 and draw again. You can still check for an " infinite " loop , say do n't try more than 1000 times or so , and then fallback to adding 1 ( or something else ) . </p>
<p>You 'll win the lottery before that fallback ever gets used . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>With some modular arithmic and prime numbers , you can create all numbers between 0 and a big prime , out of order. If you choose your numbers carefully , the <span style="background-color:yellow;">next</span> number is hard to guess . </p>
<pre><code>modulo = 87178291199 # prime
incrementor = 17180131327 # relative prime

current = 433494437 # some start value
for i in xrange(1, 100):
    print current
    current = (current + incrementor) % modulo
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>I think you are overestimating the problems with approach 1 ) . Unless you have hard-realtime requirements just checking by <span style="background-color:yellow;">random</span> choice terminates rather fast. The probability of needing more than a number of iterations decays exponentially. With 100M numbers outputted ( 10 % fillfactor ) you 'll have one in billion chance of requiring more than 9 iterations. Even with 50 % of numbers taken you 'll on average need 2 iterations and have one in a billion chance of requiring more than 30 checks. Or even the extreme case where 99 % of the numbers are already taken might still be reasonable - you 'll average a 100 iterations and have 1 in a billion change of requiring <span style="background-color:yellow;">2062</span> iterations </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>My first thought is to use a symmetric encryption algorithm ( e.g. DES or AES ) in counter mode . Your counter just goes from 0 upwards , and the encryption uses a key of your choice to turn it into a seemingly <span style="background-color:yellow;">random</span> value , that is guaranteed to never have collisions ( because cryptographic algorithms create a 1 : 1 mapping ) . One benefit is that this is reversible , so you could take the serial number and decrypt it to get back to the simple counter value . </p>
<p>The one problem I see with this is that the encrypted value is 64 bits ( for DES ) which would give you a <span style="background-color:yellow;">20-digit</span> decimal serial number which is probably impractically large . </p>
<p>Still , since you are n't really after a cryptographic solution , I wonder if you could take this general idea and adapt it for your needs. Interested in making a " 32-bit block encryption algorithm " ? ! </p>
<p>( Actually , you mention timing attacks , so perhaps you do need something cryptographically secure ? ) </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>The standard Linear Congruential <span style="background-color:yellow;">random</span> number generator 's seed sequence CAN NOT repeat until the full set of numbers from the starting seed value have been generated. Then it MUST repeat precisely . </p>
<p>The internal seed is often large ( 48 or 64 bits ) . The generated numbers are smaller ( 32 bits usually ) because the entire set of bits are not <span style="background-color:yellow;">random.</span> If you follow the seed values they will form a distinct non-repeating sequence . </p>
<p>The question is essentially one of locating a good seed that generates " enough " numbers. You can pick a seed , and generate numbers until you get back to the starting seed. That 's the length of the sequence. It may be millions or billions of numbers . </p>
<p>There are some guidelines in Knuth for picking suitable seeds that will generate very long sequences of unique numbers . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>If they do n't have to be <span style="background-color:yellow;">random</span> , but just not obviously linear ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , ... ) , then here 's a simple algorithm : </p>
<p>Pick two prime numbers. One of them will be the largest number you can generate , so it should be around one billion. The other should be fairly large . </p>
<pre><code>max_value = 795028841
step = 360287471
previous_serial = 0
for i in xrange(0, max_value):
    previous_serial += step
    previous_serial %= max_value
    print "Serial: %09i" % previous_serial
</code></pre>
<p>Just store the previous serial each time so you know where you left off. I ca n't prove mathmatically that this works ( been too long since those particular classes ) , but it 's demonstrably correct with smaller primes : </p>
<pre><code>s = set()
with open("test.txt", "w+") as f:
    previous_serial = 0
    for i in xrange(0, 2711):
        previous_serial += 1811
        previous_serial %= 2711
        assert previous_serial not in s
        s.add(previous_serial)
</code></pre>
<p>You could also prove it empirically with 9-digit primes , it 'd just take a bit more work ( or a lot more memory ) . </p>
<p>This does mean that given a few serial numbers , it 'd be possible to figure out what your values are--but with only nine digits , it 's not likely that you 're going for unguessable numbers anyway . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>If you do n't need something cryptographically secure , but just " sufficiently obfuscated " .. . </p>
<p>Galois Fields </p>
<p>You could try operations in Galois Fields , e.g. GF ( 2 ) 32 , to map a simple incrementing counter <span style="background-color:yellow;">x</span> to a seemingly <span style="background-color:yellow;">random</span> serial number y : </p>
<pre><code>x = counter_value
y = some_galois_function(x)
</code></pre>
<ul>Multiply by a constant Inverse is to multiply by the reciprocal of the constant Raise to a power : <span style="background-color:yellow;">x</span> n Reciprocal <span style="background-color:yellow;">x</span> -1 Special case of raising to power n It is its own inverse Exponentiation of a primitive element : a <span style="background-color:yellow;">x</span> Note that this does n't have an easily-calculated inverse ( discrete logarithm ) Ensure a is a primitive element , aka generator </ul>
<p>Many of these operations have an inverse , which means , given your serial number , you can calculate the original counter value from which it was derived . </p>
<p>As for finding a library for Galois Field for Python... good question. If you do n't need speed ( which you would n't for this ) then you could make your own. I have n't tried these : </p>
<ul>NZMATH Finite field Python package Sage , although it 's a whole environment for mathematical computing , much more than just a Python library </ul>
<p>Matrix multiplication in GF ( 2 ) </p>
<p></p>
<p>CRC </p>
<p>A related possibility is to use a CRC calculation. Based on the remainder of long-division with an irreducible polynomial in GF ( 2 ) . Python code is readily available for CRCs ( crcmod , pycrc ) , although you might want to pick a different irreducible polynomial than is normally used , for your purposes. I 'm a little fuzzy on the theory , but I think a 32-bit CRC should generate a unique value for every possible combination of 4-byte inputs. Check this. It 's quite easy to experimentally check this , by feeding the output back into the input , and checking that it produces a complete cycle of length 2 32 -1 ( zero just maps to zero ) . You may need to get rid of any initial/final XORs in the CRC algorithm for this check to work . </p>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>Do you need this to be cryptographically secure or just hard to guess ? How bad are collisions ? Because if it needs to be cryptographically strong and have zero collisions , it is , sadly , impossible . </p>
<br /><b># 8 </b><br /><p>I started trying to write an explanation of the approach used below , but just implementing it was easier and more accurate. This approach has the odd behavior that it gets faster the more numbers you 've generated. But it works , and it does n't require you to generate all the numbers in advance . </p>
<p>As a simple optimization , you could easily make this class use a probabilistic algorithm ( generate a <span style="background-color:yellow;">random</span> number , and if it 's not in the set of used numbers add it to the set and return it ) at first , keep track of the collision rate , and switch over to the deterministic approach used here once the collision rate gets bad . </p>

<br /><b># 9 </b><br /><p>You can run 1 ) without running into the problem of too many wrong <span style="background-color:yellow;">random</span> numbers if you just decrease the <span style="background-color:yellow;">random</span> interval by one each time . </p>
<p>For this method to work , you will need to save the numbers already given ( which you want to do anyway ) and also save the quantity of numbers taken . </p>
<p>It is pretty obvious that, after having collected 10 numbers, your pool of possible random numbers will have been decreased by 10. Therefore, you must not choose a number between 1 and 1.000.000 but between 1 an 999.990. Of course this number is not the real number but only an index (unless the 10 numbers collected have been 999.991, 999.992, …); you’d have to count now from 1 omitting all the numbers already collected.</p>
<p>Of course , your algorithm should be smarter than just counting from 1 to 1.000.000 but I hope you understand the method . </p>
<p>I don’t like drawing random numbers until I get one which fits either. It just feels wrong.</p>
<br /><b># 10 </b><br /><p>If it is enough for you that a casual observer ca n't guess the <span style="background-color:yellow;">next</span> value , you can use things like a linear congruential generator or even a simple linear feedback shift register to generate the values and keep the state in the database in case you need more values. If you use these right , the values wo n't repeat until the end of the universe. You 'll find more ideas in the list of <span style="background-color:yellow;">random</span> number generators . </p>
<p>If you think there might be someone who would have a serious interest to guess the <span style="background-color:yellow;">next</span> values , you can use a database sequence to count the values you generate and encrypt them with an encryption algorithm or another cryptographically strong perfect has function. However you need to take care that the encryption algorithm is n't easily breakable if one can get hold of a sequence of successive numbers you generated - a simple RSA , for instance , wo n't do it because of the Franklin-Reiter Related Message Attack . </p>
<br /><b># 11 </b><br /><p>I 'd rethink the problem itself... You do n't seem to be doing anything sequential with the numbers... and you 've got an index on the column which has them. Do they actually need to be numbers ? </p>
<p>Consider a sha hash... you do n't actually need the entire thing. Do what git or other url shortening services do , and take first 3/4/5 characters of the hash. Given that each character now has 36 possible values instead of 10 , you have 2,176,782,336 combinations instead of 999,999 combinations ( for six digits ) . Combine that with a quick check on whether the combination exists ( a pure index query ) and a seed like a timestamp + <span style="background-color:yellow;">random</span> number and it should do for almost any situation . </p>
<br /><b># 12 </b><br /><p>You are stating that you store the numbers in a database . </p>
<p>Would n't it then be easier to store all the numbers there , and ask the database for a <span style="background-color:yellow;">random</span> unused number ? Most databases support such a request . </p>
