<h3>Question ( ID-1705077 ) : </h3><h2>Python library for Linux process management </h2><p>Through my web interface I would like to start/stop certain processes and determine whether a started process is still running . </p>
<p>My existing website is Python based and running on a Linux server , so do you know of a suitable library that supports this functionality ? </p>
<p>Thanks </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-7 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>To start/stop python sub processes you can use the subprocess module . To check whether they are running you might use <span style="background-color:yellow;">psutil</span> : </p>
<pre><code>>>> import psutil
>>> pid = 1034  # some pid
>>> p = psutil.Process(pid)
>>> p.is_running()
True
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>Checking the list of running processes is accomplished ( even by core utilities like " ps " ) by looking at the contents of the /proc directory . </p>
<p>As such , the library you 're interested for querying running processes is the same as used for working with any other files and directories ( i.e. sys or os , depending on the flavor you 're after. Pay special attention to os.path though , it does most of what you 're after ) . To terminate or otherwise interact with processes , you send them signals , which is accomplished with os.kill . Finally , you start new processes using os.popen and friends . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>Since you said this is a Linux server , calling the external ps binary is usually slower , uses more resources and is more error prone than using the information from /proc directly . </p>
<p>Since nobody else mentioned , one simple way is : </p>
<pre><code>glob.glob('/proc/[0-9]*/')
</code></pre>
<p>Good luck . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>This is what i use. It uses procfs ( so you are limited to Unix like systems , will not work on macs i think ) and the previously mentioned <span style="background-color:yellow;">glob.</span> It also gets the cmdline , which allows you to identify the process. For killing the process you can use os.kill ( signal.SIGTERM , <span style="background-color:yellow;">pid</span> ) . For using subprocess , please check this post http : //stackoverflow.com/questions/337863/python-popen-and-select-waiting-for-a-process-to-terminate-or-a-timeout/1035488 # 1035488 </p>
<pre><code>def list_processes():
    """
    This function will return an iterator with the process pid/cmdline tuple

        f = open("%s/cmdline" % pid_path)
        pid = pid_path.split("/")[2] # get the PID
        # we replace the \x00 to spaces to make a prettier output from kernel
        cmdline = f.read().replace("\x00", " ").rstrip()

<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>The os module is probably your friend. There 's os.kill , for instance to kill a process . </p>
<p>In terms of getting a list of processes , you 'll probably want to shell out to the ps command. This question has more information on that . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>Python subprocess http : //docs.python.org/library/subprocess.html might help you. If you create a process with subprocess , you can use Popen.terminate ( ) function to stop it . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>I 'd use PSutil. To provide a practical example : </p>
<pre><code>import psutil

for proc in psutil.get_process_list():
    if proc.username == 'yourusername':
        if myappname in proc.cmdline:
            print 'App is running'
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively , Red Hat use and maintain a Python module called python-linux-procfs , which natively parses /proc , to manage processes. it 's not very well publicized , but provides some additional Linux-specific features ( eg , scheduling class ) which are sometimes useful . </p>
