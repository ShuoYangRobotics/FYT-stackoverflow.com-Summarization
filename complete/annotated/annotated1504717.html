<h3>Question ( ID-1504717 ) : </h3><h2>Python ' = = ' vs 'is ' comparing strings , 'is ' fails sometimes , why ? </h2><p>I 've got a python program where two variables are set to the value 'public ' . In a conditional expression I have the comparison var1 is var2 which fails , but if I change it to var1 = = var1 it returns True . </p>
<p>now if I open my python interpreter and do the same " is " comparison it succeeds </p>
<pre><code>>>> s1 = 'public'
>>> s2 = 'public'
>>> s2 is s1
True
</code></pre>
<p>What am I missing here ? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-9 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>is is identity testing , = = is equality testing. what happens in your code would be emulated in the interpreter like this : </p>
<pre><code>>>> a = 'pub'
>>> b = ''.join(['p', 'u', 'b'])
>>> a == b
True
>>> a is b
False
</code></pre>
<p>so , no wonder they 're not the same , right ? </p>
<p>In other words : is is the id ( a ) = = id ( b ) </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>SilentGhost and others are correct here. is is used for identity comparison , while = = is used for equality comparison . </p>
<p>The reason this works interactively is that ( most ) string literals are interned by default. From Wikipedia : </p>
<blockquote>Interned strings speed up string comparisons , which are sometimes a performance bottleneck in applications ( such as compilers and dynamic programming language runtimes ) that rely heavily on hash tables with string keys. Without interning , checking that two different strings are equal involves examining every character of both strings. This is slow for several reasons : it is inherently O ( n ) in the length of the strings ; it typically requires reads from several regions of memory , which take time ; and the reads fills up the processor cache , meaning there is less cache available for other needs. With interned strings , a simple object identity test suffices after the original intern operation ; this is typically implemented as a pointer equality test , normally just a single machine instruction with no memory reference at all . </blockquote>
<p>So , when you have two string literals ( words that are literally typed into your program source code , surrounded by quotation marks ) in your program that have the same value , the Python compiler will automatically intern the strings , making them both stored at the same memory location. ( Note that this does n't always happen , and the rules for when this happens are quite convoluted , so please do n't rely on this behavior in production code ! ) </p>
<p>Since in your interactive session both strings are actually stored in the same memory location , they have the same identity , so the is operator works as expected. But if you construct a string by some other method ( even if that string contains exactly the same characters ) , then the string may be equal , but it is not the same string -- that is , it has a different identity , because it is stored in a different place in memory . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>The is keyword is a test for object identity while = = is a value comparison . </p>
<p>If you use is , the result will be true if and only if the object is the same object. However , = = will be true any time the values of the object are the same . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>One last thing to note , you may use the intern function to ensure that you 're getting a reference to the same string : </p>
<pre><code>>>> a = intern('a')
>>> a2 = intern('a')
>>> a is a2
True
</code></pre>
<p>As pointed out above , you should probably not be doing is to determine equality on strings. But this may be helpful to know if you have some kind of weird requirement to use is . </p>
<p>Note that the intern function got moved from being a built in function to being in the module sys for Python 3 . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>I think it has to do with the fact that , when the 'is ' comparison evaluates to false , two distinct objects are used. If it evaluates to true , that means internally it 's using the same exact object and not creating a new one , possibly because you created them within a fraction of 2 or so seconds and because there is n't a large time gap in between it 's optimized and uses the same object . </p>
<p>This is why you should be using the equality operator = = , not is , to compare the value of a string object . </p>
<pre><code>>>> s = 'one'
>>> s2 = 'two'
>>> s is s2
False
>>> s2 = s2.replace('two', 'one')
>>> s2
'one'
>>> s2 is s
False
>>>
</code></pre>
<p>In this example , I made s2 , which was a different string object previously equal to 'one ' but it is not the same object as s , because the interpreter did not use the same object as I did not initially assign it to 'one ' , if I had it would have made them the same object . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>I believe that this is known as " interned " strings. Python does this , so does Java , and so do C and C + + when compiling in optimized modes . </p>
<p>If you use two identical strings , instead of wasting memory by creating two string objects , all interned strings with the same contents point to the same memory . </p>
<p>This results in the Python " is " operator returning True because two strings with the same contents are pointing at the same string object. This will also happen in Java and in C . </p>
<p>This is only useful for memory savings though. You can not rely on it to test for string equality , because the various interpreters and compilers and JIT engines can not always do it . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>From my limited experience with python , is is used to compare two objects to see if they are the same object as opposed to two different objects with the same value. = = is used to determine if the values are identical . </p>
<p>Here is a good example : </p>
<pre><code>>>> s1 = u'public'
>>> s2 = 'public'
>>> s1 is s2
False
>>> s1 == s2
True
</code></pre>
<p>s1 is a unicode string , and s2 is a normal string. They are not the same type , but are the same value . </p>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>This is a side note , but in idiomatic python , you will often see things like : </p>
<pre><code>if x is None: 
    # some clauses
</code></pre>
<p>This is safe , because there is guaranteed to be one instance of the Null Object ( i.e. , None ) . </p>
<br /><b># 8 </b><br /><p>If you 're not sure what you 're doing , use the ' = = ' . If you have a little more knowledge about it you can use 'is ' for known objects like 'None' . </p>
<p>Otherwise you 'll end up wondering why things does n't work and why this happens : </p>
<pre><code>>>> a = 1
>>> b = 1
>>> b is a
True
>>> a = 6000
>>> b = 6000
>>> b is a
False
</code></pre>
<p>I 'm not even sure if some things are guaranteed to stay the same between different python versions/implementations . </p>
