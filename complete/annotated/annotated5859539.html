<h3>Question ( ID-5859539 ) : </h3><h2>for statement in python </h2><p>I 'm confused about " <span style="background-color:yellow;">x</span> " in the python code below . </p>
<pre><code>>>> # Grocery list
... grocery_list = ['apples', 'bananas', 'oranges', 'milk']
>>> for x in grocery_list:
...     print(x, len(x))
</code></pre>
<p>I am confused about <span style="background-color:yellow;">x</span> 's role in the for statement above. Is " <span style="background-color:yellow;">x</span> " a variable that is being defined within the for statement , or is it something else ? It just seems different than how I am used to defining a variable , but I noticed " <span style="background-color:yellow;">x</span> " can be anything , which makes me think it is , in fact , a user-defined variable . </p>
<p>Please help . </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-7 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>Yes it 's defined within the for statement. It 's just a placeholder for an element in the list and can be called anything , e.g . </p>
<pre><code>grocery_list = ['apples', 'bananas', 'oranges', 'milk']
for grocery in grocery_list:
  print(grocery, len(grocery))
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>Python is a late-binding dynamic language. While Python programmers and the Python documentation frequently use the terms " variable " and " assignment " the more precise terms are " name " and " binding. " </p>
<p>In your example <span style="background-color:yellow;">x</span> is a name of an object. At each iteration over the loop it 's bound to the next object from your list. Python lists , and most other Python containers as well as many other Python object classes , feature iteration functions. That is to say that they define functions following a protocol which allows them to be used in for loops . </p>
<p>As you 've noted a Python name ( analogous to a " variable " in other languages ) can be bound to any object of any type. A list can contain any mixture of object references. Thus , when you iterate over a list your " variable " ( or loop name ( s ) ) can be bound to objects of different types , potentially different types on each pass through the loop . </p>
<p>You can also have multiple names bound through " tuple unpacking " at each step through the iteration. For example the following snippet of code is a commonly used way to deal with dictionaries : </p>
<pre><code>for key, value in some_dictionary.items():
   # do something with each key and its associated value
</code></pre>
<p>This form is n't specific to dictionaries. The .items ( ) method of dictionaries returns a sequence of two item tuples and this form of for loop could be used with any list or sequence which returned two-item tuples ( or even two-time lists ) . Similarly you could see tuple unpacking used on sequence consisting of items which contain a uniform number of items : </p>
<pre><code>for category, item, quantity, price in some_invoice_query():
    # do something with these items, etc.
</code></pre>
<p>Conceptually a " variable " in most programming languages is a placeholder for data of a certain type ( as well as a name by which that placeholder is referred throughout a program 's source code ) . However , in Python ( and other late-binding dynamic languages ) a name is a reference to an object and conveys no constraint regarding the type or class of object to which the reference is made . </p>
<p>You can , rather crudely , think of Python names as if they were all void pointers in C . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p><span style="background-color:yellow;">x</span> is a name in your current namespace , and the objects in grocery_list are assigned to this name one after another . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>The variable will be assigned behind the scenes each of the values of the list , in order. If the list holds references , then the reference will be assigned to the loop variable , of course . </p>
<p>It 's almost equivalent to : </p>
<pre><code>for i in xrange(len(grocery_list)):
  x = grocery_list[i]
  # rest of code here
</code></pre>
<p>But much much cleaner and ( potentially ) faster. The name ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">x</span> ) is not signicifant , it can be whatever you please . </p>
<p>After the loop has executed , the variable remains in scope , with the value of the last iteration that ran. So if you use a break to get out of the loop , that will show : </p>
<pre><code>>>> for i in xrange(100):
...   if i == 10: break
...
>>> i
10
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>I think it is okay for you to treat <span style="background-color:yellow;">x</span> as a variable that is being defined within the for statement. Anything else is okay too. Python does not require a seperated " define " process , any variable is " defined " the first time it has been given a value . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>In your example , <span style="background-color:yellow;">x</span> is the user-defined variable to which each value in grocery_list will be assigned in turn . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p><span style="background-color:yellow;">x</span> is a temporary variable that steps through a sequence. In lists , <span style="background-color:yellow;">x</span> will step through each item in the list . </p>
<pre><code>>>> grocery_list = ['apples', 'bananas', 'oranges', 'milk']
>>> for x in grocery_list:
...     print(x, len(x))
...
apples 6
bananas 7
oranges 7
milk 4
>>> print(x)
milk
</code></pre>
<p>EDIT : Apparently <span style="background-color:yellow;">x</span> remains defined even after the for loop exits . </p>
<p>A few more examples should clear things up : </p>
<pre><code>>>> for x in 'some string': # x is bound to each character in the string
...     print(x)
...
s
o
m
e

s
t
r
i
n
g
>>> for x in (0, 1, 2, 3): # x is bound to each number in the tuple
...     print(x)
...
0
1
2
3
>>> for x in [(0,0), (1,1), (2,2)]: # x is bound to each tuple in the list
...     print(x)
... 
(0, 0)
(1, 1)
(2, 2)
</code></pre>
