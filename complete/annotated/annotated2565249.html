<h3>Question ( ID-2565249 ) : </h3><h2>Apply function to one element of a list in Python </h2><p>I 'm looking for a concise and functional style way to apply a function to one element of a tuple and return the new tuple , in Python . </p>
<p>For example , for the following input : </p>
<pre><code>inp = ("hello", "my", "friend")
</code></pre>
<p>I would like to be able to get the following output : </p>
<pre><code>out = ("hello", "MY", "friend")
</code></pre>
<p>I came up with two solutions which I 'm not satisfied with . </p>
<p>One uses a higher-order function . </p>
<pre><code>def apply_at(arr, func, i):
    return arr[0:i] + [func(arr[i])] + arr[i+1:]

apply_at(inp, lambda x: x.upper(), 1)
</code></pre>
<p>One uses list comprehensions ( this one assumes the length of the tuple is known ) . </p>
<pre><code>[(a,b.upper(),c) for a,b,c in [inp]][0]
</code></pre>
<p>Is there a better way ? Thanks ! </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-6 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>Here is a version that works on any iterable and returns a generator : </p>
<pre><code>>>> inp = ("hello", "my", "friend")
>>> def apply_nth(fn, n, iterable):
...    return (fn(x) if i==n else x for (i,x) in enumerate(iterable))
... 
>>> tuple(apply_nth(str.upper, 1, inp))
('hello', 'MY', 'friend')
</code></pre>
<p>You can extend this so that instead of one position you can give it a list of positions : </p>
<pre><code>>>> def apply_at(fn, pos_lst, iterable):
...    pos_lst = set(pos_lst)
...    return (fn(x) if i in pos_lst else x for (i,x) in enumerate(iterable))
... 
>>> ''.join(apply_at(str.upper, [2,4,6,8], "abcdefghijklmno"))
'abCdEfGhIjklmno'

<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><pre><code>>>> inp = "hello", "my", "friend"
>>> index = 1
>>> inp[:index] + ( str.upper(inp[index]),) + inp[index + 1:]
('hello', 'MY', 'friend')
</code></pre>
<p>Seems simple , the only thing you may need to know is that to make a single element tuple , do ( elt , ) </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>Maybe some ' like this ? </p>
<pre><code>>>>inp = ("hello", "my", "friend")
>>>out =  tuple([i == 1 and x.upper() or x for (x,i) in zip(t,range(len(t)))])

>>> out
('hello', 'MY', 'friend')
</code></pre>
<p>Note : rather than ( x,i ) in zip ( t , range ( len ( t ) ) ) I should have thought of using the enumerate function : ( i,x ) in enumerate ( t ) </p>
<p>Making it a bit more general : Rather than hard-coding the 1 , we can place it in a variable . Also , by using a tuple for that purpose , we can apply the function to elements at multiple indexes . </p>
<pre><code>>>>inp = ("hello", "my", "friend")
>>>ix  = (0,2)
>>>out =  tuple([i in ix and x.upper() or x for (i, x) in enumerate(t)])

>>> out
('HELLO', 'my', 'FRIEND')
</code></pre>
<p>Also , we can " replace " the zip ( ) /enumerate ( ) by <span style="background-color:yellow;">map</span> ( ) , in something like </p>
<pre><code>out = tuple(map(lambda x,i : i == 1 and x.upper() or x, inp, range(len(inp)) ) )
</code></pre>
<hr />
<p>Edit : ( addressing comment about specifying the function to apply ) : Could be something as simple as : </p>
<pre><code>>>> f = str.upper  # or whatever function taking a single argument
>>> out = tuple(map(lambda x,i : i == 1 and f(x) or x, inp, range(len(inp)) ) )
</code></pre>
<p>Since we 're talking about applying any function , we should mention the small caveat with the condition and if_true or if_false construct which is not exactly a substitute for the if/else ternary operator found in other languages. The limitation is that the function can not return a value which is equivalent to False ( None , 0 , 0.0 , ' ' for example ) . A suggestion to avoid this problem , is , with Python 2.5 and up , to use the true if-else ternary operator , as shown in Dave Kirby 's answer ( note the when_true if condition else when_false syntax of this operator ) </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>I commented in support of your first snippet , but here are a couple other ways for the record : </p>
<pre><code>(lambda (a,b,c): [a,b.upper(),c])(inp)
</code></pre>
<p>( Wo n't work in Python 3.x. ) And : </p>
<pre><code>[inp[0], inp[1].upper(), inp[1]]
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>I do n't understand if you want to apply a certain function to every element in the tuple that passes some test , or if you would like it to apply the function to any element present at a certain index of the tuple. So I have coded both algorithms : </p>
<p>This is the algorithm ( coded in Python ) that I would use to solve this problem in a functional language like scheme : </p>
<p>This function will identify the element identifiable by id and apply func to it and return a list with that element changed to the output of func . It will do this for every element identifiable as id : </p>
<pre><code>def doSomethingTo(tup, id):
    return tuple(doSomethingToHelper(list(tup), id))

def doSomethingToHelper(L, id):
    if len(L) == 0:
        return L
    elif L[0] == id:
        return [func(L[0])] + doSomethingToHelper(L[1:], id)
    else:
        return [L[0]] + doSomethingToHelper(L[1:], id)
</code></pre>
<p>This algorithm will find the element at the index of the tuple and apply func to it , and stick it back into its original index in the tuple </p>
<pre><code>def doSomethingAt(tup, i): 
    return tuple(doSomethingAtHelper(list(tup), i, 0))

def doSomethingAtHelper(L, index, i):
if len(L) == 0: 
        return L
elif i == index: 
        return [func(L[0])] + L[1:]
else: 
        return [L[0]] + doSomethingAtHelper(L[1:], index, i+1)
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>i also like the answer that Dave Kirby gave. however , as a public service announcement , i 'd like to say that this is not a typical use case for tuples -- these are data structures that originated in Python as a means to move data ( parameters , arguments ) to and from functions... they were not meant for the programmer to use as general array-like data structures in applications -- this is why lists exist. naturally , if you 're needing the read-only/immutable feature of tuples , that is a fair argument , but given the OP question , this should 've been done with lists instead -- note how there is extra code to either pull the tuple apart and put the resulting one together and/or the need to temporarily convert to a list and back . </p>
