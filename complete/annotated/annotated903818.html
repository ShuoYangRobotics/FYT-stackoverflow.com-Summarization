<h3>Question ( ID-903818 ) : </h3><h2>How to tell when a <span style="background-color:yellow;">function</span> in another class has been <span style="background-color:yellow;">called</span> </h2><p>I have two Python classes , <span style="background-color:yellow;">call</span> them " <span style="background-color:yellow;">C1</span> " and " C2 " . Inside <span style="background-color:yellow;">C1</span> is a <span style="background-color:yellow;">function</span> named " F1 " and inside C2 is a <span style="background-color:yellow;">function</span> named " F2 " . Is there a way to execute F2 each time F1 is run without making a direct <span style="background-color:yellow;">call</span> to F2 from within F1 ? Is there some other mechanism by which to know when a <span style="background-color:yellow;">function</span> from inside another class has been <span style="background-color:yellow;">called</span> ? </p>
<p>I welcome any suggestions , but would like to know of some way to achieve this without making an instance of C2 inside <span style="background-color:yellow;">C1</span> . </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-6 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>You can write a little <span style="background-color:yellow;">helper</span> decorator that will make the <span style="background-color:yellow;">call</span> for you. The advantage is that it 's easy to tell who is going to <span style="background-color:yellow;">call</span> what by looking at the code. And you can add as many <span style="background-color:yellow;">function</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">calls</span> as you want. It works like registering a <span style="background-color:yellow;">callback</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">function</span> : </p>
<pre><code>from functools import wraps

def oncall(call):
    def helper(fun):
        @wraps(fun)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            result = fun(*args, **kwargs)
            call()
            return result
        return wrapper
    return helper

class c1:
   @classmethod
   def f1(cls):
      print 'f1'

class c2:
   @classmethod
   @oncall(c1.f1)
   def f2(cls):
      print 'f2'

>>> c2.f2()
f2
f1
>>> c1.f1()
f1

<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>I believe that what you are trying to do would fit into the realm of Aspect Oriented Programming . However I have never used this methodology and do n't even know if it can/has been implemented in Python . </p>
<p>Edit I just took a look at the link I provided and saw that there are 8 Python implementations mentioned. So the hard work has already been done for you : - ) </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>You can do aspect-oriented programming with <span style="background-color:yellow;">function</span> and method decorators since Python 2.2 : </p>
<pre><code>@decorator(decorator_args)
def functionToBeDecorated(function_args) :
    pass
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>It really depends on why you do n't want to <span style="background-color:yellow;">call</span> F2 directly from within F1. You could always create a third class ( C3 ) which encapsulates both <span style="background-color:yellow;">C1</span> and C2. When F3 is <span style="background-color:yellow;">called</span> , it will <span style="background-color:yellow;">call</span> both F1 and F2. This is known as the Mediator pattern - http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediator_pattern </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Not knowing what is you are trying to achieve , i would suggest taking a look at pydispatcher . It allows you to implement the Observer pattern </p>
<p>Basically , you register F2 with the dispatcher so that it will be <span style="background-color:yellow;">called</span> when a specific 'signal ' is emitted. Your F1 'emits a signal ' that says " I 've been <span style="background-color:yellow;">called</span> " . The dispatcher then <span style="background-color:yellow;">calls</span> F2 ( or any number of <span style="background-color:yellow;">functions</span> that have registered themselves with that particular signal ) . Its actually really simpler than it sounds , easy to use , and de-couples your code ( F1 does not need to know about F2 ) . </p>
<p>( arhh.. I 'm a new user and not allowed to include hyperlinks , but pydispatcher is easy to google for ) </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>You catch all accesses to F1 with <span style="background-color:yellow;">__getattr__</span> . This will allow you to do extra processing or return your own <span style="background-color:yellow;">function</span> in place of F1 </p>
<pre><code>class C1:
  def __getattr__(self,name):
    if name == 'F1': C2.F2()
    return self[name]
</code></pre>
<p>I should warn you that this will <span style="background-color:yellow;">call</span> C2.F2 even if F1 is only being accessed ( not run ) . It 's rare but not impossible that F1 might simply be accessed for another purpose like f = myC1.F1 . To run F2 only on a <span style="background-color:yellow;">call</span> of F1 you need to expand this example to combine F2 with the returned <span style="background-color:yellow;">function</span> object. in other words : </p>
<pre><code>def F1F2():
   self.F1()
   C2.F2()
return F1F2
</code></pre>
