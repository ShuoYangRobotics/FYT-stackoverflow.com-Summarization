<h3>Question ( ID-1806143 ) : </h3><h2>Calculate percent at runtime </h2><p>I have this problem where I have to " audit " a percent of my transtactions . </p>
<p>If percent is <span style="background-color:yellow;">100</span> I have to audit them all , if is 0 I have to skip them all and if 50 % I have to review the half etc . </p>
<p>The problem ( or the opportunity ) is that I have to perform the check at runtime . </p>
<p>What I tried was : </p>
<pre><code>audit = 100/percent
</code></pre>
<p>So if percent is 50 </p>
<pre><code>audit = 100 / 50 ( which is 2 )
</code></pre>
<p>So I have to audit <span style="background-color:yellow;">1</span> and skip <span style="background-color:yellow;">1</span> audit <span style="background-color:yellow;">1</span> and skip <span style="background-color:yellow;">1</span> . . </p>
<p>If is 30 </p>
<p>audit = <span style="background-color:yellow;">100</span> / 30 ( 3.3 ) </p>
<p>I audit 2 and skip the third . </p>
<p>Question </p>
<p>I 'm having problems with numbers beyond 50 % ( like 75 % ) because it gives me <span style="background-color:yellow;">1.333</span> , .. . </p>
<p>When would be the correct algorithm to know how many to audit as they go ? ... I also have problems with 0 ( due to division by 0 : P ) but I have fixed that already , and with <span style="background-color:yellow;">100</span> etc . </p>
<p>Any suggestion is greatly appreciated . </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-8 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>Why not do it <span style="background-color:yellow;">randomly.</span> For each transaction , pick a <span style="background-color:yellow;">random</span> number between 0 and <span style="background-color:yellow;">100.</span> If that number is less than your " percent " , then audit the transaction. If the number is greater than your " percent " , then do n't. I do n't know if this satisfies your requirements , but over an extended period of time , you will have the right percentage audited . </p>
<p>If you need an exact " skip 2 , audit one , skip 2 audit one " type of algorithm , you 'll likely have luck adapting a line-drawing algorithm . </p>
<br /><b># <span style="background-color:yellow;">1</span> </b><br /><p>Try this : </p>
<p><span style="background-color:yellow;">1</span> ) Keep your audit percentage as a decimal . 2 ) For every transaction , associate a <span style="background-color:yellow;">random</span> number ( between 0 and <span style="background-color:yellow;">1</span> ) with it 3 ) If the <span style="background-color:yellow;">random</span> number is less than the percentage , audit the transaction . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><pre><code>    if percent > random.randint(1,100):
        print("audit")
    else:
        print("skip")
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>To follow your own algorithm : just keep adding that <span style="background-color:yellow;">1.333333</span> ( or other quotient ) to a counter . </p>
<p>Have two counters : an integer one and a real one. If the truncated part of the real counter = the integer counter , the audit is carried out , otherwise it is n't , like this : </p>
<pre><code>Integer counter   Real counter

1                 1.333333: audit transaction
2                 2.666666: audit transaction
3                 3.999999: audit transaction
4                 truncated(5.333333) = 5 > 4 => do NOT audit transaction
5                 5.333333: audit transaction
</code></pre>
<p>Only increment the real counter when its truncated version = the integer counter. Always increment the integer counter . </p>
<p>In code : </p>
<pre><code>var p, pc: double;
    c: integer;
begin
  p := 100 / Percentage;
  pc := p;
  for c := 1 to NrOfTransactions do begin
    if trunc(pc) = c then begin
      pc := pc + p;
      Do audit on transaction c
    end  
  end;
end;
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>If you need to audit these transactions in real time ( as they are received ) perhaps you could use a <span style="background-color:yellow;">random</span> number generator to check if you need to audit the transaction . </p>
<p>So if for example you want to audit 50 % of transactions , for every transaction received you would generate a <span style="background-color:yellow;">random</span> number between 0 and <span style="background-color:yellow;">1</span> , and if the number was greater than 0.5 , audit that transaction . </p>
<p>While for low numbers this would not work , for large numbers of transactions this would give you very close to the required percentage . </p>
<p>This is better than your initial suggestion because if does not allow a method to 'game ' the audit process - if you are auditing every second transaction this allows bad transactions to slip through . </p>
<p>Another possibility is to keep a running total of the total transactions and as this changes the total number of transactions that need to be audited ( according to your percentage ) you can pipe transactions into the auditing process. This however still opens the slight possibility of someone detecting the pattern and circumventing the audit . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>For a high throughput system the <span style="background-color:yellow;">random</span> method is best , but if you do n't want <span style="background-color:yellow;">randomness</span> , the this algorithm will do the job. Do n't forget to test it in a unit test ! </p>
<pre><code>// setup
int transactionCount = 0;
int auditCount = 0;
double targetAuditRatio = auditPercent/100.0;

// start of processing
transactionCount++;
double actualAuditRatio = auditCount/transactionCount;

if (actualAuditRatio < targetAuditRatio) {
    auditCount++;
    // do audit
}
// do processing
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>You can constantly " query " each audit using counter. For example </p>
<pre><code>ctr = 0;
percent = 50
while(1) {
   ctr += percent;
   if (ctr >= 100) {
      audit;
      ctr = ctr - 100;
   } else
      skip
}
</code></pre>
<p>You can use floats ( however this will bring some unpredictability ) or multiply <span style="background-color:yellow;">100</span> percent by sth to get better resolution . </p>
<p>There is really no need to use <span style="background-color:yellow;">random</span> number generator . </p>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>Not tested , but in the <span style="background-color:yellow;">random</span> module there is a function sample . If transactions was a list of transactions , you would do something like : </p>
<pre><code>import random

to_be_audited = random.sample(transactions,len(transactions*100/percentage))
</code></pre>
<p>This would generate a list to_be_audited which would be a <span style="background-color:yellow;">random</span> , non-duplicating sample of the transactions . </p>
