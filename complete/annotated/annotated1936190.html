<h3>Question ( ID-1936190 ) : </h3><h2>Is it true that I ca n't use curly braces in Python ? </h2><p>I was reading that Python does all it 's " code blocks " by indentation , rather than with curly braces. Is that right ? So functions , if 's and stuff like that all appear without surrounding their block with curly braces ? </p>

    print "it's true"
#}
else: #{
    print "it's false!"
#}
</code></pre>
<p>( Obviously , this is a joke. ) </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>You can try to add support for braces using a future import statement , but it 's not yet supported , so you 'll get a syntax error : </p>
<pre><code>>>> from __future__ import braces
  File "<stdin>", line 1
SyntaxError: not a chance
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>Yes. Curly braces are not used. Instead , you use the : symbol to introduce new blocks , like so : </p>
<pre><code>if True:
    DoSomething()
    SomethingElse()
else:
    Something()
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>Yup. However , you define dictionaries in Python using curly braces : </p>
<pre><code>dict = {
    'key': 'value',
}
</code></pre>
<p>Ahhhhhh . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Yes . </p>
<pre><code>if True:
    #dosomething
else:
    #dosomething else

#continue on with whatever you were doing
</code></pre>
<p>Basically , wherever you would 've had an opening curly brace , use a colon instead. Unindent to close the region. It does n't take long for it to feel completely natural . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>Yup : ) </p>
<p>And there 's ( usually ) a difference between 4 spaces and a tab , so make sure you standardize the usage . . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>As others have mentioned , you are correct , no curly braces in Python. Also , you do not have no end or endif or endfor or anything like that ( as in pascal or ruby ) . All code blocks are indentation based . </p>
