<h3>Question ( ID-2503444 ) : </h3><h2>What is your strategy to avoid dynamic typing errors in Python ( NoneType has no attribute x ) ? </h2><p>Python is one of my <span style="background-color:yellow;">favorite</span> languages , but I really have a love/hate relationship with it 's dynamicness. Apart <span style="background-color:yellow;">from</span> the advantages , it often results in me <span style="background-color:yellow;">forgetting</span> to check a type , trying to call an attribute and getting the NoneType ( or any other ) has no attribute x error. A lot of them are pretty harmless but if not handled correctly they can bring down your entire app/process/etc. Over time I got better predicting where these could pop up and adding explicit type checking , but because I 'm only human I miss one occasionally and then some end-user <span style="background-color:yellow;">finds</span> it . </p>
<p>So I 'm interested in your strategy to avoid these. Do you use type-checking decorators ? Maybe special <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> wrappers ? Please share.. . </p>

<p>This does n't make much sense. You so rarely need to " check " a type. You simply run unit tests and if you 've provided the wrong type <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> , things <span style="background-color:yellow;">fail.</span> You never need to " check " much , in my experience . </p>
<blockquote>trying to call an attribute and getting the NoneType ( or any other ) has no attribute x error . </blockquote>
<p>Unexpected None is a plain-old bug. 80 % of the time , I omitted the return . Unit tests always reveal these . </p>
<p>Of those that remain , 80 % of the time , they 're plain old bugs due to an " early exit " which returns None because someone wrote an incomplete return statement. These if <span style="background-color:yellow;">foo</span> : return structures are easy to detect with unit tests. In some cases , they should have been if <span style="background-color:yellow;">foo</span> : return somethingMeaningful , and in still other cases , they should have been if <span style="background-color:yellow;">foo</span> : raise Exception ( " Foo " ) . </p>
<p>The rest are dumb mistakes misreading the API 's. Generally , mutator <span style="background-color:yellow;">functions</span> do n't return anything. Sometimes I <span style="background-color:yellow;">forget.</span> Unit tests <span style="background-color:yellow;">find</span> these quickly , since basically , nothing works right . </p>
<p>That covers the " unexpected None " cases pretty solidly. Easy to unit test <span style="background-color:yellow;">for.</span> Most of the mistakes involve <span style="background-color:yellow;">fairly</span> trivial-to-write tests <span style="background-color:yellow;">for</span> some pretty obvious species of mistakes : wrong return ; <span style="background-color:yellow;">failure</span> to raise an exception . </p>
<p>Other " has no attribute X " errors are really wild mistakes where a totally wrong type was used. That 's either really wrong assignment statements or really wrong <span style="background-color:yellow;">function</span> ( or method ) calls. They always <span style="background-color:yellow;">fail</span> elaborately during unit testing , requiring very little effort to <span style="background-color:yellow;">fix</span> . </p>
<blockquote>A lot of them are pretty harmless but if not handled correctly they can bring down your entire app/process/etc . </blockquote>
<p>Um... Harmless ? If it 's a bug , I pray that it brings down my entire app as quickly as possible so I can <span style="background-color:yellow;">find</span> it. A bug that does n't crash my app is the most horrible situation imaginable. " Harmless " is n't a word I 'd use <span style="background-color:yellow;">for</span> a bug that <span style="background-color:yellow;">fails</span> to crash my app . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>If you write good unit tests <span style="background-color:yellow;">for</span> all of your code , you should <span style="background-color:yellow;">find</span> the errors very quickly when testing code . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>You can also use decorators to enforce the type of attributes . </p>
<pre><code>>>> @accepts(int, int, int)
... @returns(float)
... def average(x, y, z):
...     return (x + y + z) / 2
...
>>> average(5.5, 10, 15.0)
TypeWarning:  'average' method accepts (int, int, int), but was given
(float, int, float)
15.25
>>> average(5, 10, 15)
TypeWarning:  'average' method returns (float), but result is (int)
15
</code></pre>
<p>I 'm not really a <span style="background-color:yellow;">fan</span> of them , but I can see their usefulness . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>One advantage of TDD is that you end up writing code that is easier to write tests <span style="background-color:yellow;">for</span> . </p>
<p>Writing code <span style="background-color:yellow;">first</span> and then the tests can result in code that superficially works the same , but is much harder to write 100 % coverage tests <span style="background-color:yellow;">for</span> . </p>
<p>Each case is likely to be different </p>
<p>It might make sense to have a decorator to check whether a particular parameter is None ( or some other unexpected value ) if you use it in a bunch of places . </p>
<p>Maybe it is appropriate to use the <span style="background-color:yellow;">Null</span> pattern - if the code is blowing up because you are setting the initial value to None , you could instead set the initial value to a null version of the <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> . </p>
<p>More and more wrappers can add up to quite a performance hit though , so it 's always better to write code <span style="background-color:yellow;">from</span> the start that avoids the corner cases </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>One tool to try to help you keep your pieces <span style="background-color:yellow;">fitting</span> together well is interfaces . zope.interface is the most notable package in the Python world <span style="background-color:yellow;">for</span> using interfaces. Check out http : //wiki.zope.org/zope3/WhatAreInterfaces and http : //glyph.twistedmatrix.com/2009/02/explaining-why-interfaces-are-great.html to start to get an idea how interfaces and z.i in particular work. Interfaces can prove very useful in a large Python codebases . </p>
<p>Interfaces are no substitute <span style="background-color:yellow;">for</span> testing. Reasonably comprehensive testing is especially important in highly dynamic languages like Python where there are types of bugs that could not exist in a statically types language. Tests will also help you catch the sorts of bugs that are not unique to dynamic languages. Fortunately , developing in Python means that testing is easy ( due to the <span style="background-color:yellow;">flexibility</span> ) and you have plenty of time to write them that you saved because you 're using Python . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><blockquote><span style="background-color:yellow;">forgetting</span> to check a type </blockquote>
<p>With duck typing , it should n't be necessary to check a type. But that 's theory , in reality you will often want to validate input parameters ( e.g. checking a UUID with a regex ) . For that purpose , I created myself some handy decorators <span style="background-color:yellow;">for</span> simple type and return type checking which are called like this : </p>
<pre><code>@decorators.params(0, int, 2, str) # first parameter must be integer / third a string
@decorators.returnsOrNone(int, long) # must return an int/long value or None
def doSomething(integerParam, noMatterWhatParam, stringParam):
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>For everything else I mostly use assertions. Of course one often <span style="background-color:yellow;">forgets</span> to check a parameter , so it 's necessary to test and to test often . </p>
<blockquote>trying to call an attribute </blockquote>
<p>Happens to me very seldom. Actually I often use methods instead of direct access to attributes ( the " good " old getter/setter approach sometimes ) . </p>
<blockquote>because I 'm only human I miss one occasionally and then some end-user <span style="background-color:yellow;">finds</span> it </blockquote>
<p>" Software is always completed at the customers'. " - An anti-pattern which you should solve with unit tests that handle all possible cases in a <span style="background-color:yellow;">function.</span> Easier said than done , but it helps.. . </p>
<p>As <span style="background-color:yellow;">for</span> other common Python mistakes ( mistyped names , wrong imports , ... ) , I 'm using Eclipse with PyDev <span style="background-color:yellow;">for</span> projects ( not <span style="background-color:yellow;">for</span> small scripts ) . PyDev warns you about most of the simple kinds of mistakes . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p></p>
<p></p>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>I tend to use </p>
<pre><code>if x is None:
    raise ValueError('x cannot be None')
</code></pre>
<p>But this will only work with the actual None value . </p>
<p>A more general approach is to test <span style="background-color:yellow;">for</span> the necessary attributes before you try to use them. For example : </p>
<pre><code>def write_data(f):
    # Here we expect f is a file-like object.  But what if it's not?
    if not hasattr(f, 'write'):
        raise ValueError('write_data requires a file-like object')
    # Now we can do stuff with f that assumes it is a file-like object
</code></pre>
<p>The point of this code is that instead of getting an error message like " NoneType has no attribute write " , you get " <span style="background-color:yellow;">write_data</span> requires a <span style="background-color:yellow;">file-like</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> " . The actual bug is n't in <span style="background-color:yellow;">write_data</span> ( ) , and is n't really a problem with NoneType at all. The actual bug is in the code that calls <span style="background-color:yellow;">write_data</span> ( ) . The key is to communicate that information as directly as possible . </p>
<br /><b># 8 </b><br /><p>Something you can use to simplify your code is using the <span style="background-color:yellow;">Null</span> Object Design Pattern ( to which I was introduced in Python Cookbook ) . </p>
<blockquote>Roughly , the goal with <span style="background-color:yellow;">Null</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> is to provide an 'intelligent ' replacement <span style="background-color:yellow;">for</span> the often used primitive data type None in Python or <span style="background-color:yellow;">Null</span> ( or <span style="background-color:yellow;">Null</span> pointers ) in other languages. These are used <span style="background-color:yellow;">for</span> many purposes including the important case where one member of some group of otherwise similar elements is special <span style="background-color:yellow;">for</span> whatever reason. Most often this results in conditional statements to distinguish between ordinary elements and the primitive <span style="background-color:yellow;">Null</span> value . </blockquote>
<p>This <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> just eats the lack of attribute error , and you can avoid checking <span style="background-color:yellow;">for</span> their existence . </p>
<p>It 's nothing more than </p>
<pre><code>class Null(object):

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        "Ignore parameters."
        return None

    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        "Ignore method calls."
        return self

    def __getattr__(self, mname):
        "Ignore attribute requests."
        return self

    def __setattr__(self, name, value):
        "Ignore attribute setting."
        return self

    def __delattr__(self, name):
        "Ignore deleting attributes."
        return self

    def __repr__(self):
        "Return a string representation."
        return "<Null>"

    def __str__(self):
        "Convert to a string and return it."
        return "Null"
</code></pre>
<p>With this , if you do <span style="background-color:yellow;">Null</span> ( " any " , " params " , " you " , " want " ) .attribute_that_doesnt_exists ( ) it wo n't explode , but just silently become the equivalent of pass . </p>
<p>Normally you 'd do something like </p>
<pre><code>if obj.attr:
    obj.attr()
</code></pre>
<p>With this , you just do : </p>
<pre><code>obj.attr()
</code></pre>
<p>and <span style="background-color:yellow;">forget</span> about it. Beware that extensive use of the <span style="background-color:yellow;">Null</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> can potentially hide bugs in your code . </p>
