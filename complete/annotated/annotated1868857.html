<h3>Question ( ID-1868857 ) : </h3><h2>Convert and merge strings into a list in Python </h2><p>In Python I have four strings that include the formatting of a list : </p>
<pre><code>line1 ="['a.b.c','b.c.a','c.d.e']"
line2 ="['def','efg']"
line3 ="['f']"
line4 ="['g']"
</code></pre>
<p>How do I merge them all so I get a valid Python list such as : </p>
<pre><code>SumLine = ['a.b.c','b.c.a','c.d.e','def','efg','f','g']
</code></pre>

<p>Do n't use the built-in eval unless you have preternatural trust in the strings you 're evaluating ; <span style="background-color:yellow;">ast.literal_eval</span> , while limited to simple constants , is totally safe and therefore , most often , way preferable . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>Try eval : </p>
<pre><code>>>> line1 ="['a.b.c','b.c.a','c.d.e']"
>>> line2 ="['def','efg']"
>>> line3 ="['f']"
>>> line4 ="['g']"
>>> eval(line1) + eval(line2) + eval(line3) + eval(line4)
['a.b.c', 'b.c.a', 'c.d.e', 'def', 'efg', 'f', 'g']
</code></pre>
<p>But be careful , because eval can be dangerous. Do n't use it on input that you receive from the user and have n't validated . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>The quick and dirty way is to use eval : </p>
<pre><code>SumLine = eval(line1) + eval(line2) + eval(line3) + eval(line4)
</code></pre>
<p>But dont do this if you are getting these strings from someone else ( ie user input ) </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>The simple way is to concetenate the strings to an expression that can be evaulated to give the required result : </p>
<pre><code>line1 ="['a.b.c','b.c.a','c.d.e']"
line2 ="['def','efg']"
line3 ="['f']"
line4 ="['g']"
lines = [line1, line2, line3, line4]

print eval('+'.join(lines))
</code></pre>
<p>However this is unsafe if you ca n't trust your input , so if you 're using Python 2.6 or higher you should use the safe eval function <span style="background-color:yellow;">ast.literal_eval</span> in the <span style="background-color:yellow;">ast</span> module , although this does n't work with the ' + ' trick so you will have to iterate over each element instead . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Where did you get these strings ? Anything short of a real parser will be fragile. Below is what I would recommed , if I had not seen Alex Martelli 's brilliant answer before ! </p>
<p>You may parse them as JSON arrays , but JSON wants to read double-quoted strings , not single quotes. This introduces fragility to the method , but still much preferable to eval ( ) which is unsafe . </p>
<pre><code>import json
line1 ="['a.b.c','b.c.a','c.d.e']"
json.loads(line1.replace("'", '"'))
</code></pre>
<p>The result is a parsed list like [ u'a.b.c ' , u'b.c.a ' , u'c.d.e ' ] , you may than go on to join the parsed lists . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>you need to eval them first and then you could sum the results. But I wonder how do you get this strings in the first place ? </p>
