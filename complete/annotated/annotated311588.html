<h3>Question ( ID-311588 ) : </h3><h2>How to indent Python list-comprehensions ? </h2><p>List comprehensions can be useful in certain situations , but they can also be rather horrible to read.. As a slightly exaggerated example , how would you indent the following ? </p>
<pre><code>allUuids = [x.id for x in self.db.query(schema.allPostsUuid).execute(timeout = 20) if x.type == "post" and x.deleted is not False]
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-6 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>It depends on how long they are. I tend to structure them like so : </p>
<pre><code>[x.id for x
 in self.db.query(schema.allPostsUuid).execute(timeout=20)
 if x.type == 'post' 
    and x.deleted is not False
    and ...
    and ...]
</code></pre>
<p>That way every expression has its own line . </p>
<p>If any line becomes too big I like to extract it out in a lambda or expression : </p>
<pre><code>transform = lambda x: x.id
results = self.db.query(schema.allPostsUuid).execute(timeout=20)
condition = lambda x: x.deleted is not False and ... and ...
[transform(x) for x in results if condition(x)]
</code></pre>
<p>And then if a lambda becomes too long it gets promoted to a function . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>Where I work , our coding guidelines would have us do something like this : </p>
<pre><code>all_posts_uuid_query = self.db.query(schema.allPostsUuid)
all_posts_uuid_list = all_posts_uuid_query.execute(timeout=20)
all_uuid_list = [
    x.id 
    for x in all_posts_uuid_list 
    if (
        x.type == "post" 
        and 
        not x.deleted  # <-- if you don't care about NULLs / None
    )
]
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>For me that 's too much. Maybe it 's just a terrible example , since " type " and " deleted " would clearly be part of the db query . </p>
<p>I tend to think that if a list comprehension spans multiple lines it probably should n't be a list comprehension. Having said that , I usually just split the thing at " if " like other people have and will answer here . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>How about : </p>
<pre><code>allUuids = [x.id for x in self.db.query(schema.allPostsUuid).execute(timeout = 20) 
                   if (x.type == "post" and x.deleted is not False)]
</code></pre>
<p>Generally , long lines can be avoided by pre-computing subexpressions into variables , which might add a minuscule performance cost : </p>
<pre><code>query_ids = self.db.query(schema.allPostsUuid).execute(timeout = 20)
allUuids = [x.id for x in query_ids
                   if (x.type == "post" and x.deleted is not False)]
</code></pre>
<p>By the way , is n't ' is not False ' kind-of superfluous ? Are you worried about differentiating between None and False ? Because otherwise , it suffices to leave the condition as only : i f ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">x.type</span> = = " post " and <span style="background-color:yellow;">x.deleted</span> ) </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>You should not use a list comprehension for that . </p>
<p>List comprehensions are an awesome feature , but they are meant to be shortcuts , not regular code . </p>
<p>For such a long snippet , you should use ordinary blocs : </p>
<pre><code>allUuids = []
for x in self.db.query(schema.allPostsUuid).execute(timeout = 20) :
    if x.type == "post" and x.deleted is not False :
        allUuids.append(x.id)
</code></pre>
<p>Exactly the same behavior , much more readable. Guido would be proud of you : - ) </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><pre><code>allUuids = [x.id 
            for x in self.db.query(schema.allPostsUuid).execute(timeout = 20) 
            if x.type == "post" and x.deleted is not False]
</code></pre>
