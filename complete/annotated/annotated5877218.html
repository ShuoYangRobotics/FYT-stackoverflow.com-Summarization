<h3>Question ( ID-5877218 ) : </h3><h2>Python * imports </h2><p>I 've generally been told that the following is bad practice . </p>
<pre><code>from module import *
</code></pre>
<p>The main reasoning ( or so I 've been told ) , is that you could possibly import something you did n't want , and it could shadow a similarly named function or class from another <span style="background-color:yellow;">module</span> . </p>
<p>However , what about PyQt </p>
<pre><code>from PyQt4.QtCore import *
</code></pre>
<p>Every example I 've ever seen is written this way , mainly because everything exported from Qt starts with " Q " , so it 's not going to shadow anything . </p>
<p>What 's the concensus ? Is it always bad to use * imports ? </p>
<p>EDIT : </p>
<p>Just to be clear , this question is specifically in regards to using <span style="background-color:yellow;">PyQt4.</span> It has nothing to do with the way I am designing some other project . </p>
<p>Basically , I 've found that coding to PEP8 has improved my code readability , except with regards to importing <span style="background-color:yellow;">PyQt4</span> , and so I 've disregarded the frowns from purists until now. But now my dev group is deciding on one convention and I 'm wondering if this is a scenario " where practicality beats purity " , or if I should just suck it up and deal with monstrous <span style="background-color:yellow;">PyQt4</span> imports </p>
<pre><code>from PyQt4.QtGui import QComboBox, QLineEdit, QLayout, Q;lakdfaf.......
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-8 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>This can sort of turn into a religious war. It 's a matter of whether you want to be explicit or whether you want to avoid being too verbose. In general , following the Zen of Python , it 's better to be explicit , but sometimes people just do n't find it practical to list every import from particular <span style="background-color:yellow;">module</span> . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>My general rule is that if I did n't <span style="background-color:yellow;">write</span> the <span style="background-color:yellow;">module</span> , I do n't import it all. My biggest fear is actually over writing local variables that might have been defined in the imported <span style="background-color:yellow;">module.</span> So to keep from having to type in long <span style="background-color:yellow;">module</span> names , I use the import as feature. Using your <span style="background-color:yellow;">module</span> as an example I would do the following : </p>
<pre><code>import PyQt4.QtCore as qt
</code></pre>
<p>That being said , I have many support <span style="background-color:yellow;">modules</span> that I <span style="background-color:yellow;">write</span> that I will import everything. Like the pyqt <span style="background-color:yellow;">module</span> , I name them with a descriptive name that helps show which <span style="background-color:yellow;">module</span> it came from . </p>
<p>Edit per comment When I use import * , my support <span style="background-color:yellow;">modules</span> do not contain classes or anything that can create a new instance. They tend to be groups of functions that modify existing instances only. To help clarify my opinion : If I am the owner of the source code and I will be the primary maintainer , I will use the import * otherwise I would use the import as . </p>
<p>Another reason that I use the import as feature is to allow me to mock <span style="background-color:yellow;">modules</span> for debugging purposes. In a project that I am working on now , I use pyVisa to talk to a number of GPIB devices. When I 'm not connected to the devices GPIB network , I can use a <span style="background-color:yellow;">dummy_visa</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">module</span> to <span style="background-color:yellow;">write</span> to the stdout ( to verify I am sending the correct format ) and return a random number ( to test my application ) . See below </p>
<pre><code>if visa_debug:
    import dummy_visa as visa
else:
    import visa
gpib = visa.Instrument("GPIB0::10")
gpib.write("MEAS:VOLT?")
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>Making an explicit exception for <span style="background-color:yellow;">modules</span> that already include a namespace in their naming convention ( such as the Q * of PyQT ) is perfectly reasonably. However , I recommend being clear that the default is still " do n't use it " and simply list this exception in your coding guidelines . </p>
<p>import * is also acceptable when it is used as a namespace manipulation trick within an application ( the two forms of that I am familiar with are optional C acceleration <span style="background-color:yellow;">modules</span> that are imported at the end of the pure Python version , and " flattening " a package namespace in __init__ ) . The key point is that the importing <span style="background-color:yellow;">module</span> and the <span style="background-color:yellow;">module</span> being imported are under the control of the same set of developers , and hence avoiding namespace clashes is completely within their control . </p>
<p>The final exception is for convenience at the interactive prompt . </p>
<p>In other situations , it is best to either import specific names or reference them indirectly through the <span style="background-color:yellow;">module</span> name ( or , if there are some commonly reference items , do both : </p>
<p>import <span style="background-color:yellow;">module</span> # Can access anything from <span style="background-color:yellow;">module</span> import a , b , c # But we reference these a lot , so retrieve them directly </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>I find import * gets abused , and can become a maintenance headache , so I avoid it for this and the other reasons you state. That said I feel it 's okay for short interactive sessions , e.g. from pylab import * . </p>
<p>In production code , for packages like <span style="background-color:yellow;">PyQt4.QtCore</span> where you plan to use many of the symbols , I 'd use one of the following syntaxes which make it explicit which namespace the symbols come from : </p>
<pre><code>from PyQt4 import QtCore
# explicit where the symbol came from
QtCore.QTime()

import PyQt4.QtCore as QT
# less desirable since you need to look in the header to find out what QT is
# but I still prefer it to import *
QT.QTime()
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>In general , if you 're going to use from X import Y , it 's a good idea to be explicit about what you 're importing. That 's not just because it 's safer , but also because it makes your code more readable ( and upgrades to the third-party <span style="background-color:yellow;">modules</span> you 're using wo n't have as much potential to incidentally break your code ) . </p>
<p>In some code examples demonstrating big packages , like Qt or matplotlib , the examples will use from <span style="background-color:yellow;">module</span> import * because they 're often only importing from one <span style="background-color:yellow;">module</span> , and it saves typing and lets their example code get to the point. There 's no reason you ca n't do it in your code , but at least use it in moderation , especially if it 's in big source files or other people will be looking at your code . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>Tutorial , chapter 6 : </p>
<blockquote>Note that in general the practice of importing * from a <span style="background-color:yellow;">module</span> or package is frowned upon , since it often causes poorly readable code. However , it is okay to use it to save typing in interactive sessions . </blockquote>
<p>Tutorial , chapter 10 : </p>
<blockquote>Be sure to use the import os style instead of from os import * . This will keep os.open ( ) from shadowing the built-in open ( ) function which operates much differently . </blockquote>
<p>So it seems that it is definitely a bad idea sometimes ; not-the-best idea most of the time ; and an acceptable shortcut in cases where you 'd want to type less , eg in interactive sessions . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>The PyQt design is water under the bridge. I 'm not sure it 's the best thing , but it 's probably influenced by the way Qt was designed. AFAIK , Qt did n't use C + + namespaces historically ( I 'm not sure if it uses them now ) , and therefore had to use prefixes. But all of those design decisions probably happened more than 10 years ago , and that should n't affect your design decisions now . </p>
<p>I know that if I was designing a library now , I would definitely choose to use package namespaces ( which you would import explicitly in Python ) over prefixes. Let 's say my prefix is Pfx - if the library user does n't care writing PfxFunc ( ) every time he needs a function , he certainly would n't care about the extra character in Pfx.Func ( ) , especially when he can use import with specific symbol names to shorten that even more . </p>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>Consider this case </p>
<pre><code>from foo import *
from bar import *

x=baz()
</code></pre>
<p>Now suppose <span style="background-color:yellow;">foo</span> has a function called baz ( ) that we are using in our code and everything is working fine. Months or years pass , the author of <span style="background-color:yellow;">bar</span> adds a function called baz ( ) . Someone updates the egg ang bingo - we have a potentially hard to detect bug in the program . </p>
<p>Not to mention that just looking at those three lines of code , I ca n't tell where baz comes from without going and looking at <span style="background-color:yellow;">foo</span> and <span style="background-color:yellow;">bar</span> </p>
<p>The only time I 'd use import * would be in the interpreter to save some typing </p>
