<h3>Question ( ID-1929274 ) : </h3><h2>In Python , use " <span style="background-color:yellow;">dict</span> " with keywords or anonymous <span style="background-color:yellow;">dictionaries</span> ? </h2><p>Say you want to pass a <span style="background-color:yellow;">dictionary</span> of values to a function , or otherwise want to work with a short-lived <span style="background-color:yellow;">dictionary</span> that wo n't be reused. There are two easy ways to do this : </p>
<p>Use the <span style="background-color:yellow;">dict</span> ( ) function to create a <span style="background-color:yellow;">dictionary</span> : </p>
<pre><code>foo.update(dict(bar=42, baz='qux'))
</code></pre>
<p>Use an anonymous <span style="background-color:yellow;">dictionary</span> : </p>
<pre><code>foo.update({'bar': 42, 'baz': 'qux'})
</code></pre>
<p>Which do you prefer ? Are there reasons other than personal style for choosing one over the other ? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-9 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>I prefer the anonymous <span style="background-color:yellow;">dict</span> option . </p>
<p>I do n't like the <span style="background-color:yellow;">dict</span> ( ) option for the same reason I do n't like : </p>
<pre><code> i = int("1")
</code></pre>
<p>With the <span style="background-color:yellow;">dict</span> ( ) option you 're needlessly calling a function which is adding overhead you do n't need : </p>
<pre><code>>>> from timeit import Timer
>>> Timer("mydict = {'a' : 1, 'b' : 2, 'c' : 'three'}").timeit()
0.91826782454194589
>>> Timer("mydict = dict(a=1, b=2, c='three')").timeit()
1.9494664824719337
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>I think in this specific case I 'd probably prefer this : </p>
<pre><code>foo.update(bar=42, baz='qux')
</code></pre>
<p>In the more general case , I often prefer the literal syntax ( what you call an anonymous <span style="background-color:yellow;">dictionary</span> , though it 's just as anonymous to use { } as it is to use <span style="background-color:yellow;">dict</span> ( ) ) . I think that speaks more clearly to the maintenance programmer ( often me ) , partly because it stands out so nicely with syntax-highlighting text editors. It also ensures that when I have to add a key which is not representable as a Python name , like something with spaces , then I do n't have to go and rewrite the whole line . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>I prefer your " anonymous <span style="background-color:yellow;">dictionary</span> " method and I think this is purely a personal style thing. I just find the latter version more readable but it 's also what I 'm used to seeing . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>The <span style="background-color:yellow;">dict</span> ( ) method has the added overhead of a function call . </p>

<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>My answer will largely talk about the design of APIs to use <span style="background-color:yellow;">dicts</span> vs. keyword args . But it 's also applicable the individual use of { ... } vs. <span style="background-color:yellow;">dict</span> ( ... ) . </p>
<p>The bottom line : be consistent. If most of your code will refer to 'bar ' as a string - keep it a string in { ... } ; if you normally refer to it the identifier bar - use <span style="background-color:yellow;">dict</span> ( bar = ... ) . </p>
<h2>Constraints </h2>
<p>Before talking about style , note that the keyword bar = <span style="background-color:yellow;">42</span> syntax works only for strings and only if they are valid identifiers. If you need arbitrary punctuation , spaces , unicode - or even non-string keys - the question is over = &gt ; only the { 'bar ' : <span style="background-color:yellow;">42</span> } syntax will work . </p>
<p>This also means that when designing an API , you must allow full <span style="background-color:yellow;">dicts</span> , and not only keyword arguments - unless you are sure that only strings , and only valid identifiers are allowed . ( Technically , <span style="background-color:yellow;">update</span> ( * * { 'spaces &amp ; punctuation ' : <span style="background-color:yellow;">42</span> } ) works. But it 's ugly. And numbers/tuples/unicode wo n't work. ) </p>
<p>Note that <span style="background-color:yellow;">dict</span> ( ) and <span style="background-color:yellow;">dict.update</span> ( ) combine both APIs : you can pass a single <span style="background-color:yellow;">dict</span> , you can pass keyword args , and you can even pass both ( the later I think is undocumented ) . So if you want to be nice , allow both : </p>
<pre><code>def update(self, *args, **kwargs):
    """Callable as dict() - with either a mapping or keyword args:

    .update(mapping)
    .update(**kwargs)
    """
    mapping = dict(*args, **kwargs)
    # do something with `mapping`...
</code></pre>
<p>This is especially recommended for a method named .update ( ) , to follow the least-surprise rule . </p>
<h2>Style </h2>
<p>I find it nice to <span style="background-color:yellow;">distinguish</span> internal from external strings. By internal I mean arbitrary identifiers denoting something only inside the program ( variable names , <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> attributes ) or possibly between several programs ( DB columns , XML attribute names ) . They are normally only visible to developers. External strings are intended for human consumption . </p>
<p>[ Some Python coders ( me included ) observe the convention of using 'single_quotes ' for internal strings vs. " Double quotes " for external strings. This is definitely not universal , though. ] </p>
<p>Your question is about the proper uses of barewords ( Perl term ) - syntax sugars allowing to omit the quotes quotes altogether on internal strings. Some languages ( notably LISP ) allow them widely ; the Pythonic opportunities to employ barewords are attribute access - <span style="background-color:yellow;">foo.bar</span> and keyword arguments - <span style="background-color:yellow;">update</span> ( bar = ... ) . </p>
<p>The stylistic dilemma here is " Are your strings internal enough to look like identifiers ? " </p>
<p>If the keys are external strings , the answer is definitely NO : </p>
<pre><code>foo.update({"The answer to the big question": 42})

# which you later might access as:
foo["The answer to the big question"]
</code></pre>
<p>If the keys refer to Python identifiers ( e.g. <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> attributes ) , then I 'd say YES : </p>
<pre><code>foo.update(dict(bar=42))
# As others mentioned, in that case the cleaner API (if possible)
# would be to receive them as **kwargs directly:
foo.update(bar=42)

# which you later might access as:
foo.bar
</code></pre>
<p>If the keys refer to identifiers outside your Python program , such as XML attr names , or DB column names , using barewords may be good or bad choice - but you it 's best to choose one style and be consistent . </p>
<p>Consistency is good because there is a psychological barrier between identifiers and strings. It exists because strings rarely cross it - only when using introspection to do meta-programming. And syntax highlighting only reinforces it. So if you read the code and see a green 'bar ' in one place and a black <span style="background-color:yellow;">foo.bar</span> in a second place , you wo n't immediately make a connection . </p>
<p>Another important rule of thumb is : Barewords are good iff they are ( mostly ) fixed . E.g. if you refer to fixed DB columns mostly in your code , than using barewords to refer to them might be nice ; but if half the time the column is a parameter , then it 's better to use strings . </p>
<p>This is because parameter/constant is the most important difference people associate with the identifiers/strings barrier. The difference between column ( variable ) and " person " ( constant ) is the most readable way to convey this difference. Making them both identifiers would blur the <span style="background-color:yellow;">distinction</span> , as well as backfiring syntactically - you 'd need to use * * { column : value } and getattr ( obj , column ) etc. a lot . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>I prefer the anonymous <span style="background-color:yellow;">dictionary</span> , too , just out of personal style . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>If I have a lot of arguments , sometimes it is nice to omit the quotes on the keys : </p>
<pre><code>DoSomething(dict(
   Name = 'Joe',
   Age = 20,
   Gender = 'Male',
   ))
</code></pre>
<p>This is a very subjective question , BTW. : ) </p>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>I think the <span style="background-color:yellow;">dict</span> ( ) function is really there for when you 're creating a <span style="background-color:yellow;">dict</span> from something else , maybe something that easily produces the necessary keyword args. The anonymous method is best for 'dict literals ' in the same way you 'd use " " for strings , not str ( ) . </p>
<br /><b># 8 </b><br /><p>Actually , if the receiving function will only receive a <span style="background-color:yellow;">dictionary</span> with not pre-dertermined keywords , I normally use the * * passing convention . </p>
<p>In this example , that would be : </p>
<pre><code>class Foo(object):
   def update(self, **param_dict):
       for key in param_dict:
          ....
foo = Foo()
....
foo.update(bar=42, baz='qux')
</code></pre>
