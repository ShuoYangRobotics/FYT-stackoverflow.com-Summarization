<h3>Question ( ID-612372 ) : </h3><h2>Can you give a Django app a verbose name for use throughout the admin ? </h2><p>In the same way that you can give fields and models verbose names that appear in the Django admin , can you give an app a custom name ? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-9 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>You can give your application a custom name by defining app_label in your model definition. But as django builds the admin page it will hash models by their app_label , so if you want them to appear in one application , you have to define this name in all models of your application . </p>
<pre><code>class MyModel(models.Model):
        pass
    class Meta:
        app_label = 'My APP name'
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>No , but you can copy admin template and define app name there . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>Give them a verbose_name property . </p>
<p>Do n't get your hopes up. You will also need to copy the <span style="background-color:yellow;">index</span> view from django.contrib.admin.sites into your own <span style="background-color:yellow;">ProjectAdminSite</span> view and include it in your own custom admin instance : </p>
<pre><code>class ProjectAdminSite(AdminSite):
    def index(self, request, extra_context=None):
        copied stuff here...

admin.site = ProjectAdminSite()
</code></pre>
<p>then tweak the copied view so that it uses your verbose_name property as the label for the app . </p>
<p>I did it by adding something a bit like this to the copied view : </p>
<pre><code>        try:
            app_name = model_admin.verbose_name
        except AttributeError:
            app_name = app_label
</code></pre>
<p>While you are tweaking the <span style="background-color:yellow;">index</span> view why not add an 'order ' property too . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>Well I started an app called todo and have now decided I want it to be named Tasks . The problem is that I already have data within my table so my work around was as follows. Placed into the models.py : </p>
<pre><code>    class Meta:
       app_label = 'Tasks'
       db_table = 'mytodo_todo'
</code></pre>
<p>Hope it helps . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>If you have more than one model in the app just create a model with the <span style="background-color:yellow;">Meta</span> information and create subclasses of that class for all your models . </p>
<pre><code>class MyAppModel(models.Model):
    class Meta:
        app_label = 'My App Label'

class Category(MyAppModel):
     name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>I 'm using django-admin-tools for that . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>For Django 1.4 ( not yet released , but trunk is pretty stable ) , you can use the following method. It relies on the fact that <span style="background-color:yellow;">AdminSite</span> now returns a TemplateResponse , which you can alter before it is rendered . </p>
<p>Here , we do a small bit of monkey patching to insert our behaviour , which can be avoided if you use a custom <span style="background-color:yellow;">AdminSite</span> subclass . </p>
<pre><code>from functools import wraps
def rename_app_list(func):
    m = {'Sites': 'Web sites',
         'Your_app_label': 'Nicer app label',
    }

    @wraps(func)
    def _wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        response = func(*args, **kwargs)
        app_list = response.context_data.get('app_list')

        if app_list is not None:
            for a in app_list:
                name = a['name']
                a['name'] = m.get(name, name)
        title = response.context_data.get('title')
        if title is not None:
            app_label = title.split(' ')[0]
            if app_label in m:
                response.context_data['title'] = "%s administration" % m[app_label]
        return response
    return _wrapper

admin.site.__class__.index = rename_app_list(admin.site.__class__.index)
admin.site.__class__.app_index = rename_app_list(admin.site.__class__.app_index)
</code></pre>
<p>This fixes the <span style="background-color:yellow;">index</span> and the app_index views. It does n't fix the bread crumbs in all other admin views . </p>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>It would be nice to be able to set the applications verbose_name in either it 's init .py or admin.py file. So the init .py file in your applications directory could look like : </p>
<pre><code>class Meta:
    verbose_name = 'My Django App'
</code></pre>
<p>Django 1.2 maybe ? </p>
<br /><b># 8 </b><br /><p>You ca n't give apps a custom name ( at the moment at least ; I believe this is going to be addressed at some point ) , but you can give your fields a " display name " by passing the verbose_name keyword argument to your fields ( this is also conveniently the first positonal argument ) . </p>
<p>So , you can do either : </p>
<pre><code>address = models.CharField(blank=False, max_length=250, verbose_name='Address (Line 1)')
</code></pre>
<p>or </p>
<pre><code>address = models.CharField('Address (Line 1)', blank=False, max_length=250)
</code></pre>
<p></p>
<p>I 'm not sure if you 're saying you know this already or not , but if not , you can give your models custom names too , also with the verbose_name ( and verbose_name_plural ) properties in the model 's <span style="background-color:yellow;">Meta</span> class , like : </p>
<pre><code>class ModelName(models.Model):
    # your model definition here

    class Meta:
        verbose_name = 'verbose model name'
        verbose_name_plural = 'plural verbose model name'
</code></pre>
