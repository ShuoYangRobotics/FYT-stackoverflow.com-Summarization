<h3>Question ( ID-4349056 ) : </h3><h2>Open file and <span style="background-color:yellow;">read</span> to find first instance of number. Python </h2><p>Im stuck on a problem for an assignment , I need to write a program that opens a file on my <span style="background-color:yellow;">computer</span> , and scans that file for the first instance of a number. Once it is found it will <span style="background-color:yellow;">return</span> </p>
<p>The first number in , filenm is x </p>
<p>otherwise it will say there is no number in filenm . </p>
<p>My <span style="background-color:yellow;">code</span> so far is below : When i run it no matter what it always says theres no number : ( </p>
<pre><code>filenm = raw_input("Enter a file name: ")
datain=open(filenm,"r")

try:
    c=datain.read(1)
    result = []

    for line in datain:
        c=datain.read(1)

        while int(c) >= 0:
            c = datain.read(1)
            result.append(c)


except:
    pass

    if len(result) > 0:
            print "The first number is",(" ".join(result))+" . "
    else:
            print "There is no number in" , filenm + "."

<br /><b># <span style="background-color:yellow;">1</span> </b><br /><ol>open the file ; <span style="background-color:yellow;">read</span> it in a loop <span style="background-color:yellow;">char-by-char</span> ; <span style="background-color:yellow;">check</span> if the <span style="background-color:yellow;">char</span> is digit , print whatever you want ; it means there are no numbers in the file , if end-of-file is <span style="background-color:yellow;">reached</span> , print " no numbers " </ol>
<p>Use &lt ; <span style="background-color:yellow;">string&gt</span> ; .isdigit ( ) method to <span style="background-color:yellow;">check</span> if the given <span style="background-color:yellow;">string</span> ( a single <span style="background-color:yellow;">character</span> in your <span style="background-color:yellow;">case</span> ) is a digit . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>I had the wrong idea , sorry . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>I do n't <span style="background-color:yellow;">recommend</span> mixing iterating through a file </p>
<pre><code>for line in datain:
</code></pre>
<p>with using the <span style="background-color:yellow;">read</span> method ( or any similar one ) </p>
<pre><code>c=datain.read(1)
</code></pre>
<p>Just stick with one or the other. Personally , I would go with iterating here . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p><span style="background-color:yellow;">readlines</span> ( ) method <span style="background-color:yellow;">returns</span> a list of all the lines in the file.

<pre><code>filenm = raw_input("Enter a file name: ")
datain=open(filenm,"r")

try:

    result = []

    for line in datain.readlines():
        print 'line: ' + line
        for each in line:
            try:

                int(each)
                # if it worked it add it to the result list

<p>This will only work with the first number <span style="background-color:yellow;">character</span> it finds , not sure if you actually need to extract multi digit numbers . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>My thoughts : </p>
<p><span style="background-color:yellow;">1</span> ) As others noted , do n't mask the exception. It would be better to let it be thrown - at least that way you find out what went wrong , if something went wrong . </p>
<p>2 ) You do want to <span style="background-color:yellow;">read</span> the file a line at a time , using for line in file : . The <span style="background-color:yellow;">reason</span> for this is that the numbers you want to <span style="background-color:yellow;">read</span> are basically " words " ( things separated by spaces ) , and there is n't a built-in way to <span style="background-color:yellow;">read</span> the file a word at a time. file.read ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">1</span> ) <span style="background-color:yellow;">reads</span> a single byte ( i.e. <span style="background-color:yellow;">character</span> , for an ASCII file ) , and then you have to put them together into words yourself , which is tedious. It 's much easier to tell Python to split a line into words. At least , I 'm assuming here that you 're not supposed to pick out the " 20 " from " spam ham20eggs <span style="background-color:yellow;">10</span> lobster thermidor " . </p>
<p>.readlines ( ) is somewhat <span style="background-color:yellow;">redundant</span> ; it 's a <span style="background-color:yellow;">convenience</span> for making a list of the lines in the file - but we do n't need that list ; we just need the lines one at a time. There is a function defined <span style="background-color:yellow;">called</span> .xreadlines ( ) which does that , but it 's deprecated - because we <span style="background-color:yellow;">can</span> just use for line in file : . Seriously - just keep it simple . </p>
<p>3 ) int in Python will not <span style="background-color:yellow;">return</span> a negative value if the input is non-numeric. It will throw an exception. Your <span style="background-color:yellow;">code</span> does not handle that exception properly , because it would break out of the loop. There is no way to tell Python " keep going from where you threw the exception " - and there should n't be , because how is the <span style="background-color:yellow;">rest</span> of the <span style="background-color:yellow;">code</span> supposed to account for what happened ? </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>Actually your <span style="background-color:yellow;">code</span> is n't too far off. There are a number of problems. One big one is that the try/except hides errors from you which might have help you figure things out yourself. Another was that you 're <span style="background-color:yellow;">reading</span> the file with a mixture of a line at a time ( and ignoring its <span style="background-color:yellow;">contents</span> entirely ) as well as a <span style="background-color:yellow;">character</span> at a time . </p>
<p>There also seems to be a misunderstand on your part about what the int ( ) function does when given a non-numeric <span style="background-color:yellow;">character</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">string</span> , what it does is raise an exception rather than <span style="background-color:yellow;">returning</span> something less than 0. While you <span style="background-color:yellow;">could</span> enclose a <span style="background-color:yellow;">call</span> to it it in a try/except with the except being specifically for ValueError , in this <span style="background-color:yellow;">case</span> however it would be easier to just <span style="background-color:yellow;">check</span> ahead of time to see if the <span style="background-color:yellow;">character</span> is a digit since all you want to do is <span style="background-color:yellow;">continue</span> doing that until one that is n't is seen . </p>
<p>So here 's one way your <span style="background-color:yellow;">code</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">could</span> be <span style="background-color:yellow;">revised</span> that would address the above issues : </p>
<pre><code>import string

filenm = raw_input("Enter a file name: ")
datain = open(filenm,"r")

# find first sequence of one or more digits in file
result = []
while True:
    c = datain.read(1)

    while c in string.digits:  # digit?
        result.append(c)
        c = datain.read(1)

    if c == "" or len(result) > 0:  # end-of-file or a number has been found
        break  # get out of loop

if len(result) > 0:
    print "The first number is'", "".join(result) + "'."
else:
    print "There is no number in'", filenm + "'."

close(datain)
