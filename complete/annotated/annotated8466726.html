<h3>Question ( ID-8466726 ) : </h3><h2>Django circular model reference </h2><p>I 'm starting to work on a small soccer league management website ( mostly for learning purposes ) and ca n't wrap my mind around a Django models relationship. For simplicity , let 's say I have 2 types of objects - <span style="background-color:yellow;">Player</span> and <span style="background-color:yellow;">Team.</span> Naturally , a player belongs to one team so that 's a ForeignKey ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">Team</span> ) in the <span style="background-color:yellow;">Player</span> model . So I go : </p>
<pre><code>class Team(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField()
class Player(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField()
    team = models.ForeignKey(Team)
</code></pre>
<p>Then I want each team to have a <span style="background-color:yellow;">captain</span> which would be one of the players so that would be a ForeignKey ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">Player</span> ) in the <span style="background-color:yellow;">Team</span> model. But that would create a circular dependency . Granted my Django experience is limited , but it seems like a simple problem , though I ca n't figure out what I 'm doing wrong conceptually . </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-6 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>as you can see in the docs , for exactly this reason it is possible to specify the foreign model as a string . </p>
<pre><code>team = models.ForeignKey('Team')
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>You could use the full application label in the foreign key to the model not yet defined , and use related_name to avoid name conflict : </p>
<pre><code>class Team(models.Model):
    captain = models.ForeignKey('myapp.Player', related_name="team_captain")

class Player(models.Model):
    team = models.ForeignKey(Team)
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>Here is another way to tackle this problem . Instead of creating a circular dependency , I created an additional table that stores the relationship between players and teams. So in the end it looks like this : </p>
<pre><code>class Team(Model):
    name = CharField(max_length=50)

    def get_captain(self):
        return PlayerRole.objects.get(team=self).player

class Player(Model):
    first_name = CharField(max_length=50)
    last_name = CharField(max_length=50, blank=True)

    def get_team(self):
        return PlayerRole.objects.get(player=self).team

PLAYER_ROLES = (
    ("Regular", "Regular"),
    ("Captain", "Captain")
    )

class PlayerRole(Model):
    player = OneToOneField(Player, primary_key=True)
    team = ForeignKey(Team, null=True)
    role = CharField(max_length=20, choices=PLAYER_ROLES, default=PLAYER_ROLES[0][0])
    class Meta:
        unique_together = ("player", "team")
</code></pre>
<p>It might be slightly less efficient in terms of storage than the suggested workaround , but it avoids the circular dependency and keeps the DB structure clean and clear . Comments are welcome . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>Neither of the answers here are really that great - creating circular references is never a good idea. Imagine if your database crashed and you had to create it from scratch - how would you create player before team is created , and vice versa ? Look a question here : ForeignKey field with primary relationship one I asked a few days ago. Put a Boolean on <span style="background-color:yellow;">Player</span> that specifies the <span style="background-color:yellow;">captain</span> , and put some pre-save hooks that validate every team must have one-and-only-one <span style="background-color:yellow;">captain</span> . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Although there is nothing wrong with having two references to the same model , perhaps there is a better way to solve this particular problem . </p>
<p>Add a boolean to the <span style="background-color:yellow;">Team</span> model to identify a player + team combination as <span style="background-color:yellow;">captain</span> : </p>
<pre><code>class Team(models.Model):
  player = models.ForeignKey(Player)
  name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
  is_captain = models.BooleanField(default=False)
</code></pre>
<p>To search for a team 's <span style="background-color:yellow;">captain</span> : </p>
<p><span style="background-color:yellow;">Team.objects.filter</span> ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">is_captain</span> = True ) </p>
<p>Personally I do n't like this method because the search semantics do n't make sense ( ie , a " team " is not a " <span style="background-color:yellow;">captain</span> " ) . </p>
<p>The other approach is to identify each player 's position : </p>
<pre><code>class Player(models.Model):
   name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
   position = models.IntegerField(choices=((1,'Captain'),(2,'Goal Keeper'))
   jersey = models.IntegerField()

   def is_captain(self):
     return self.position == 1

class Team(models.Model):
   name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
   player = models.ForeignKey(Player)

   def get_captain(self):
      return self.player if self.player.position == 1 else None
</code></pre>
<p>This makes a bit more sense when you search : </p>
<p><span style="background-color:yellow;">Player.objects.filter</span> ( position = 1 ) ( return all <span style="background-color:yellow;">captains</span> ) </p>
<p><span style="background-color:yellow;">Team.objects.get</span> ( pk = 1 ) .get_captain ( ) ( return the <span style="background-color:yellow;">captain</span> for this team ) </p>
<p>In either case , however you have to do some pre save checks to make sure there is only one player for a particular position . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>Have a <span style="background-color:yellow;">Captain</span> table that has player/team columns along with your other tables , and make <span style="background-color:yellow;">captain</span> a method of <span style="background-color:yellow;">Team</span> : </p>
<pre><code>class Team(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField()
    def captain(self):
      [search Captain table]
      return thePlayer

class Player(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField()
    team = models.ForeignKey(Team)

class Captain(models.Model):
    player = models.ForeignKey(Player)
    team = models.ForeignKey(Team)
</code></pre>
<p>You 'd have to check that you never have more than one <span style="background-color:yellow;">captain</span> in the same team though... But you do n't have any circular references that way. You could also end up with a <span style="background-color:yellow;">captain</span> who is n't in the team he 's flagged as <span style="background-color:yellow;">captain</span> of. So there 's a few gotchas this way . </p>
