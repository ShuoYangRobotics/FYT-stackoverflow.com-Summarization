<h3>Question ( ID-8692 ) : </h3><h2>how to use <span style="background-color:yellow;">xpath</span> in python </h2><p>Is there a full implementation ? How is the library used , where is its website ? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-8 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p><span style="background-color:yellow;">libxml2</span> has a number of advantages : </p>
<ol>Compliance to the spec Active development and a community participation Speed. This is really a python wrapper around a C implementation . Ubiquity. The <span style="background-color:yellow;">libxml2</span> library is pervasive and thus well tested . </ol>
<p>Downsides include : </p>
<ol>Compliance to the spec . It 's strict. Things like default namespace handling are easier in other libraries . Use of native code. This can be a pain depending on your how your application is distributed / deployed. RPMs are available that ease some of this pain . Manual <span style="background-color:yellow;">resource</span> handling. Note in the sample below the calls to freeDoc ( ) and <span style="background-color:yellow;">xpathFreeContext</span> ( ) . This is not very Pythonic . </ol>
<p>If you are doing simple path selection , stick with <span style="background-color:yellow;">ElementTree</span> ( which is included in Python 2.5 ) . If you need full spec compliance or raw speed and can cope with the distribution of native code , go with <span style="background-color:yellow;">libxml2</span> . </p>
<p>Sample of <span style="background-color:yellow;">libxml2</span> XPath Use </p>
<pre><code>
import libxml2

doc = libxml2.parseFile("tst.xml")
ctxt = doc.xpathNewContext()
res = ctxt.xpathEval("//*")
if len(res) != 2:
    print "xpath query: wrong node set size"
    sys.exit(1)
if res[0].name != "doc" or res[1].name != "foo":
    print "xpath query: wrong node set value"
    sys.exit(1)
doc.freeDoc()
ctxt.xpathFreeContext()
</code></pre>
<p>Sample of <span style="background-color:yellow;">ElementTree</span> XPath Use </p>
<pre><code>

from elementtree.ElementTree import ElementTree
doc = ElementTree(file='tst.xml')
for e in mydata.findall('/foo/bar'):
    print e.get('title').text

</code></pre>

<br /><b># <span style="background-color:yellow;">1</span> </b><br /><p>The lxml package supports <span style="background-color:yellow;">xpath.</span> It seems to work pretty well , although I 've had some trouble with the self : : axis. There 's also Amara , but I have n't used it personally . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>Use LXML. LXML uses the full power of <span style="background-color:yellow;">libxml2</span> and libxslt , but wraps them in more " Pythonic " bindings than the Python bindings that are native to those libraries. As such , it gets the full XPath <span style="background-color:yellow;">1.0</span> implementation. Native ElemenTree supports a limited subset of XPath , although it may be good enough for your needs . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>Another option is py-dom-xpath http : //code.google.com/p/py-dom-xpath/ , it works seamlessly with minidom and is pure Python so works on appengine . </p>
<pre><code>import xpath
xpath.find('//item', doc)
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>The latest version of <span style="background-color:yellow;">elementtree</span> supports XPath pretty well. Not being an XPath expert I ca n't say for sure if the implementation is full but it has satisfied most of my needs when working in Python. I 've also use lxml and PyXML and I <span style="background-color:yellow;">find</span> etree nice because it 's a standard module . </p>
<p>NOTE : I 've since found lxml and for me it 's definitely the best XML lib out there for Python. It does XPath nicely as well ( though again perhaps not a full implementation ) . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>PyXML works well . </p>
<p>You did n't say what platform you 're using , however if you 're on Ubuntu you can get it with sudo apt-get install python-xml . I 'm sure other Linux distros have it as well . </p>
<p>If you 're on a Mac , <span style="background-color:yellow;">xpath</span> is already installed but not immediately accessible. You can set PY_USE_XMLPLUS in your environment or do it the Python way before you import <span style="background-color:yellow;">xml.xpath</span> : </p>
<pre><code>if sys.platform.startswith('darwin'):
    os.environ['PY_USE_XMLPLUS'] = '1'
</code></pre>
<p>In the worst case you may have to build it yourself. This package is no longer maintained but still builds fine and works with modern 2.x Pythons. Basic docs are here . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>You can use : </p>
<p>PyXML : </p>
<pre><code>from xml.dom.ext.reader import Sax2
from xml import xpath
doc = Sax2.FromXmlFile('foo.xml').documentElement
for url in xpath.Evaluate('//@Url', doc):
  print url.value
</code></pre>
<p><span style="background-color:yellow;">libxml2</span> : </p>
<pre><code>import libxml2
doc = libxml2.parseFile('foo.xml')
for url in doc.xpathEval('//@Url'):
  print url.content
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>Another library is 4Suite : http : //sourceforge.net/projects/foursuite/ </p>
<p>I do not know how spec-compliant it is. But it has worked very well for my use. It looks abandoned . </p>
