<h3>Question ( ID-262460 ) : </h3><h2>making a programme <span style="background-color:yellow;">run</span> indefinitely in python </h2><p>Is there any way to make a function ( the ones I 'm thinking of are in the style of the simple ones I 've made which generate the fibonnacci sequence from 0 to a point , and all the primes between two points ) <span style="background-color:yellow;">run</span> indefinitely. E.g. until I press a certain key or until a <span style="background-color:yellow;">time</span> has passed , rather than until a number reaches a certain point ? </p>
<p>Also , if it is based on <span style="background-color:yellow;">time</span> then is there any way I could just extend the <span style="background-color:yellow;">time</span> and start it going from that point again , rather than having to start again from 0 ? I am aware there is a <span style="background-color:yellow;">time</span> module , i just do n't know much about it . </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-7 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>The simplest way is just to write a program with an infinite loop , and then hit control-C to <span style="background-color:yellow;">stop</span> it. Without more description it 's hard to know if this works for you . </p>
<p>If you do it <span style="background-color:yellow;">time-based</span> , you do n't need a generator. You can just have it pause for user input , something like a " Continue ? [ y/n ] " , read from stdin , and depending on what you get either exit the loop or not . </p>
<br /><b># <span style="background-color:yellow;">1</span> </b><br /><p>As in almost all languages : </p>
<pre><code>while True:
  # check what you want and eventually break
  print nextValue()
</code></pre>
<p>The second part of your question is more interesting : </p>

<p>you can use a yield instead of return in the function nextValue ( ) </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>If you use a child thread to <span style="background-color:yellow;">run</span> the function while the main thread waits for character input it should work. Just remember to have something that <span style="background-color:yellow;">stops</span> the child thread ( in the example below the global <span style="background-color:yellow;">runthread</span> ) </p>
<p>For example : </p>
<pre><code>import threading, time
runthread = 1
def myfun():
   while runthread:
      print "A"
      time.sleep(.1)

t = threading.Thread(target=myfun)
t.start()
raw_input("")
runthread = 0
t.join()
</code></pre>
<p>does just that </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>If you really want your function to <span style="background-color:yellow;">run</span> and still wants user ( or system ) input , you have two solutions : </p>
<ol>multi-thread multi-process </ol>
<p>It will depend on how fine the interaction. If you just want to interrupt the function and do n't care about the exit , then multi-process is fine . </p>
<p>In both cases , you can rely on some shared resources ( file or shared memory for multi-thread , variable with associated mutex for multi-thread ) and check for the state of that resource regularly in your function. If it is set up to tell you to quit , just do it . </p>
<p>Example on multi-thread : </p>
<pre><code>from threading import Thread, Lock
from time import sleep

class MyFct(Thread):
    def __init__(self):
        Thread.__init__(self)
        self.mutex = Lock()
        self._quit = False

    def stopped(self):
        self.mutex.acquire()
        val = self._quit
        self.mutex.release()
        return val

    def stop(self):
        self.mutex.acquire()
        self._quit = True
        self.mutex.release()

    def run(self):
        i = 1
        j = 1
        print i
        print j
        while True:
            if self.stopped():
                return
            i,j = j,i+j
            print j

def main_fct():
    t = MyFct()
    t.start()
    sleep(1)
    t.stop()
    t.join()
    print "Exited"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main_fct()

<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>If you want to exit based on <span style="background-color:yellow;">time</span> , you can use the signal module 's alarm ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">time</span> ) function , and the catch the SIGALRM - here 's an example http : //docs.python.org/library/signal.html # example </p>
<p>You can let the user interrupt the program in a sane manner by catching KeyboardInterrupt. Simply catch the KeyboardInterrupt exception from outside you main loop , and do whatever cleanup you want . </p>
<p>If you want to continue later where you left off , you will have to add some sort persistence. I would pickle a data structure to disk , that you could read back in to continue the operations . </p>
<p>I have n't tried anything like this , but you could look into using something like memoizing , and caching to the disk . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>You could use a generator for this : </p>
<pre><code>def finished():
    "Define your exit condition here"
    return ...

def count(i=0):
    while not finished():
        yield i
        i += 1

for i in count():
    print i
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to change the exit condition you could pass a value back into the generator function and use that value to determine when to exit . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>You could do something like this to generate fibonnacci numbers for <span style="background-color:yellow;">1</span> second then <span style="background-color:yellow;">stop</span> . </p>
<pre><code>fibonnacci = [1,1]
stoptime = time.time() + 1 # set stop time to 1 second in the future
while time.time() < stoptime:
  fibonnacci.append(fibonnacci[-1]+fibonnacci[-2])

print "Generated %s numbers, the last one was %s." % (len(fibonnacci),fibonnacci[-1])
</code></pre>
<p>I 'm not sure how efficient it is to call <span style="background-color:yellow;">time.time</span> ( ) in every loop - depending on the what you are doing inside the loop , it might end up taking a lot of the performance away . </p>
