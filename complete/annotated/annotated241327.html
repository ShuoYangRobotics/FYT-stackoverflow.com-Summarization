<h3>Question ( ID-241327 ) : </h3><h2>Python snippet to remove C and C + + comments </h2><p>I 'm looking for Python code that removes C and C + + comments from a string. ( Assume the string contains an entire C source file. ) </p>
<p>I realize that I could .match ( ) substrings with a Regex , but that does n't solve nesting / * , or having a // inside a / * * / . </p>
<p>Ideally , I would prefer a non-naive implementation that properly handles awkward cases . </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-11 ) : </h3><b># <span style="background-color:yellow;">0</span> </b><br /><p>C ( and C + + ) comments can not be nested. Regular expressions work well : </p>
<pre><code>//.*?\n|/\*.*?\*/
</code></pre>
<p>This requires the â€œSingle lineâ€? flag (<code>Re.S</code>) because a C comment can span multiple lines.</p>
<pre><code>def stripcomments(text):
    return re.sub('//.*?\n|/\*.*?\*/', '', text, re.S)
</code></pre>
<p>This code should work . </p>
<p>/EDIT : Notice that my above code actually makes an assumption about <span style="background-color:yellow;">line</span> endings ! This code wo n't work on a Mac <span style="background-color:yellow;">text</span> file. However , this can be amended relatively easily : </p>
<pre><code>//.*?(\r\n?|\n)|/\*.*?\*/
</code></pre>
<p>This regular expression should work on all <span style="background-color:yellow;">text</span> files , regardless of their <span style="background-color:yellow;">line</span> endings ( covers Windows , Unix and Mac <span style="background-color:yellow;">line</span> endings ) . </p>
<p>/EDIT : MizardX and Brian ( in the comments ) made a valid remark about the handling of strings. I completely forgot about that because the above regex is plucked from a parsing module that has additional handling for strings. MizardX 's solution should work very well but it only handles double-quoted strings . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>This handles C + + -style comments , C-style comments , strings and simple nesting thereof . </p>
<pre><code>def comment_remover(text):
    def replacer(match):
        s = match.group(0)
        if s.startswith('/'):
            return ""
        else:
            return s
    pattern = re.compile(
        r'//.*?$|/\*.*?\*/|\'(?:\\.|[^\\\'])*\'|"(?:\\.|[^\\"])*"',
        re.DOTALL | re.MULTILINE
    )
    return re.sub(pattern, replacer, text)
</code></pre>
<p>Strings needs to be included , because comment-markers inside them does not start a comment . </p>
<p>Edit : re.sub did n't take any flags , so had to compile the pattern first . </p>
<p>Edit2 : Added character literals , since they could contain quotes that would otherwise be recognized as string delimiters . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>I do n't know if you 're familiar with sed , the UNIX-based ( but Windows-available ) <span style="background-color:yellow;">text</span> parsing program , but I 've found a sed script here which will remove C/C + + comments from a file. It 's very smart ; for example , it will ignore '// ' and '/ * ' if found in a string declaration , etc. From within Python , it can be used using the following code : </p>
<pre><code>import subprocess
from cStringIO import StringIO

input = StringIO(source_code) # source_code is a string with the source code.
output = StringIO()

process = subprocess.Popen(['sed', '/path/to/remccoms3.sed'],
    input=input, output=output)
return_code = process.wait()

stripped_code = output.getvalue()
</code></pre>
<p>In this program , <span style="background-color:yellow;">source_code</span> is the variable holding the C/C + + source code , and eventually stripped_code will hold C/C + + code with the comments removed. Of course , if you have the file on disk , you could have the input and output variables be file handles pointing to those files ( input in read-mode , output in write-mode ) . remccoms3.sed is the file from the above link , and it should be saved in a readable location on disk. sed is also available on Windows , and comes installed by default on most GNU/Linux distros and Mac OS X . </p>
<p>This will probably be better than a pure Python solution ; no need to reinvent the wheel . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>Do n't forget that in C , backslash-newline is eliminated before comments are processed , and trigraphs are processed before that ( because ? ? / is the trigraph for backslash ) . I have a C program called SCC ( strip C/C + + comments ) , and here is part of the test code.. . </p>
<pre><code>" */ /* SCC has been trained to know about strings /* */ */"!
"\"Double quotes embedded in strings, \\\" too\'!"
"And \
newlines in them"

"And escaped double quotes at the end of a string\""

aa '\\
n' OK
aa "\""
aa "\

<p>This does not illustrate trigraphs. Note that you can have multiple backslashes at the end of a <span style="background-color:yellow;">line</span> , but the <span style="background-color:yellow;">line</span> splicing does n't care about how many there are , but the subsequent processing might. Etc. Writing a single regex to handle all these cases will be non-trivial ( but that is different from impossible ) . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>The regular expression cases will fall down in some situations , like where a string literal contains a subsequence which <span style="background-color:yellow;">matches</span> the comment syntax. You really need a parse tree to deal with this . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>you may be able to leverage py + + to parse the C + + source with GCC . </p>
<blockquote>Py + + does not reinvent the wheel. It uses GCC C + + compiler to parse C + + source files. To be more precise , the tool chain looks like this : source code is passed to GCC-XML GCC-XML passes it to GCC C + + compiler GCC-XML generates an XML description of a C + + program from GCC 's internal representation. Py + + uses pygccxml package to read GCC-XML generated file. The bottom <span style="background-color:yellow;">line</span> - you can be sure , that all your declarations are read correctly . </blockquote>
<p>or , maybe not. regardless , this is not a trivial parse . </p>
<p>@ RE based solutions - you are unlikely to find a RE that handles all possible 'awkward ' cases correctly , unless you constrain input ( e.g. no macros ) . for a bulletproof solution , you really have no choice than leveraging the real grammar . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>You may find some of the discussion in this Q &amp ; A helpful and especially this particular reply ( mainly from the standpoint of pitfalls to watch out for ) . </p>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>You do n't really need a parse tree to do this perfectly , but you do in effect need the token stream equivalent to what is produced by the compiler 's front end. Such a token stream must necessarilyy take care of all the weirdness such as <span style="background-color:yellow;">line-continued</span> comment start , comment start in string , trigraph normalization , etc. If you have the token stream , deleting the comments is easy. ( I have a tool that produces exactly such token streams , as , guess what , the front end of a real parser that produces a real parse tree : ) . </p>
<p>The fact that the tokens are individually recognized by regular expressions suggests that you can , in principle , write a regular expression that will pick out the comment lexemes. The real complexity of the set regular expressions for the tokenizer ( at least the one we wrote ) suggests you ca n't do this in practice ; writing them individually was hard enough. If you do n't want to do it perfectly , well , then , most of the RE solutions above are just fine . </p>
<p>Now , why you would want strip comments is beyond me , unless you are building a code obfuscator. In this case , you have to have it perfectly right . </p>
<br /><b># 8 </b><br /><p>I 'm sorry this not a Python solution , but you could also use a tool that understands how to remove comments , like your C/C + + preprocessor. Here 's how GNU CPP does it . </p>
<pre><code>cpp -fpreprocessed foo.c
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 9 </b><br /><p>There is also a non-python answer : use the program stripcmt : </p>
<blockquote>StripCmt is a simple utility written in C to remove comments from C , C + + , and Java source files. In the grand tradition of Unix <span style="background-color:yellow;">text</span> processing programs , it can function either as a FIFO ( First In - First Out ) filter or accept arguments on the commandline . </blockquote>
<br /><b># 10 </b><br /><p>I ran across this problem recently when I took a class where the professor required us to strip javadoc from our source code before submitting it to him for a code review. We had to do this several times , but we could n't just remove the javadoc permanently because we were required to generate javadoc html files as well. Here is a little python script I made to do the trick. Since javadoc starts with / * * and ends with * / , the script looks for these tokens , but the script can be modified to suite your needs. It also handles single <span style="background-color:yellow;">line</span> block comments and cases where a block comment ends but there is still non-commented code on the same <span style="background-color:yellow;">line</span> as the block comment ending. I hope this helps ! </p>
<p>WARNING : This scripts modifies the contents of files passed in and saves them to the original files. It would be wise to have a backup somewhere else </p>
