<h3>Question ( ID-366682 ) : </h3><h2>How to limit execution time of a function call in Python </h2><p>There is a socket related function call in my code , that function is from another module thus out of my control , the problem is that it blocks for hours occasionally , which is totally unacceptable , How can I limit the function execution time from my code ? I guess the solution must utilize another thread . </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-6 ) : </h3><b># <span style="background-color:yellow;">0</span> </b><br /><p>I 'm not sure how cross-platform this might be , but using <span style="background-color:yellow;">signals</span> and <span style="background-color:yellow;">alarm</span> might be a good way of looking at this. With a little work you could make this completely generic as well and usable in any situation . </p>
<p>http : //docs.python.org/library/signal.html </p>
<p>So your code is going to look something like this . </p>
<pre><code>import signal

def signal_handler(signum, frame):
    raise Exception("Timed out!")

signal.signal(signal.SIGALRM, signal_handler)
signal.alarm(10)   # Ten seconds
try:
    long_function_call()
catch Exception, msg:
    print "Timed out!"

<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>An improvement on @ rik.the.vik 's answer would be to use the with statement to give the <span style="background-color:yellow;">timeout</span> function some syntactic sugar : </p>
<pre><code>from __future__ import with_statement # Required in 2.5
import signal
from contextlib import contextmanager

class TimeoutException(Exception): pass

@contextmanager
def time_limit(seconds):
    def signal_handler(signum, frame):
        raise TimeoutException, "Timed out!"
    signal.signal(signal.SIGALRM, signal_handler)
    signal.alarm(seconds)
    try:
        yield
    finally:
        signal.alarm(0)


try:
    with time_limit(10):
        long_function_call()
except TimeoutException, msg:
    print "Timed out!"

<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>You do n't have to use threads. You can use another process to do the blocking work , for instance , maybe using the subprocess module. If you want to share data structures between different parts of your program then Twisted is a great library for giving yourself control of this , and I 'd recommend it if you care about blocking and expect to have this trouble a lot. The bad news with Twisted is you have to rewrite your code to avoid any blocking , and there is a fair learning curve . </p>
<p>You can use threads to avoid blocking , but I 'd regard this as a last resort , since it exposes you to a whole world of pain. Read a good book on concurrency before even thinking about using threads in production , e.g. Jean Bacon 's " Concurrent Systems " . I work with a bunch of people who do really cool high performance stuff with threads , and we do n't introduce threads into projects unless we really need them . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>The only " safe " way to do this , in any language , is to use a secondary process to do that <span style="background-color:yellow;">timeout-thing</span> , otherwise you need to build your code in such a way that it will time out safely by itself , for instance by checking the time elapsed in a loop or similar. If changing the method is n't an option , a thread will not suffice . </p>
<p>Why ? Because you 're risking leaving things in a bad state when you do. If the thread is simply killed mid-method , locks being held , etc. will just be held , and can not be released . </p>
<p>So look at the process way , do not look at the thread way . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Doing this from within a <span style="background-color:yellow;">signal</span> handler is dangerous : you might be inside an exception handler at the time the exception is raised , and leave things in a broken state. For example, </p>
<pre><code>def function_with_enforced_timeout():
  f = open_temporary_file()
  try:
   ...
  finally:
   here()
   unlink(f.filename)
</code></pre>
<p>If your exception is raised here ( ) , the temporary file will never be deleted . </p>
<p>The solution here is for asynchronous exceptions to be postponed until the code is not inside exception-handling code ( an except or finally block ) , but Python does n't do that . </p>
<p>Note that this wo n't interrupt anything while executing native code ; it 'll only interrupt it when the function returns , so this may not help this particular case. ( SIGALRM itself might interrupt the call that 's blocking--but socket code typically simply retries after an EINTR. ) </p>
<p>Doing this with threads is a better idea , since it 's more portable than <span style="background-color:yellow;">signals.</span> Since you 're starting a worker thread and blocking until it finishes , there are none of the usual concurrency worries. Unfortunately , there 's no way to deliver an exception asynchronously to another thread in Python ( other thread APIs can do this ) . It 'll also have the same issue with sending an exception during an exception handler , and require the same fix . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>Here 's a <span style="background-color:yellow;">timeout</span> function I think I found via google and it works for me . </p>
<p>From : http : //code.activestate.com/recipes/473878/ </p>
<pre><code>def timeout(func, args=(), kwargs={}, timeout_duration=1, default=None):
    '''This function will spwan a thread and run the given function using the args, kwargs and 
    return the given default value if the timeout_duration is exceeded 
    ''' 
    import threading
    class InterruptableThread(threading.Thread):
        def __init__(self):
            threading.Thread.__init__(self)

        def run(self):
            try:
                self.result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            except:
                self.result = default
    it = InterruptableThread()
    it.start()
    it.join(timeout_duration)
    if it.isAlive():
