<h3>Question ( ID-5943425 ) : </h3><h2>Is there a dataset in python similar to structs in C + + ? </h2><p>Is there a dataset in python similar to structs in C + + ? I like the struct feature myStruct.someName . I know , that classes have this , but I do n't want to write a class everytime I need a " container " for some data. = ) </p>

<p>If you want to save some memory , you might also want to use __slots__ so the <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> do n't have a __dict__ . See http : //docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html # slots for details and Python __slots__ for some useful information . </p>
<p>For example , a class holding only two values ( a and b ) could looks like this : </p>
<pre><code>class AB(object):
    __slots__ = ('a', 'b')
</code></pre>
<hr />
<p>If you actually want a dict but with obj.item access instead of obj [ 'item ' ] , you could subclass dict and implement __getattr__ and __setattr__ to behave like __getitem__ and __setitem__ . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>Please realise that in C + + , the only difference between a class and a struct is that the elements of a class are by default private , as is the inheritance. The following are equivalent : </p>
<pre><code>class D : public B {
    public:
    ...
}; 

struct D {
    ...
};
</code></pre>
<p>In Python , it would make most sense to use a class if you want to use the dot operator to access elements. In fact , it 's even easier , as you only have to initialise the members you currently want , and can add/remove members later. Therefore , the following would work : </p>
<pre><code>class D(object):
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>You can then add as many members as you want simply by assigning to them . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>In addition to the dict type , there is a namedtuple type that behaves somewhat like a struct . </p>
<pre><code>MyStruct = namedtuple('MyStruct', ['someName', 'anotherName'])
aStruct = MyStruct('aValue', 'anotherValue')

print aStruct.someName, aStruct.anotherName
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>I believe you 're looking for a dict . </p>
<pre><code>d = dict({
        'name': 'myname',
        'val': 'myval'
        })

print d
print d['name']
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Try using a dict . </p>
<p>Here 's a simplistic demonstration . </p>
<pre><code>>>> something = {}
>>> something['x'] = 42
>>> something['y'] = 'cheese'
>>> something
{'y': 'cheese', 'x': 42}
>>> something['x']
42
>>> something['y']
'cheese'
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>You can always go for the dynamic approach : </p>
<pre><code>class foo(object):
    def __init__(self,**kwargs):
        self.__dict__.update(kwargs)
</code></pre>
<p>This 'll make a class with the same methods that you pass in as a dict : </p>
<pre><code>bar = foo(bill="yo",heather="hi",sam="piss off")
</code></pre>
<p>leaving you with the following perfectly valid calls on bar : </p>
<pre><code>bar.bill
>> "yo"
bar.heater
>> "hi"
</code></pre>
<p>you get the idea.. . </p>
