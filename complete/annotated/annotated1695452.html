<h3>Question ( ID-1695452 ) : </h3><h2>Searching values of a list in another List using Python </h2><p>Im a trying to find a sublist of a list. Meaning if list1 say [ 1,5 ] is in list2 say [ 1,4,3,5,6 ] than it should return True. What I have so far is this : </p>
<pre><code>for nums in l1:
    if nums in l2:
        return True
    else:
        return False
</code></pre>
<p>This would be true but I 'm trying to return True only if list1 is in list2 in the respective order. So if list2 is [ 5,2,3,4,1 ] , it should return False. I was thinking along the lines of comparing the index values of list1 using &lt ; but I 'm not sure . </p>

  last_found = -1
  for num in L1:
     last_found = L2.index(num, last_found + 1)
  return True
except ValueError:
  return False
</code></pre>
<p>The index method of list <span style="background-color:yellow;">L2</span> returns the position at which the first argument ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">num</span> ) is found in the list ; called , like here , with a second arg , it starts looking in the list at that position. If index does not find what it 's looking for , it raises a ValueError exception . </p>
<p>So , this code uses this approach to look for each item <span style="background-color:yellow;">num</span> of <span style="background-color:yellow;">L1</span> , in order , inside <span style="background-color:yellow;">L2</span> . The first time it <span style="background-color:yellow;">needs</span> to start looking from position 0 ; each following time , it <span style="background-color:yellow;">needs</span> to start looking from the position just after the last one where it found the previous item , i.e. last_found + 1 ( so at the start we must set last_found = -1 to start looking from position 0 the first time ) . </p>
<p>If every item in <span style="background-color:yellow;">L1</span> is found this way ( i.e. it 's found in <span style="background-color:yellow;">L2</span> after the position where the previous item was found ) , then the two lists meet the given condition and the code returns True . If any item of <span style="background-color:yellow;">L1</span> is ever not-found , the code catches the resulting ValueError exception and just returns False . </p>
<p>A different approach would be to use iterators over the two lists , that can be formed with the iter built-in function. You can " advance " an iterator by calling built-in <span style="background-color:yellow;">next</span> on it ; this will raise StopIteration if there is no " <span style="background-color:yellow;">next</span> item " , i.e. , the iterator is exhausted. You can also use for on the iterator for a somewhat smoother interface , where applicable. The low-level approach using the iter/next idea : </p>
<pre><code>i1 = iter(L1)
i2 = iter(L2)
while True:
  try:
    lookfor = next(i1)
  except StopIteration:
    # no more items to look for == all good!
    return True
  while True:
    try:
      maybe = next(i2)
    except StopIteration:
      # item lookfor never matched == nope!
      return False
    if maybe == lookfor:
      break
</code></pre>
<p>or , a bit higher-level : </p>
<pre><code>i1 = iter(L1)
i2 = iter(L2)
for lookfor in i1:
  for maybe in i2:
    if maybe == lookfor:
      break
  else:
    # item lookfor never matched == nope!
    return False
# no more items to look for == all good!
return True
</code></pre>
<p>In fact , the only crucial use of iter here is to get <span style="background-color:yellow;">i2</span> -- having the inner loop as for maybe in <span style="background-color:yellow;">i2</span> guarantees the inner loop wo n't start looking from the beginning every time , but , rather , it will keep looking where it last left off. The outer loop might as well for for lookfor in <span style="background-color:yellow;">L1</span> : , since it has no " restarting " issue . </p>
<p>Key , here , is the else : clause of loops , which triggers if , and only if , the loop was not interrupted by break but rather exited naturally . </p>
<p>Working further on this idea we are again reminded of the in <span style="background-color:yellow;">operator</span> , which also can be made to continue where it last left off simply by using an iterator. Big simplification : </p>
<pre><code>i2 = iter(L2)
for lookfor in L1:
  if lookfor not in i2:
    return False
# no more items to look for == all good!
return True
</code></pre>
<p>But now we recognize that is exactly the patter abstracted by the short-circuiting any and all built-in " short-circuiting accumulator " functions , so... : </p>
<pre><code>i2 = iter(L2)
return all(lookfor in i2 for lookfor in L1)
</code></pre>
<p>which I believe is just about as simple as you can get. The only non-elementary bit left here is : you <span style="background-color:yellow;">need</span> to use an iter ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">L2</span> ) explicitly , just once , to make sure the in <span style="background-color:yellow;">operator</span> ( intrinsically an inner loop ) does n't restart the search from the beginning but rather continues each time from where it last left off . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>This question looks a bit like homework and for this reason I 'd like to take the time and discuss what may be going wrong with the snippet shown in the question . </p>
<p>Although you are using a word in its plural form , for the <span style="background-color:yellow;">nums</span> variable , you <span style="background-color:yellow;">need</span> to understand that Python will use this variable to store ONE item from <span style="background-color:yellow;">l1</span> at a time , and go through the block of code in this " for block " , one time for each different item . </p>
<p>The result of your current snippet will therefore be to exit upon the very first iteration , with either True or False depending if by chance the first items in the list happen to match . </p>
<p>Edit : Yes , A1 , exactly as you said : the logic exits with True after the first iteration. This is because of the " return " when <span style="background-color:yellow;">nums</span> is found in <span style="background-color:yellow;">l2</span> . If you were to do nothing in the " found " case , the loop the logic would proceed with finishing whatever logic in the block ( none here ) and it would then start the <span style="background-color:yellow;">next</span> iteration. Therefore it would only exit with a " False " return value , in the case when an item from <span style="background-color:yellow;">l1</span> is not found <span style="background-color:yellow;">l2</span> ( indeed after the very first such not-found item ) . Therefore your logic is almost correct ( if it were to do nothing in the " found case " ) , the one thing missing would be to return " True " , systematically after the for loop ( since if it did n't exit with a False value within the loop , then all items of <span style="background-color:yellow;">l2</span> are in <span style="background-color:yellow;">l1...</span> ) . </p>
<p>There are two ways to modify the code so it does nothing for the " found case " . - by using pass , which is a convenient way to instruct Python to do nothing ; " pass " is typically used when " something " , i.e. some action is syntactically required but we do n't want anything done , but it can also be used when debugging etc . - by rewriting the <span style="background-color:yellow;">test</span> as a " not in " instead </p>
<pre><code>if nums not in l2:
   return False
#no else:, i.e. do nothing at all if found
</code></pre>
<p>Now... Getting into more details . There may be a flaw in your program ( with the suggested changes ) , that is that it would consider <span style="background-color:yellow;">l1</span> to be a sublist of <span style="background-color:yellow;">l2</span> , even if <span style="background-color:yellow;">l1</span> had say 2 items with value say 5 whereby <span style="background-color:yellow;">l2</span> only had one such value. I 'm not sure if that kind of consideration is part of the problem ( possibly the understanding is that both lists are " sets " , with no possible duplicate items ) . If duplicates were allowed however , you would have to complicate the logic somewhat ( a possible approach would be to intitially make a copy of <span style="background-color:yellow;">l2</span> and each time " <span style="background-color:yellow;">nums</span> " is find in the <span style="background-color:yellow;">l2</span> copy , to remove this item . </p>
<p>Another consideration is that maybe a list can only be said to be a sublist if its items are found the same order as the items in the other list... Again it all depends on the way the problem is defined... BTW some of the solutions proposed , like Alex Martelli 's are written in such fashion because they solve the problem in a way that the order of items with the lists matter . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>I think this solution is the fastest , since it iterates only once , albeit on the longer list and exits before finishing the iteration if a match is found. ( Edit : However , it is not as succinct or as fast as Alex 's latest solution ) </p>
<pre><code>def ck(l1,l2):
    i,j = 0,len(l1)
    for e in l2:
        if e == l1[i]:
            i += 1
        if i == j:
            return True
    return False

<p>An improvement was suggested by Anurag Uniyal ( see comment ) and is reflected in the showdown below . </p>
<p>Here are some speed results for a range of list size ratios ( List <span style="background-color:yellow;">l1</span> is a 10-element list containing <span style="background-color:yellow;">random</span> values from 1-10. List <span style="background-color:yellow;">l2</span> ranges from 10-1000 in length ( and also contain <span style="background-color:yellow;">random</span> values from 1-10 ) . </p>
