<h3>Question ( ID-1635027 ) : </h3><h2>What 's the simplest cross-platform way to pop up graphical dialogs in Python ? </h2><p>I want the simplest possible way to pop up simple dialogs in Python scripts. Ideally , the solution would : </p>
<ul>Work on Windows , OS X , Gnome , KDE Look like a native dialog on any OS Require minimal code </ul>
<p>To pop up a simple standard dialog should require only minimal code. Essentially you 're just saying " Pop up a standard dialog with this text " , or " Pop up a dialog with question x and feed response into variable y " . </p>
<p>I do n't want to know about GUI frameworks or have to set up code that says " start a GUI thread , register an event handler , configure some window properties , run a loop " , etc. I do n't want to have to set up a window or close the window afterward. I give it the text to put in the window , it tells me what the user clicked on. Everything else should be taken care of automatically . </p>
<p>I 've listed Zenity and EasyGUI as example answers , since they 're similar to what I want , but not perfect . </p>

<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-9 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>TkInter is usually supplied with Python </p>
<pre><code># File: hello1.py

from Tkinter import *

root = Tk()

w = Label(root, text="Hello, world!")
w.pack()

root.mainloop()
</code></pre>
<p>If you want something more native looking , you 'll have to install something like <span style="background-color:yellow;">wxpython</span> </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>EasyGUI is a single file , and provides a simple way to work with <span style="background-color:yellow;">Tkinter</span> dialogs , but they 're still ugly non-native <span style="background-color:yellow;">Tkinter</span> dialogs . </p>
<pre><code>from easygui import msgbox
msgbox('Stuff')
</code></pre>
<p></p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>Zenity works under Linux and Windows , and can be called from Python directly : </p>
<pre><code>import os
os.system('zenity --info --text="Stuff"')
</code></pre>
<p>The return values from question boxes need to be captured for acting on , though , which is more complex , and you have to learn about communicating with subprocesses , etc . </p>
<p>It can also be used with the <span style="background-color:yellow;">PyZenity</span> front-end , which makes capturing return values simple : </p>
<pre><code>from PyZenity import InfoMessage
InfoMessage('Stuff')
</code></pre>
<p>I have tested <span style="background-color:yellow;">PyZenity</span> in both Ubuntu and Windows XP , and it works in both . </p>
<p></p>
<p>I read that Zenity is GTK + only , but I tried it in Gnome and KDE and it looks native in both. The port to Windows does not look native , though , because it uses the wrong GTK theme ? </p>
<p>There are also other programs like KDialog and Xdialog that might be interfaced to a similar Python frontend that could check and see what executables are available so that it automatically takes care of everything ? ( There 's a Ruby frontend for KDialog , too. ) </p>
<p>I do n't know if <span style="background-color:yellow;">PyZenity</span> works under OS X , either . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>To extend on endolith 's <span style="background-color:yellow;">tkMessageBox</span> answer with the ugly empty window in the background.. . </p>
<p>The code below pops up the box without the background window . </p>
<pre><code>import Tkinter, tkMessageBox
root = Tkinter.Tk()
root.withdraw()
tkMessageBox.showinfo("my dialog title", "my dialog message")
</code></pre>
<p>This is lifted directly from a useful comment I found at the bottom of this article . Thanks to Jason ( the commenter ) and effbot.org . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>@ endolith , re : zenity for Windows . </p>
<p>Hi, </p>
<p>I repackaged " Zenity for Windows " and included the correct GTK-theme file. It looks much better now. : ) It is now available for download : http : //www.placella.com/software/zenity/ </p>

<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>Another possibility is the <span style="background-color:yellow;">tkMessageBox</span> module , which is apparently built into the standard library and is cross-platform , though this is even more ugly than the rest : </p>
<pre><code>import tkMessageBox
tkMessageBox.showinfo('Title','Stuff')
</code></pre>
<p></p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p><span style="background-color:yellow;">wxPython</span> is the best Python GUI library ( IMO ) and uses native widgets . </p>
<pre><code>import wx
app = wx.PySimpleApp()
dialog = wx.MessageDialog(None, 'wxPython is awesome!', 'Dialog Box', wx.OK|wx.ICON_INFORMATION)
dialog.ShowModal()
dialog.Destroy()
app.MainLoop()
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p><span style="background-color:yellow;">pyglet</span> is another alternative , though it may not be the simplest. that being said , it 's cross-platform and only depends on python , so there 's no external dependencies. that fact alone can be reason enough to use it over others . </p>
<p>and all it can handle multimedia pretty easily as well , pretty handy if you want to display an image or video or something . </p>
<p>the example below is from the documentation.. . </p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python
import pyglet
window = pyglet.window.Window()
label = pyglet.text.Label('Hello, world',
                      font_name='Times New Roman',
                      font_size=36,
                      x=window.width/2, y=window.height/2,
                      anchor_x='center', anchor_y='center')

@window.event
def on_draw():
    window.clear()
    label.draw()

pyglet.app.run()
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 8 </b><br /><p>This is not possible. If you want simple then you have to use <span style="background-color:yellow;">Tkinter</span> because that is what is included. If <span style="background-color:yellow;">Tkinter</span> is not good enough then you will have to choose and package a GUI for each platform separately . </p>
<p>I suggest that you do use <span style="background-color:yellow;">Tkinter</span> and wrap the parts that you need in a class that will be even simpler to use . </p>
