<h3>Question ( ID-1015592 ) : </h3><h2>Why is ` <span style="background-color:yellow;">self</span> ` in Python <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> immutable ? </h2><p>Why ca n't I perform an action like the following : </p>
<pre><code>class Test(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self = 5

t = Test()
print t
</code></pre>
<p>I would expect it to print 5 since we 're overwriting the instance with it , but instead it does n't do anything at all. Does n't even throw an error. Just ignores the assignment . </p>
<p>I understand that there would be hardly any situations where one would want to do that , but it still seems odd that you ca n't . </p>
<p>Update : I now understand why it does n't work , but I 'd still like to know if there is any way of replacing an instance from within the instance . </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-6 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>Any simple assignment to any argument of any function behaves exactly the same way in Python : binds that name to a different value , and does nothing else whatsoever. " No special case is special enough to break the rules " , as the Zen of Python says ! - ) </p>
<p>So , far from it being odd ( that simply = assigning to a specific argument in a specific function has no externally visible effect whatsoever ) , it would be utterly astonishing if this specific case worked in any other way , just because of the names of the function and argument in question . </p>
<p>Should you ever want to make a class that constructs an <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> of a different type than itself , such behavior is of course quite possible -- but it 's obtained by overriding the special method <span style="background-color:yellow;">__new__</span> , not <span style="background-color:yellow;">__init__</span> : </p>
<pre><code>class Test(object):
    def __new__(cls):
        return 5

t = Test()
print t
</code></pre>
<p>This does emit 5 . The <span style="background-color:yellow;">__new__</span> / <span style="background-color:yellow;">__init__</span> behavior in Python is an example of the " two-step construction " design pattern : the " constructor " proper is <span style="background-color:yellow;">__new__</span> ( it builds and returns a ( normally uninitialized ) <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> ( normally a new one of the type/class in question ) ; <span style="background-color:yellow;">__init__</span> is the " initializer " which properly initializes the new <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> . </p>
<p>This allows , for example , the construction of <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> that are immutable once constructed : in this case everything must be done in <span style="background-color:yellow;">__new__</span> , before the immutable <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> is constructed , since , given that the <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> is immutable , <span style="background-color:yellow;">__init__</span> can not mutate it in order to initialize it . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>It doesnt " ignore " the assignment. The assignment works just fine , you created a local name that points to the data 5 . </p>
<p>If you really want to do what you are doing.. . </p>
<pre><code>class Test(object):
    def __new__(*args):
        return 5
</code></pre>
<br /><b># <span style="background-color:yellow;">2</span> </b><br /><p>I just ran a quick test , and you can assign to <span style="background-color:yellow;">self.</span> Inside your init ( ) method , print out the value of <span style="background-color:yellow;">self.</span> You 'll see that it 's 5 . </p>
<p>What you 're missing here is that parameters are passed by value in Python. So , changing the value of a variable in a function or method wo n't change it for the outside world . </p>
<p>All that being said , I would strongly advise against ever changing <span style="background-color:yellow;">self</span> . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>Dr. Egon Spengler : It would be bad . Dr. Peter Venkman : I 'm fuzzy on the whole good/bad thing. What do you mean , " bad " ? Dr. Egon Spengler : Try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and every molecule in your body exploding at the speed of light . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Sometimes you want to do this , though not with immutable types like int : </p>
<pre><code>>>> class Test(list):
    ... def __init__(self):
    ...    list.__init__(self, [1,2,3])   # self = [1,2,3] seems right, but isn't

>> t = Test()
>> print t
[1, 2, 3]
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><pre><code>class Test(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self = 5

t = Test()
print t
</code></pre>
<p>is like having this PHP ( only other lang i know , sorry ) </p>
<pre><code>class Test {
    function __construct() {
            $this = 5;
        }
}
</code></pre>
<p>I do n't see how it makes sense. replacing the instance with a value ? </p>
