<h3>Question ( ID-553784 ) : </h3><h2>Can you use a string to instantiate a class in python ? </h2><p>I 'm using a <span style="background-color:yellow;">builder</span> pattern to seperate a bunch of different configuration possibilities. <span style="background-color:yellow;">Basically</span> , I have a bunch of classes that are named an ID ( something like <span style="background-color:yellow;">ID12345</span> ) . These all inherit from the base <span style="background-color:yellow;">builder</span> class. In my script , I need to instantiate an <span style="background-color:yellow;">instance</span> for each class ( about 50 ) every time this app runs. So , I 'm trying to see if instead of doing something like this : </p>
<pre><code>ProcessDirector = ProcessDirector()
ID12345 = ID12345()
ID01234 = ID01234()

ProcessDirector.construct(ID12345)
ProcessDirector.construct(ID01234)

ID12345.run()
ID01234.run()
</code></pre>
<p>Can I do something like this ( I know this does n't work ) : </p>
<pre><code>IDS = ["ID12345", "ID01234"]

ProcessDirector = ProcessDirector()
for id in IDS:
  builder = id() #some how instantiate class from string
  ProcessDirector.construct(builder)
  builder.run()
</code></pre>
<p>That way , when I need to add a new one in the future , all I have to do is add the <span style="background-color:yellow;">id</span> to the IDS list , rather than peppering the new ID throughout the code . </p>
<h2>EDIT </h2>
<p>Looks like there are some different opinions based on where the data is coming from. These IDs are entered in a file that no one else has access to. I 'm not reading the strings from the command line , and I 'd like to be able to do as little alteration when adding a new ID in the future . </p>

<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>Never use eval ( ) if you can help it. Python has so many better options ( dispatch dictionary , getattr ( ) , etc. ) that you should never have to use the security hole known as eval ( ) . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>Not totally sure this is what you want , but it seems like a more Python'y way to instantiate a bunch of classes listed in a string : </p>
<pre><code>class idClasses:
    class ID12345:pass
    class ID01234:pass
# could also be: import idClasses

class ProcessDirector:
    def __init__(self):
        self.allClasses = []

    def construct(self, builderName):
        targetClass = getattr(idClasses, builderName)
        instance = targetClass()
        self.allClasses.append(instance)

IDS = ["ID12345", "ID01234"]

director = ProcessDirector()
for id in IDS:
    director.construct(id)

print director.allClasses
# [<__main__.ID12345 instance at 0x7d850>, <__main__.ID01234 instance at 0x7d918>]
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>If you wanted to avoid an eval ( ) , you could just do : </p>
<pre><code>id = "1234asdf"
constructor = globals()[id]
instance = constructor()
</code></pre>
<p>Provided that the class is defined in ( or imported into ) your current scope . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Simplest way is to just create a dict . </p>
<pre><code>class A(object): 
    pass
class B(object): 
    pass

namedclass = {'ID12345': A, 'ID2': A, 'B': B, 'AnotherB': B,  'ID01234': B}
</code></pre>
<p>Then use it ( your code example ) : </p>
<pre><code>IDS = ["ID12345", "ID01234"]

ProcessDirector = ProcessDirector()
for id in IDS:
    builder = namedclass[id]() 
    ProcessDirector.construct(builder)
    builder.run()
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>There 's some stuff missing from your question , so I 'm forced to guess at the omitted stuff. Feel free to edit your question to correct the omissions . </p>
<pre><code>class ProcessDirector( object ):
    # does something

class ID12345( SomeKindOfProcess ):
    pass

class ID001234( SomeKindOfProcess ):
    pass

idList= [ID12345, ID01234]

theProcessDirector = ProcessDirector()
for id in idList:
  builder = id() #Instantiate an object from the class object
  theProcessDirector.construct(builder)
  builder.run()
</code></pre>
<p>This works very nicely. It does n't instantiate from a string -- in practice you do n't often want this. Sometimes , but rarely. More commonly , you a list of class <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> from which you want <span style="background-color:yellow;">instance</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> . </p>
<p>If you actually are getting your class names from the command line , then you 'd make the following small change . </p>
<pre><code>validClasses = [ ID12345, ID01234 ]
validMap = dict( ( (c.__name__, c) for c in validClasses ) )
nameStrings = [ "ID12345", "ID01234" ] # from your command-line 
idList= [ validMap[s] for s in nameStrings ]
</code></pre>
<p>Everything else remains the same . </p>
<p>[ <span style="background-color:yellow;">Also</span> , if possible , try to start <span style="background-color:yellow;">instance</span> variable names with lowercase letters. Names which start with Uppercase Letters are usually class names. ] </p>
<p>Edit </p>
<p>Removed eval . In spite of the fact that eval ( ) is absolutely not a security hole. Eval ( and exec and execfile ) are only a problem if someone specifically grants access to malicious users . </p>
