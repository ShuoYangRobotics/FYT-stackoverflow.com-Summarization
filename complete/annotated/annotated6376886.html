<h3>Question ( ID-6376886 ) : </h3><h2>What is the best way to create a string array in python ? </h2><p>I 'm relatively new to Python and it 's libraries and I was wondering how I might create a string array with a preset <span style="background-color:yellow;">size.</span> It 's easy in java but I was wondering how I might do this in python . </p>
<p>So far all I can think of is </p>
<pre><code>strs = ['']*size
</code></pre>
<p>And some how when I try to call string methods on it , the debugger gives me an error X operation does not exist in object tuple . </p>
<p>And if it was in java this is what I would want to do . </p>
<pre><code>String[] ar = new String[size];
Arrays.fill(ar,"");
</code></pre>
<p>Please help . </p>
<p>Error code </p>
<pre><code>    strs[sum-1] = strs[sum-1].strip('\(\)')
AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'strip'
</code></pre>
<p>Question : How might I do what I can normally do in Java in Python while still keeping the code clean . </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-6 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>The simple answer is , " You do n't. " At the point where you need something to be of fixed length , you 're either stuck on old habits or writing for a very specific problem with its own unique set of constraints . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>In Python , the tendency is usually that one would use a non-fixed <span style="background-color:yellow;">size</span> list ( that is to say items can be <span style="background-color:yellow;">appended/removed</span> to it dynamically ) . If you followed this , there would be no need to allocate a fixed-size collection ahead of time and <span style="background-color:yellow;">fill</span> it in with empty values. Rather , as you get or create strings , you simply add them to the list. When it comes time to remove values , you simply remove the appropriate value from the string. I would imagine you can probably use this technique for this. For example ( in Python 2.x syntax ) : </p>
<pre><code>>>> temp_list = []
>>> print temp_list
[]
>>> 
>>> temp_list.append("one")
>>> temp_list.append("two")
>>> print temp_list
['one', 'two']
>>> 
>>> temp_list.append("three")
>>> print temp_list
['one', 'two', 'three']
>>> 
</code></pre>
<p>Of course , some situations might call for something more specific. In your case , a good idea may be to use a deque. Check out the post here : Python , forcing a list to a fixed <span style="background-color:yellow;">size</span> . With this , you can create a deque which has a fixed <span style="background-color:yellow;">size.</span> If a new value is <span style="background-color:yellow;">appended</span> to the end , the first element ( head of the deque ) is removed and the new item is <span style="background-color:yellow;">appended</span> onto the deque. This may work for what you need , but I do n't believe this is considered the " norm " for Python . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>But what is a reason to use fixed <span style="background-color:yellow;">size</span> ? There is no actual need in python to use fixed <span style="background-color:yellow;">size</span> arrays ( lists ) so you always have ability to increase it 's <span style="background-color:yellow;">size</span> using <span style="background-color:yellow;">append</span> , extend or decrease using pop , or at least you can use slicing . </p>
<pre><code>x = [''  for x in xrange(10)]
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>In python , you would n't normally do what you are trying to do. But , the below code will do it : </p>
<pre><code>strs = ["" for x in range(size)]
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Are you trying to do something like this ? </p>
<pre><code>>>> strs = [s.strip('\(\)') for s in ['some\\', '(list)', 'of', 'strings']]
>>> strs 
['some', 'list', 'of', 'strings']
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>The error message says it all : strs [ sum-1 ] is a tuple , not a string. If you show more of your code someone will probably be able to help you. Without that we can only guess . </p>
