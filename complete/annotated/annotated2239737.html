<h3>Question ( ID-2239737 ) : </h3><h2>Is it better to use " is " or " = = " for number comparison in Python ? </h2><p>Is it better to use the " is " operator or the " = = " operator to compare two numbers in Python ? </p>
<p>Examples : </p>
<pre><code>>>> a = 1
>>> a is 1
True
>>> a == 1
True
>>> a is 0
False
>>> a == 0
False
</code></pre>

<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>Others have answered your question , but I 'll go into a little bit more detail : </p>
<p>Python 's is compares identity - it asks the question " is this one thing exactly identical to this other thing " ( similar to = = = in JavaScript/PHP and = = in Java ) . So , there are some times when using is makes sense - the most common one being checking for None . Eg , foo is None . But , in general , it is n't what you want . </p>
<p>= = , on the other hand , asks the question " is this one thing logically equivalent to this other thing " . For example : </p>
<pre><code>>>> [1, 2, 3] == [1, 2, 3]
True
>>> [1, 2, 3] is [1, 2, 3]
False
</code></pre>
<p>And this is true because classes can define the method they use to test for equality : </p>
<pre><code>>>> class AlwaysEqual(object):
...     def __eq__(self, other):
...         return True
...
>>> always_equal = AlwaysEqual()
>>> always_equal == 42
True
>>> always_equal == None
True
</code></pre>
<p>But they can not define the method used for testing identity ( ie , they ca n't override is ) . </p>
<br /><b># <span style="background-color:yellow;">2</span> </b><br /><pre><code>>>> a = 255556
>>> a == 255556
True
>>> a is 255556
False
</code></pre>
<p>I think that should answer it ; - ) </p>
<p>The reason is that some often-used <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> , such as the booleans True and False , all 1-letter strings and short numbers are allocated once by the interpreter , and each variable containing that <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> refers to it. Other numbers and larger strings are allocated on demand. The <span style="background-color:yellow;">255556</span> for instance is allocated three times , every time a different <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> is created. And therefore , according to is , they are not the same . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>That will only work for small numbers and I 'm guessing it 's also implementation-dependent. Python uses the same <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> instance for small numbers ( iirc &lt ; <span style="background-color:yellow;">256</span> ) , but this changes for bigger numbers . </p>
<pre><code>>>> a = 2104214124
>>> b = 2104214124
>>> a == b
True
>>> a is b
False
</code></pre>
<p>So you should always use = = to compare numbers . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>= = is what you want , " is " just happens to work on your examples . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><pre><code>>>> 2 == 2.0
True
>>> 2 is 2.0
False
</code></pre>
<p>Use = = </p>
