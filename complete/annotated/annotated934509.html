<h3>Question ( ID-934509 ) : </h3><h2>Java equivalent of function mapping in Python </h2><p>In python , if I have a few functions that I would like to call based on an input , i can do this : </p>
<pre><code>lookup = {'function1':function1, 'function2':function2, 'function3':function3}
lookup[input]()
</code></pre>
<p>That is I have a dictionary of function name mapped to the function , and call the function by a dictionary lookup . </p>
<p>How to do this in java ? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-7 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>Java does n't have first-class methods , so the command pattern is your friend.. . </p>
<p>disclamer : code not tested ! </p>
<pre><code>public interface Command 
{
    void invoke();
}

Map<String, Command> commands = new HashMap<String, Command>();
commands.put("function1", new Command() 
{
    public void invoke() { System.out.println("hello world"); }
});

commands.get("function1").invoke();
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>You could use a Map&lt ; String,Method&gt ; or Map&lt ; String,Callable&gt ; etc,and then use map.get ( " function1 " ) .invoke ( ... ) . But usually these kinds of problems are tackled more cleanly by using polymorphism instead of a lookup . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>There are several ways to approach this problem. Most of these were posted already : </p>
<ul>Commands - Keep a bunch of objects that have an execute ( ) or invoke ( ) method in a map ; lookup the command by name , then invoke the method . Polymorphism - More generally than <span style="background-color:yellow;">commands</span> , you can invoke methods on any related set of objects . Finally there is Reflection - You can use reflection to <span style="background-color:yellow;">get</span> references to java.lang.Method objects. For a set of known classes/methods , this works fairly well and there is n't too much overhead once you load the Method objects. You could use this to , for example , allow a user to type java code into a command line , which you execute in real time . </ul>
<p>Personally I would use the Command approach. Commands combine well with Template Methods , allowing you to enforce certain patterns on all your command objects. Example : </p>
<pre><code>public abstract class Command {
  public final Object execute(Map<String, Object> args) {
    // do permission checking here or transaction management
    Object retval = doExecute(args);
    // do logging, cleanup, caching, etc here
    return retval;
  }
  // subclasses override this to do the real work
  protected abstract Object doExecute(Map<String, Object> args);
}
</code></pre>
<p>I would resort to reflection only when you need to use this kind of mapping for classes whose design you do n't control , and for which it 's not practical to make <span style="background-color:yellow;">commands.</span> For example , you could n't expose the Java API in a command-shell by making <span style="background-color:yellow;">commands</span> for each method . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>Polymorphic example. . </p>
<pre><code>public interface Animal {public void speak();};
public class Dog implements Animal {public void speak(){System.out.println("treat? treat? treat?");}}
public class Cat implements Animal {public void speak(){System.out.println("leave me alone");}}
public class Hamster implements Animal {public void speak(){System.out.println("I run, run, run, but never get anywhere");}}

Map<String,Animal> animals = new HashMap<String,Animal>();
animals.put("dog",new Dog());
animals.put("cat",new Cat());
animals.put("hamster",new Hamster());
for(Animal animal : animals){animal.speak();}

<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>As mentioned in other questions , a Map&lt ; String,MyCommandType&gt ; with anonymous inner classes is one verbose way to do it . </p>
<p>A variation is to use enums in place of the anonymous inner classes. Each constant of the enum can implement/override methods of the enum or implemented interface , much the same as the anonymous inner class technique but with a little less mess. I believe Effective Java 2nd Ed deals with how to initialise a map of enums. To map from the enum name merely requires calling MyEnumType.valueOf ( name ) . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>Unfortunately , Java does not have first-class functions , but consider the following interface : </p>
<pre><code>public interface F<A, B> {
  public B f(A a);
}
</code></pre>
<p>This models the type for functions from type A to type B , as first-class values that you can pass around. What you want is a Map&lt ; String , F&lt ; A , B&gt ; &gt ; . </p>
<p>Functional Java is a fairly complete library centered around first-class functions . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>As everyone else said , Java does n't support functions as first-level objects. To achieve this , you use a Functor , which is a class that wraps a function. Steve Yegge has a nice rant about that . </p>
<p>To help you with this limitation , people write functor libraries : jga , Commons Functor </p>
