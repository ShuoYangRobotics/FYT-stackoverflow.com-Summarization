<h3>Question ( ID-2212933 ) : </h3><h2>Python <span style="background-color:yellow;">regex</span> for <span style="background-color:yellow;">reading</span> CSV-like rows </h2><p>I want to parse incoming CSV-like rows of data. Values are separated with commas ( and there could be leading and trailing whitespaces around commas ) , and can be quoted either with ' or with " . For example - this is a valid row : </p>
<pre><code>    data1, data2  ,"data3'''",  'data4""',,,data5,
</code></pre>
<p>but this one is malformed : </p>
<pre><code>    data1, data2, da"ta3", 'data4',
</code></pre>
<p>-- quotation marks can only be prepended or trailed by spaces . </p>
<p>Such malformed rows should be <span style="background-color:yellow;">recognized</span> - best would be to somehow mark malformed value within row , but if <span style="background-color:yellow;">regex</span> does n't match the whole row then it 's also acceptable . </p>
<p>I 'm trying to write <span style="background-color:yellow;">regex</span> able to parse this , using either match ( ) of findall ( ) , but every single <span style="background-color:yellow;">regex</span> I 'm coming with has some problems with edge cases . </p>
<p>So , maybe someone with experience in parsing something similar could help me on this ? ( Or maybe this is too complex for <span style="background-color:yellow;">regex</span> and I should just write a function ) </p>
<p>EDIT1 : </p>
<p><span style="background-color:yellow;">csv</span> module is not much of use here : </p>
<pre><code>    >>> list(csv.reader(StringIO('''2, "dat,a1", 'dat,a2',''')))
    [['2', ' "dat', 'a1"', " 'dat", "a2'", '']]

    >>> list(csv.reader(StringIO('''2,"dat,a1",'dat,a2',''')))
    [['2', 'dat,a1', "'dat", "a2'", '']]
</code></pre>
<p>-- unless this can be tuned ? </p>
<p>EDIT2 : A few language edits - I hope it 's more valid English now </p>
<p>EDIT3 : Thank you for all answers , I 'm now pretty sure that <span style="background-color:yellow;">regular</span> expression is not that good idea here as ( 1 ) covering all edge cases can be tricky ( 2 ) writer output is not <span style="background-color:yellow;">regular.</span> Writing that , I 've decided to check mentioned pyparsing and either use it , or write custom FSM-like parser . </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-6 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>Although it would likely be possible with some combination of pre-processing , use of <span style="background-color:yellow;">csv</span> module , post-processing , and use of <span style="background-color:yellow;">regular</span> expressions , your stated <span style="background-color:yellow;">requirements</span> do not fit well with the design of the <span style="background-color:yellow;">csv</span> module , nor possibly with <span style="background-color:yellow;">regular</span> expressions ( depending on the complexity of nested quotation marks that you might have to handle ) . </p>
<p>In complex parsing cases , pyparsing is always a good package to fall back on. If this is n't a one-off situation , it will likely produce the most straightforward and maintainable <span style="background-color:yellow;">result</span> , at the cost of possibly a little extra effort up front. Consider that investment to be paid back quickly , however , as you save yourself the extra effort of debugging the <span style="background-color:yellow;">regex</span> solutions to handle corner cases.. . </p>
<p>You can likely find examples of pyparsing-based CSV parsing easily , with this question maybe enough to get you started . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>Python has a standard library module to <span style="background-color:yellow;">read</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">csv</span> files : </p>
<pre><code>import csv

reader = csv.reader(open('file.csv'))

for line in reader:
    print line
</code></pre>
<p>For your example input this prints </p>
<pre><code>['data1', ' data2 ', "data3'''", ' \'data4""\'', '', '', 'data5', '']
</code></pre>
<p>EDIT : </p>
<p>you need to add skipinitalspace = True to allow spaces before double quotation marks for the extra examples you provided. Not sure about the single quotes yet . </p>
<pre><code>>>> list(csv.reader(StringIO('''2, "dat,a1", 'dat,a2','''), skipinitialspace=True))
[['2', 'dat,a1', "'dat", "a2'", '']]

>>> list(csv.reader(StringIO('''2,"dat,a1",'dat,a2','''), skipinitialspace=True))
[['2', 'dat,a1', "'dat", "a2'", '']]

<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>While the <span style="background-color:yellow;">csv</span> module is the right answer here , a <span style="background-color:yellow;">regex</span> that could do this is quite doable : </p>
<pre><code>import re

r = re.compile(r'''
    \s*                # Any whitespace.
    (                  # Start capturing here.
      [^,"']+?         # Either a series of non-comma non-quote characters.
      |                # OR
      "(?:             # A double-quote followed by a string of characters...
          [^"\\]|\\.   # That are either non-quotes or escaped...
       )*              # ...repeated any number of times.
      "                # Followed by a closing double-quote.
      |                # OR
      '(?:[^'\\]|\\.)*'# Same as above, for single quotes.
    )                  # Done capturing.
    \s*                # Allow arbitrary space before the comma.
    (?:,|$)            # Followed by a comma or the end of a string.
    ''', re.VERBOSE)

line = r"""data1, data2  ,"data3'''",  'data4""',,,data5,"""

print r.findall(line)

# That prints: ['data1', 'data2', '"data3\'\'\'"', '\'data4""\'', 'data5']

<p>EDIT : To validate <span style="background-color:yellow;">lines</span> , you can <span style="background-color:yellow;">reuse</span> the <span style="background-color:yellow;">regex</span> above with small additions : </p>
<pre><code>import re

r_validation = re.compile(r'''
    ^(?:    # Capture from the start.
      # Below is the same regex as above, but condensed.
      # One tiny modification is that it allows empty values
      # The first plus is replaced by an asterisk.
      \s*([^,"']*?|"(?:[^"\\]|\\.)*"|'(?:[^'\\]|\\.)*')\s*(?:,|$)
    )*$    # And don't stop until the end.
    ''', re.VERBOSE)

line1 = r"""data1, data2  ,"data3'''",  'data4""',,,data5,"""
line2 = r"""data1, data2, da"ta3", 'data4',"""

if r_validation.match(line1):
    print 'Line 1 is valid.'
else:
    print 'Line 1 is INvalid.'

if r_validation.match(line2):
    print 'Line 2 is valid.'
else:
    print 'Line 2 is INvalid.'

# Prints:
#    Line 1 is valid.
#    Line 2 is INvalid.

<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>It is not possible to give you an answer , because you have not completely specified the protocol that is being used by the writer . </p>
<p>It evidently contains rules like : </p>
<p>If a field contains any commas or single quotes , quote it with double quotes . Else if the field contains any double quotes , quote it with single quotes . Note : the <span style="background-color:yellow;">result</span> is still valid if you swap double and single in the above 2 clauses . Else do n't quote it . The <span style="background-color:yellow;">resultant</span> field may have spaces ( or other whitespace ? ) prepended or appended . The so-augmented fields are assembled into a row , separated by commas and terminated by the platform 's newline ( LF or CRLF ) . </p>
<p>What is not mentioned is what the writer does in these cases : ( 0 ) field contains BOTH single quotes and double quotes ( 1 ) field contains leading non-newline whitespace ( 2 ) field contains trailing non-newline whitespace ( 3 ) field contains any newlines . Where the writer ignores any of these cases , please specify what outcomes you want . </p>
<p>You also mention " quotation marks can only be prepended or trailed by spaces " -- surely you mean commas are allowed also , otherwise your example <span style="background-color:yellow;">'data4</span> " " ',,,data5 , fails on the first comma . </p>
<p>How is your data encoded ? </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>This probably sounds too simple , but <span style="background-color:yellow;">really</span> from the looks of things you are looking for a string that contains either [ a-zA-Z0-9 ] [ " ' ] + [ a-zA-Z0-9 ] , I mean without in depth testing against the data <span style="background-color:yellow;">really</span> what you 're looking for is a quote or double quote ( or any combination ) in between letters ( you could also add numbers there ) . </p>
<p>Based on what you were asking , it <span style="background-color:yellow;">really</span> does n't matter that it 's a CSV , it matter 's that you have data that does n't conform. Which I believe just doing a search for a letter , then any combination of one or more " or ' and another letter . </p>
<p>Now are you looking to get a " quantity " or just a printout of the <span style="background-color:yellow;">line</span> that contains it so you know which ones to go back and fix ? </p>
<p>I 'm sorry I do n't know python <span style="background-color:yellow;">regex</span> 's but in perl this would look something like this : </p>
<pre><code># Look for one or more letter/number at least one ' or " or more and at least one    
#  or more letter/number
if ($line =~ m/[a-zA-Z0-9]+['"]+[a-zA-Z0-9]+/ig)
{
    # Prints the line if the above regex is found
    print $line;

}
</code></pre>
<p>Just simply convert that for when you look at a <span style="background-color:yellow;">line</span> . </p>
<p>I 'm sorry if I misunderstood the question </p>
<p>I hope it helps ! </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>If your goal is to convert the data to XML ( or JSON , or YAML ) , look at this example for a <span style="background-color:yellow;">Gelatin</span> syntax that produces the following output : </p>
<pre><code><xml>
  <line>
    <column>data1</column>
    <column>data2  </column>
    <column>data3'''</column>
    <column>data4""</column>
    <column/>
    <column/>
    <column>data5</column>
    <column/>
  </line>
</xml>
</code></pre>
<p>Note that <span style="background-color:yellow;">Gelatin</span> also has a Python API : </p>
<pre><code>from Gelatin.util import compile, generate_to_file
syntax = compile('syntax.gel')
generate_to_file(syntax, 'input.csv', 'output.xml', 'xml')
