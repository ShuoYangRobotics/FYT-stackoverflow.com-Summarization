<h3>Question ( ID-2640806 ) : </h3><h2>JavaScript-like Object in Python standard library ? </h2><p>Quite often , I find myself wanting a simple , " dump " <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> in Python which behaves like a JavaScript <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> ( ie , its members can be accessed either with .member or with [ 'member ' ] ) . </p>
<p>Usually I 'll just stick this at the top of the .py : </p>
<pre><code>class DumbObject(dict):
    def __getattr__(self, attr):
        return self[attr]
    def __stattr__(self, attr, value):
        self[attr] = value
</code></pre>
<p>But that 's kind of lame , and there is at least one bug with that implementation ( although I ca n't remember what it is ) . </p>
<p>So , is there something similar in the standard library ? </p>
<p>And , for the record , simply instanciating <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">does</span> n't work : </p>
<pre>
>>> obj = object()
>>> obj.airspeed = 42
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "", line 1, in 
AttributeError: 'object' object has no attribute 'airspeed'
</pre>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: (dang, should have seen this one coming)â€Ś Don't worry! I'm not trying to write JavaScript in Python. The place I most often find I want this is while I'm still experimenting: I have a collection of "stuff" that doesn't quite feel right to put in a dictionary, but also doesn't feel right to have its own class.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-6 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>There is no " standard library " with that kind of <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> , but on ActiveState there is a quite well-known recipe from Alex Martelli , called " bunch " . </p>
<p>Note : there 's also a package available on pypi called bunch and that should <span style="background-color:yellow;">do</span> about the same thing , but I <span style="background-color:yellow;">do</span> not know anything about its implementation and quality . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>You can try with <span style="background-color:yellow;">attrdict</span> : </p>
<pre><code>class attrdict(dict):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        dict.__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)
        self.__dict__ = self

a = attrdict(x=1, y=2)
print a.x, a.y
print a['x'], a['y']

b = attrdict()
b.x, b.y  = 1, 2
print b.x, b.y
print b['x'], b['y']
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>You may be interested in collections.namedtuple </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>I 'm not a big fan of that , because you get into the " what if you define 'keys ' " : </p>
<pre><code>foo = DumbObject()
foo.moshe = 'here'
foo.keys # --> gives a callable, if you'll call it you'll get ['moshe']
foo.keys = 'front-door'
foo.keys # --> oh look, now it's a string 'front-door'
</code></pre>
<p>Is " keys " supposed to be a defined method on your <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> , or is that just happenstance ? If it is , then you better define <span style="background-color:yellow;">DumbObject</span> as </p>
<pre><code>class DumbObject(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self._dict = {}
    def __getitem__(self, key):
        return self._dict[key]
    __getattr__ = __getitem__
    # Ditto for set
def asDictionary(do):
    return do._dict
</code></pre>
<p>But why are you <span style="background-color:yellow;">doing</span> it ? Are you sure that this is the right answer ? Perhaps you should be using the right type of <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> ? </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>If I understand you correctly , you want an <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> where you can just dump attributes. If I am correct , all you would have to <span style="background-color:yellow;">do</span> is create an empty class. For example : </p>
<pre><code>>>> class DumpObject: pass
... 
>>>#example of usage:
...
>>> a = DumpObject()
>>> a.airspeed = 420
>>> print a.airspeed
420
</code></pre>
<p>That 's it </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>You seem to be wanting to write JavaScript in Python , and that is as bad as writing Python in JavaScript , and nearly as bad as writing COBOL in Java . </p>
<p>That being said , it really depends on what you are trying to achieve. If what you want is to create an <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> from an iterable , you might be interested on the Named Tuple class . </p>
<p>Else , if you really need this functionality , you can use moshez ' <span style="background-color:yellow;">DumbObject</span> , but as he said , you might be approaching this in a less than optimum way . </p>
<p>Python is not JavaScript , just as Python is not Java . </p>
