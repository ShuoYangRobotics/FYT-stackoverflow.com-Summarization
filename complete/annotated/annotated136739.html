<h3>Question ( ID-136739 ) : </h3><h2>Python language API </h2><p>I 'm starting with Python coming from java . </p>
<p>I was wondering if there exists something similar to JavaDoc API where I can find the class , its methods and and example of how to use it . </p>
<p>I 've found very helpul to use help ( thing ) from the Python ( command line ) </p>
<p>I have found this also : </p>
<p>http : //docs.python.org/ </p>
<p>http : //docs.python.org/modindex.html </p>
<p>But it seems to help when you already the class name you are looking for. In JavaDoc API I have all the classes so if I need something I scroll down to a class that " sounds like " what I need. Or some times I just browse all the classes to see what they do , and when I need a feature my brain recalls me We saw something similar in the javadoc remember ! ? </p>
<p>But I do n't seem to find the similar in Python ( yet ) and that why I 'm posting this questin . </p>
<p>BTW I know that I would eventually will read this : </p>
<p>http : //docs.python.org/lib/lib.html </p>
<p>But , well , I think it is not today . </p>

<p>I 'm not sure if you 're looking for something more sophisticated , but it does the trick . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>The standard python library is fairly well documented. Try jumping into python and importing a module say " <span style="background-color:yellow;">os</span> " and running : </p>
<pre><code>import os   
help(os)
</code></pre>
<p>This reads the doc strings on each of the items in the module and displays it. This is exactly what pydoc will do too . </p>
<p>EDIT : epydoc is probably exactly what you 're looking for : </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>Here is a list of all the modules in python , not sure if that 's what you 're really after . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>I 've downloaded Python 2.5 from Python.org and It does not contains pydoc . </p>

<p>But it has ( the substitute I guess ) pydocgui.. . </p>

<p>This launches a webserver and shows what I was looking for. All the modules plus all the classes that come with the platform . </p>
<p>The Doc dir contains the same as in : </p>
<p>http : //docs.python.org/ </p>
<p>Thanks a lot for guide me to pydoc . </p>

<p>I suggest that you 're making a mistake. The lib doc has " the class , its methods and and example of how to use it. " It is what you are looking for . </p>
<p>I use both Java and Python all the time. Dig into the library doc , you 'll find everything you 're looking for . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>If you 're working on Windows ActiveState Python comes with the documentation , including the library reference in a searchable help file . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>It does n't directly answer your question ( so I 'll probably be downgraded ) , but you may be interested in Jython . </p>
<blockquote>Jython is an implementation of the high-level , dynamic , object-oriented language Python written in 100 % Pure Java , and seamlessly integrated with the Java platform. It thus allows you to run Python on any Java platform . </blockquote>
<p>Since you are coming from Java , Jython may help you leverage Python while still allowing you to use your Java knowledge . </p>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>You can set the environment variable PYTHONDOCS to point to where the python documentation is installed . </p>
<p>On my system , it 's in /usr/share/doc/python2.5 </p>
<p>So you can define this variable in your shell profile or somewhere else depending on your system : </p>
<blockquote>export PYTHONDOCS = /usr/share/doc/python2.5 </blockquote>
<p>Now , if you open an interractive python console , you can call the help system. For exemple : </p>
<blockquote>&gt ; &gt ; &gt ; help ( Exception ) &gt ; &gt ; &gt ; Help on class Exception in module exceptions : &gt ; &gt ; &gt ; class Exception ( BaseException ) &gt ; &gt ; &gt ; | Common base class for all non-exit exceptions . &gt ; &gt ; &gt ; | &gt ; &gt ; &gt ; | Method resolution order : &gt ; &gt ; &gt ; | Exception </blockquote>
<p>Documentation is here : </p>
<p>http : //docs.python.org/lib/module-pydoc.html </p>
<br /><b># 8 </b><br /><p>Also try </p>
<pre><code>pydoc -p 11111
</code></pre>
<p>Then type in web browser http : //localhost : 11111 </p>
<p>EDIT : of course you can use any other value for port number instead of 11111 </p>
