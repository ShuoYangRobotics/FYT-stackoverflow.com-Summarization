<h3>Question ( ID-396913 ) : </h3><h2>In Python , how do I find the <span style="background-color:yellow;">date</span> of the first Monday of a given week ? </h2><p>If I have a certain week number ( eg 51 ) and a given year ( eg 2008 ) , how do I find the <span style="background-color:yellow;">date</span> of the first Monday of that same week ? </p>
<p>Many thanks </p>

>>> time.asctime(time.strptime('2008 50 1', '%Y %W %w'))
'Mon Dec 15 00:00:00 2008'
</code></pre>
<p>Assuming the first day of your week is Monday , use % U instead of % W if the first day of your week is Sunday. See the documentation for <span style="background-color:yellow;">strptime</span> for details . </p>
<p>Update : Fixed week number. The % W directive is 0-based so week 51 would be entered as 50 , not 51 . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>Week 51 of 2008 started with Monday December 15 : </p>
<pre><code>>>> d = date(2008, 1, 1)
>>> d + timedelta(days=-d.weekday(), weeks=50)
datetime.date(2008, 12, 15)
</code></pre>
<p>Week 1 of 2009 started on December 29 : </p>
<pre><code>>>> d = date(2009, 1, 1)
>>> d + timedelta(days=-d.weekday(), weeks=0)
datetime.date(2008, 12, 29)
</code></pre>
<p>Found a web calendar that shows week numbers . And then there 's always vecka.nu ( Vecka means week in Swedish , nu means now. ) </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>PEZ 's and Gerald Kaszuba 's solutions work under assumption that January 1st will always be in the first week of a given year. This assumption is not correct for ISO calendar , see Python 's docs for reference. For example , in ISO calendar , week 1 of 2010 actually starts on Jan 4 , and Jan 1 of 2010 is in week 53 of 2009. An ISO calendar-compatible solution : </p>
<pre><code>from datetime import date, timedelta

def week_start_date(year, week):
    d = date(year, 1, 1)    
    delta_days = d.isoweekday() - 1
    delta_weeks = week
    if year == d.isocalendar()[0]:
        delta_weeks -= 1
    delta = timedelta(days=-delta_days, weeks=delta_weeks)
    return d + delta
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>This seems to work , assuming week one can have a Monday falling on a day in the last year . </p>
<pre><code>from datetime import date, timedelta

def get_first_dow(year, week):
    d = date(year, 1, 1)
    d = d - timedelta(d.weekday())
    dlt = timedelta(days = (week - 1) * 7)
    return d + dlt
</code></pre>

<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><pre><code>from datetime import date, timedelta

<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>I have slightly modified the script of Vaidas K. in a way that it will return the beginning of the week and the end day of the week . </p>
<pre><code>from datetime import datetime, date, timedelta

def weekbegend(year, week):
    """
    Calcul du premier et du dernier jour de la semaine ISO
    """
    d = date(year, 1, 1)    
    delta_days = d.isoweekday() - 1
    delta_weeks = week
    if year == d.isocalendar()[0]:
        delta_weeks -= 1
    # delta for the beginning of the week
    delta = timedelta(days=-delta_days, weeks=delta_weeks)
    weekbeg = d + delta
    # delta2 for the end of the week
    delta2 = timedelta(days=6-delta_days, weeks=delta_weeks)
    weekend = d + delta2
    return weekbeg, weekend
</code></pre>
<p>Soyou can use it that way . </p>
<pre><code>weekbeg, weekend = weekbegend(2009, 1)
begweek = weekbeg.strftime("%A %d %B %Y")
endweek = weekend.strftime("%A %d %B %Y")

<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>Use the string formatting found in the <span style="background-color:yellow;">time</span> module. Detailed explanation of the formats used </p>
<pre><code>>>> import time
>>> time.strptime("51 08 1","%U %y %w")
(2008, 12, 22, 0, 0, 0, 0, 357, -1)
</code></pre>
<p>The <span style="background-color:yellow;">date</span> returned is off by one week according to the calendar on my computer , maybe that is because weeks are indexed from 0 ? </p>
<br /><b># 8 </b><br /><p>Look at the documentation here </p>
<p>The rest is up to you . </p>
