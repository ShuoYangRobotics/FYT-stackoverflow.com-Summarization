<h3>Question ( ID-260056 ) : </h3><h2>Hashtable/dictionary/map lookup with regular expressions </h2><p>I 'm trying to figure out if there 's a reasonably efficient way to perform a lookup in a <span style="background-color:yellow;">dictionary</span> ( or a hash , or a map , or whatever your favorite language calls it ) where the keys are regular expressions and strings are looked up against the set of keys. For example ( in Python syntax ) : </p>
<pre><code>>>> regex_dict = { re.compile(r'foo.') : 12, re.compile(r'^FileN.*$') : 35 }
>>> regex_dict['food']
12
>>> regex_dict['foot in my mouth']
12
>>> regex_dict['FileNotFoundException: file.x does not exist']
35
</code></pre>
<p>( Obviously the above example wo n't work as written in Python , but that 's the sort of thing I 'd like to be able to do. ) </p>
<p>I can think of a naive way to implement this , in which I iterate over all of the keys in the <span style="background-color:yellow;">dictionary</span> and try to match the passed in string against them , but then I lose the O ( 1 ) lookup time of a hash map and instead have O ( n ) , where n is the number of keys in my <span style="background-color:yellow;">dictionary.</span> This is potentially a big deal , as I expect this <span style="background-color:yellow;">dictionary</span> to grow very large , and I will need to search it over and over again ( actually I 'll need to iterate over it for every line I read in a text file , and the files can be hundreds of megabytes in size ) . </p>
<p>Is there a way to accomplish this , without resorting to O ( n ) efficiency ? </p>
<p>Alternatively , if you know of a way to accomplish this sort of a lookup in a database , that would be great , too . </p>
<p>( Any programming language is fine -- I 'm using Python , but I 'm more interested in the data structures and algorithms here. ) </p>
<p>Someone pointed out that more than one match is possible , and that 's absolutely correct. Ideally in this situation I 'd like to return a list or tuple containing all of the matches. I 'd settle for the first match , though . </p>
<p>I ca n't see O ( 1 ) being possible in that scenario ; I 'd settle for anything less than O ( n ) , though. Also , the underlying data structure could be anything , but the basic behavior I 'd like is what I 've written above : lookup a string , and return the value ( s ) that match the regular expression keys . </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-16 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>This is not possible to do with a regular hash table in any language. You 'll either have to iterate through the entire keyset , attempting to match the key to your <span style="background-color:yellow;">regex</span> , or use a different data structure . </p>
<p>You should choose a data structure that is appropriate to the problem you 're trying to solve. If you have to match against any arbitrary regular expression , I do n't know of a good solution. If the class of regular expressions you 'll be using is more restrictive , you might be able to use a data structure such as a trie or suffix tree . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>In the general case , what you need is a lexer generator. It takes a bunch of regular expressions and compiles them into a recognizer. " lex " will work if you are using C. I have never used a lexer generator in Python , but there seem to be a few to choose from. Google shows PLY , PyGgy and PyLexer . </p>
<p>If the regular expressions all resemble each other in some way , then you may be able to take some shortcuts. We would need to know more about the ultimate problem that you are trying to solve in order to come up with any suggestions. Can you share some sample regular expressions and some sample data ? </p>
<p>Also , how many regular expressions are you dealing with here ? Are you sure that the naive approach wo n't work ? As Rob Pike once said , " Fancy algorithms are slow when n is small , and n is usually small. " Unless you have thousands of regular expressions , and thousands of things to match against them , and this is an interactive application where a user is waiting for you , you may be best off just doing it the easy way and looping through the regular expressions . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>This is definitely possible , as long as you 're using 'real ' regular expressions. A textbook regular expression is something that can be recognized by a deterministic finite state machine , which primarily means you ca n't have back-references in there . </p>
<p>There 's a property of regular languages that " the union of two regular languages is regular " , meaning that you can recognize an arbitrary number of regular expressions at once with a single state machine. The state machine runs in O ( 1 ) time with respect to the number of expressions ( it runs in O ( n ) time with respect to the length of the input string , but hash tables do too ) . </p>
<p>Once the state machine completes you 'll know which expressions matched , and from there it 's easy to look up values in O ( 1 ) time . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>What happens if you have a <span style="background-color:yellow;">dictionary</span> such as </p>
<pre><code>regex_dict = { re.compile("foo.*"): 5, re.compile("f.*"): 6 }
</code></pre>
<p>In this case <span style="background-color:yellow;">regex_dict</span> [ " food " ] could legitimately return either 5 or 6 . </p>
<p>Even ignoring that problem , there 's probably no way to do this efficiently with the <span style="background-color:yellow;">regex</span> module. Instead , what you 'd need is an internal directed graph or tree structure . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>There is a Perl module that does just this Tie : : Hash : : Regex . </p>
<pre><code>use Tie::Hash::Regex;
my %h;

tie %h, 'Tie::Hash::Regex';

$h{key}   = 'value';
$h{key2}  = 'another value';
$h{stuff} = 'something else';

print $h{key};  # prints 'value'
print $h{2};    # prints 'another value'
print $h{'^s'}; # prints 'something else'

print tied(%h)->FETCH(k); # prints 'value' and 'another value'

delete $h{k};   # deletes $h{key} and $h{key2};
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>As other respondents have pointed out , it 's not possible to do this with a hash table in constant time . </p>
<p>One approximation that might help is to use a technique called " n-grams " . Create an inverted index from n-character chunks of a word to the entire word. When given a pattern , split it into n-character chunks , and use the index to compute a scored list of matching words . </p>
<p>Even if you ca n't accept an approximation , in most cases this would still provide an accurate filtering mechanism so that you do n't have to apply the <span style="background-color:yellow;">regex</span> to every key . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>A special case of this problem came up in the 70s AI languages oriented around deductive databases. The keys in these databases could be patterns with variables -- like regular expressions without the * or | operators. They tended to use fancy extensions of trie structures for indexes. See krep * .lisp in Norvig 's Paradigms of AI Programming for the general idea . </p>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>If you have a small set of possible inputs , you can cache the matches as they appear in a second <span style="background-color:yellow;">dict</span> and get O ( 1 ) for the cached values . </p>
<p>If the set of possible inputs is too big to cache but not infinite , either , you can just keep the last N matches in the cache ( check Google for " LRU maps " - least recently used ) . </p>
<p>If you ca n't do this , you can try to chop down the number of <span style="background-color:yellow;">regexps</span> you have to try by checking a prefix or somesuch . </p>
<br /><b># 8 </b><br /><p>What you want to do is very similar to what is supported by xrdb. They only support a fairly minimal notion of globbing however . </p>
<p>Internally you can implement a larger family of regular languages than theirs by storing your regular expressions as a character trie . </p>
<ul>single characters just become trie nodes . . 's become wildcard insertions covering all children of the current trie node . * 's become back links in the trie to node at the start of the previous item . [ a-z ] ranges insert the same subsequent child nodes repeatedly under each of the characters in the range. With care , while inserts/updates may be somewhat expensive the search can be linear in the size of the string. With some placeholder stuff the common combinatorial explosion cases can be kept under control . ( foo ) | ( bar ) nodes become multiple insertions </ul>
<p>This does n't handle <span style="background-color:yellow;">regexes</span> that occur at arbitrary points in the string , but that can be modeled by wrapping your <span style="background-color:yellow;">regex</span> with . * on either side . </p>
<p>Perl has a couple of Text : : Trie -like modules you can raid for ideas. ( Heck I think I even wrote one of them way back when ) </p>
<br /><b># 9 </b><br /><p>I created this exact data structure for a project once. I implemented it naively , as you suggested. I did make two immensely helpful optimizations , which may or may not be feasible for you , depending on the size of your data : </p>
<ul>Memoizing the hash lookups Pre-seeding the the memoization table ( not sure what to call this... warming up the cache ? ) </ul>
<p>To avoid the problem of multiple keys matching the input , I gave each <span style="background-color:yellow;">regex</span> key a priority and the highest priority was used . </p>
<br /><b># 10 </b><br /><p>What about the following : </p>
<pre><code>class redict(dict):
def __init__(self, d):
	dict.__init__(self, d)

def __getitem__(self, regex):
	r = re.compile(regex)
	mkeys = filter(r.match, self.keys())
	for i in mkeys:
		yield dict.__getitem__(self, i)
</code></pre>
<p>It 's basically a subclass of the <span style="background-color:yellow;">dict</span> type in Python. With this you can supply a regular expression as a key , and the values of all keys that match this <span style="background-color:yellow;">regex</span> are returned in an iterable fashion using yield . </p>
<p>With this you can do the following : </p>
<pre><code>>>> keys = ["a", "b", "c", "ab", "ce", "de"]
>>> vals = range(0,len(keys))
>>> red = redict(zip(keys, vals))
>>> for i in red[r"^.e$"]:
...     print i
...

<br /><b># 11 </b><br /><p>The fundamental assumption is flawed , I think. you ca n't map hashes to regular expressions . </p>
<br /><b># 12 </b><br /><p>I do n't think it 's even theoretically possible. What happens if someone passes in a string that matches more than 1 regular expression . </p>
<p>For example , what would happen if someone did : </p>
<pre><code>>>> regex_dict['FileNfoo']
</code></pre>
<p>How can something like that possibly be O ( 1 ) ? </p>
<br /><b># 13 </b><br /><p>It may be possible to get the <span style="background-color:yellow;">regex</span> compiler to do most of the work for you by concatenating the search expressions into one big <span style="background-color:yellow;">regexp</span> , separated by " | " . A clever <span style="background-color:yellow;">regex</span> compiler might search for commonalities in the alternatives in such a case , and devise a more efficient search strategy than simply checking each one in turn. But I have no idea whether there are compilers which will do that . </p>
<br /><b># 14 </b><br /><p>It really depends on what these <span style="background-color:yellow;">regexes</span> look like. If you do n't have a lot <span style="background-color:yellow;">regexes</span> that will match almost anything like ' . * ' or ' \ d + ' , and instead you have <span style="background-color:yellow;">regexes</span> that contains mostly words and phrases or any fixed patterns longer than 4 characters ( e.g. ' a * b * c ' in ^ \ d + a \ * b \ * c : \ s + \ w + ) , as in your examples. You can do this common trick that scales well to millions of <span style="background-color:yellow;">regexes</span> : </p>
<p>Build a inverted index for the <span style="background-color:yellow;">regexes</span> ( rabin-karp-hash ( 'fixed pattern ' ) -&gt ; list of <span style="background-color:yellow;">regexes</span> containing 'fixed pattern ' ) . Then at matching time , using Rabin-Karp hashing to compute sliding hashes and look up the inverted index , advancing one character at a time. You now have O ( 1 ) look-up for inverted-index non-matches and a reasonable O ( k ) time for matches , k is the average length of the lists of <span style="background-color:yellow;">regexes</span> in the inverted index. k can be quite small ( less than 10 ) for many applications. The quality ( false positive means bigger k , false negative means missed matches ) of the inverted index depends on how well the indexer understands the <span style="background-color:yellow;">regex</span> syntax. If the <span style="background-color:yellow;">regexes</span> are generated by human experts , they can provide hints for contained fixed patterns as well . </p>
<br /><b># 15 </b><br /><p>Ok , I have a very similar requirements , I have a lot of lines of different syntax , basically remark lines and lines with some codes for to use in a process of smart-card format , also , descriptor lines of keys and secret codes , in every case , I think that the " model " pattern/action is the beast approach for to recognize and to process a lot of lines . I 'm using C + + /CLI for to develop my assembly named LanguageProcessor.dll , the core of this library is a lex_rule class that basically contains : </p>
<ul>a Regex member an event member </ul>
<p>The constructor loads the <span style="background-color:yellow;">regex</span> string and call the necessary codes for to build the event on the fly using DynamicMethod , Emit and Reflexion ... also into the assembly exists other class like meta and object that constructs ans instantiates the objects by the simple names of the publisher and the receiver class , receiver class provides the action handlers for each rule matched . </p>
<p>Late , I have a class named fasterlex_engine that build a Dictionary &lt ; Regex , action_delegate&gt ; that load the definitions from an array for to run . </p>
<p>The project is in advanced point but I 'm still building , today. I will try to enhance the performance of running surrounding the sequential access to every pair foreach line input , thru using some mechanism of lookup the <span style="background-color:yellow;">dictionary</span> directly using the <span style="background-color:yellow;">regexp</span> like : </p>
