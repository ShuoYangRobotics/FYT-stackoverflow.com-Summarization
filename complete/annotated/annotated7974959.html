<h3>Question ( ID-7974959 ) : </h3><h2>Python : create dict from list and auto-gen/increment the keys ( list is the actual key values ) ? </h2><p>i 've searched pretty hard and cant find a question that exactly pertains to what i want to. . </p>
<p>I have a file called " words " that has about 1000 <span style="background-color:yellow;">lines</span> of random A-Z sorted words.. . </p>
<pre><code>10th
1st
2nd

<p>I am trying to load this file into a dictionary , where using the word are the key values and the keys are actually auto-gen/auto-incremented for each word </p>
<p>e.g { 0 : 10th , 1 : 1st , 2 : 2nd } ...etc..etc.. . </p>
<p>below is the code i 've hobbled together so far , it seems to sort of works but its only showing me the last entry in the file as the only dict pair element </p>
<pre><code>f3data = open('words')

mydict = {}

for line in f3data:
    print line.strip()
    cmyline = line.split()
    key = +1
    mydict [key] = cmyline

print mydict

<p>+ 1 is the same thing as 1 . I assume you meant key + = 1 . I also ca n't see a reason why you 'd split each line when there 's only one item per line . </p>
<p>However , there 's really no reason to do the looping yourself . </p>
<pre><code>with open('words') as f3data:
    mydict = dict(enumerate(line.strip() for line in f3data))
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><pre><code>dict(enumerate(x.rstrip() for x in f3data))
</code></pre>
<p>But your error is key + = 1 . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>The use of zero-based numeric keys in a dict is very suspicious. Consider whether a simple list would suffice . </p>
<p>Here is an example using a list comprehension : </p>
<pre><code>>>> mylist = [word.strip() for word in open('/usr/share/dict/words')]
>>> mylist[1]
'A'
>>> mylist[10]
"Aaron's"
>>> mylist[100]
"Addie's"
>>> mylist[1000]
"Armand's"
>>> mylist[10000]
"Loyd's"
</code></pre>
<p>I use str.strip ( ) to remove whitespace and newlines , which are present in /usr/share/dict/words . This may not be necessary with your data . </p>
<p>However , if you really need a dictionary , Python 's enumerate ( ) built-in function is your friend here , and you can pass the output directly into the dict ( ) function to create it : </p>
<pre><code>>>> mydict = dict(enumerate(word.strip() for word in open('/usr/share/dict/words')))
>>> mydict[1]
'A'
>>> mydict[10]
"Aaron's"
>>> mydict[100]
"Addie's"
>>> mydict[1000]
"Armand's"
>>> mydict[10000]
"Loyd's"

<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>With keys that dense , you do n't want a dict , you want a list . </p>
<pre><code>with open('words') as fp:
    data = map(str.strip, fp.readlines())
</code></pre>
<p>But if you really ca n't live without a dict : </p>
<pre><code>with open('words') as fp:
    data = dict(enumerate(X.strip() for X in fp))
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><pre><code>{index: x.strip() for index, x in enumerate(open('filename.txt'))}
</code></pre>
<p>This code uses a dictionary comprehension and the enumerate built-in , which takes an input sequence ( in this case , the file object , which yields each line when iterated through ) and returns an index along with the item. Then , a dictionary is built up with the index and text . </p>
<p>One question : why not just use a list if all of your keys are integers ? </p>
<p>Finally , your original code should be </p>
<pre><code>f3data = open('words')

mydict = {}

for index, line in enumerate(f3data):
    cmyline = line.strip()
    mydict[index] = cmyline

print mydict
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>Putting the words in a dict makes no sense. If you 're using numbers as keys you should be using a list . </p>
<pre><code>from __future__ import with_statement

with open('words.txt', 'r') as f:
    lines = f.readlines()


words = {}

for n, line in enumerate(lines):
    words[n] = line.strip()

print words
