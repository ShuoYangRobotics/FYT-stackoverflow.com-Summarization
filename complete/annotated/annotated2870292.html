<h3>Question ( ID-2870292 ) : </h3><h2>Python readability hints for a Java programmer </h2><p>I 'm a java programmer , but now entering the " realm of python " for some stuff for which Python works better. I 'm quite sure a good portion of my code would look weird for a Python programmer ( e.g. using parenthesis on every if ) . </p>
<p>I know each language has its own conventions and set of " habits " . So , from a readability standpoint what are conventions and practices which is " the way to go " in Java , but are not really the " pythonic way " to do stuff ? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-6 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>There 's no simple answer to that question. It takes time for your code to be " Pythonic " . Do n't try and recreate Java idioms in Python. It will just take time to learn Python idioms . </p>
<p>Take a look at Code Like a Pythonista : Idiomatic Python , Style Guide for Python Code and Python for Java Programmers . </p>

<p>A lot follows from this principle : no redundant parentheses , no semicolons , no silly " ascii boxes " in comments and docstrings , no wasted space to " align " things on different rows , single quotes unless you specifically need double quotes , no \ to continue lines except when mandatory , no comments that merely remind the reader of the language 's rules ( if the reader does not know the language you 're in trouble anyway ; - ) , and so forth . </p>
<p>I should point out that some of these consequences of the " Tufte spirit of Python " are more controversial than others , within the Python community. But the language sure respects " Tufte 's Spirit " pretty well.. . </p>
<p>Moving to " more controversial " ( but sanctioned by the Zen of Python -- import this at an interpreter prompt ) : " flat is better than nested " , so " get out as soon as sensible " rather than nesting. Let me explain : </p>
<pre><code>if foo:
  return bar
else:
  baz = fie(fum)
  return baz + blab
</code></pre>
<p>this is n't terrible , but neither is it optimal : since " return " ` ` gets out' ' , you can save the nesting : </p>
<pre><code>if foo:
  return bar
baz = fie(fum)
return baz + blab
</code></pre>
<p>A sharper example : </p>
<pre><code>for item in container:
  if interesting(item):
    dothis(item)
    dothat(item)
    theother(item)
</code></pre>
<p>that large block being double-nested is not neat... consider the flatter style : </p>
<pre><code>for item in container:
  if not interesting(item):
    continue
  dothis(item)
  dothat(item)
  theother(item)
</code></pre>
<p>BTW , and an aside that 's not specifically of Python-exclusive style -- one of my pet peeves ( in any language , but in Python Tufte 's Spirit supports me ; - ) : </p>
<pre><code>if not something:
  this()
  that()
  theother()
else:
  blih()
  bluh()
  blah()
</code></pre>
<p>" if not ... else " is contorted ! Swap the two halves and lose the not : </p>
<pre><code>if something:
  blih()
  bluh()
  blah()
else:
  this()
  that()
  theother()
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>The best place to start is probably PEP-8 , which is the official Python style guide. It covers a lot of the basics for what is considered standard . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>In addition , some previous stackoverflow questions : </p>

<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>" Everything is a class " is a Java idiom that 's specifically not a Python idiom. ( Almost ) everything can be a class in Python , and if that 's more comfortable for you then go for it , but Python does n't require such a thing. Python is not a purely object-oriented language , and in my ( limited ) experience it 's good to take that to heart . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>Syntax is only the tip of an iceberg. There are a number of different language construct that Java programmers should be aware of , e.g. Python do not need to use interface </p>
<p>Creating an interface and swappable implementations in python - Stack Overflow </p>
<p>The other really useful idiom is everything can be convert to a boolean value with an intuitive meaning in Python. For example , to check for an empty array , you simply do </p>
<pre><code>if not my_array:
  return
...process my_array...
</code></pre>
<p>The first condition is equivalent to Java 's </p>
<pre><code>if ((my_array == null) || (my_array.length == 0)) {
  return
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is a godsend in Python. Not only is it more concise , it also avoid a Java pitfall where many people do not check for both conditions consistently. Countless NullPointerException are averted as a result . </p>
