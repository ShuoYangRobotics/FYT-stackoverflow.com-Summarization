<h3>Question ( ID-5432121 ) : </h3><h2>Python method that is also a <span style="background-color:yellow;">generator</span> function ? </h2><p>I 'm trying to build a method that also acts like a <span style="background-color:yellow;">generator</span> function , at a flip of a switch ( want_gen below ) . </p>
<p>Something like : </p>
<pre><code>def optimize(x, want_gen):
    # ... declaration and validation code
    for i in range(100):
        # estimate foo, bar, baz
        # ... some code here

        x = calculate_next_x(x, foo, bar, baz)

        if want_gen:
           yield x

    if not want_gen:
       return x
</code></pre>
<p>But of course this does n't work -- Python apparently does n't allow yield and return in the same method , even though they can not be executed simultaneously . </p>
<p>The code is quite involved , and refactoring the declaration and validation code does n't make much sense ( too many state variables -- I will end up with difficult-to-name helper routines of 7 + parameters , which is decidedly ugly ) . And of course , I 'd like to avoid code duplication as much as possible . </p>
<p>Is there some code pattern that would make sense here to achieve the behaviour I want ? </p>
<hr />
<p>Why do I need that ? </p>
<p>I have a rather complicated and time-consuming optimization routine , and I 'd like to get feedback about its current state during runtime ( to display in e.g. GUI ) . The old behaviour needs to be there for backwards compatibility. Multithreading and messaging is too much work for too little additional benefit , especially when cross-platform operation is necessary . </p>
<p>Edit : Perhaps I should have mentioned that since each optimization step is rather lengthy ( there are some numerical simulations involved as well ) , I 'd like to be able to " step in " at a certain iteration and twiddle some parameters , or abort the whole business altogether. The <span style="background-color:yellow;">generators</span> seemed like a good idea , since I could launch another iteration at my discretion , fiddling in the meantime with some parameters . </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-7 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>Since all you seem to want is some sort of feedback for a long running function , why not just pass in a reference to a callback procedure that will be called at regular intervals ? </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>It 's not completely clear what you want to happen if you switch between <span style="background-color:yellow;">generator</span> and function modes . </p>
<p>But as a first try : perhaps <span style="background-color:yellow;">wrap</span> the <span style="background-color:yellow;">generator</span> version in a new method which explicitly throws away the intermediate steps ? </p>
<pre><code>def gen():
    for i in range(100):
        yield i

def wrap():
    for x in gen():
        pass
    return x

print "wrap=", wrap()
</code></pre>
<p>With this version you could step into <span style="background-color:yellow;">gen</span> ( ) by looping over smaller numbers of the range , make adjustments , and then use <span style="background-color:yellow;">wrap</span> ( ) only when you want to finish up . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>An edit to my answer , why not just always yeild ? You can have a function which yields a single value. If you do n't want that then just choose to have your function either return a <span style="background-color:yellow;">generator</span> itself or the value : </p>
<pre><code> def stuff(x, want_gen):
     if want_gen:
         def my_gen(x):
             #code with yield
         return my_gen
     else:
         return x
</code></pre>
<p>That way you are always returning a value. In Python , functions are <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>Kind of messy , but I think this does the same as your original code was asking : </p>
<pre><code>def optimize(x, want_gen):
    def optimize_gen(x):
        # ... declaration and validation code
        for i in range(100):
            # estimate foo, bar, baz
            # ... some code here

            x = calculate_next_x(x, foo, bar, baz)

            if want_gen:
               yield x
    if want_gen:
        return optimize_gen(x)

    for x in optimize_gen(x):
        pass
    return x
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively the for loop at the end could be written : </p>
<pre><code>    return list(optimize_gen(x))[-1]
</code></pre>
<p>Now ask yourself if you really want to do this. Why do you sometimes want the whole sequence and sometimes only want the last element ? Smells a bit fishy to me . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Simplest is to write two methods , one the <span style="background-color:yellow;">generator</span> and the other calling the <span style="background-color:yellow;">generator</span> and just returning the value. If you really want one function with both possibilities , you can always use the want_gen flag to test what sort of return value , returning the iterator produced by the <span style="background-color:yellow;">generator</span> function when True and just the value otherwise . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>Well...we can always remember that yield wa simplemented in thelanguage as way to facilitate the existence of <span style="background-color:yellow;">generator</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> , but one can always implet them either from scratch , or getting the best of both worlds : </p>
<pre><code>class  Optimize(object):
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.x = x
    def __iter__(self):
        x = self.x
        # ... declaration and validation code
        for i in range(100):
            # estimate foo, bar, baz
            # ... some code here

            x = calculate_next_x(x, foo, bar, baz)
            yield x
    def __call__(self):
        gen = iter(self)
        return gen.next()

def optimize(x, wantgen):
    if wantgen:
        return iter(Optimize(x))
    else:
        return Optimize(x)()
</code></pre>
<p>Not that you dont even need the " <span style="background-color:yellow;">optimize</span> " function <span style="background-color:yellow;">wrapper</span> - I just put it in there so it becomes a drop-in replacement for your example ( would it work ) . </p>
<p>The way the class is declared , you can do simply : </p>
<pre><code>for y in Optimize(x):
    #code
</code></pre>
<p>to use it as a <span style="background-color:yellow;">generator</span> , or : </p>
<pre><code> k = Optimize(x)()
</code></pre>
<p>to use it as a function . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>How about this pattern. Make your 3 line of changes to convert the function to a <span style="background-color:yellow;">generator.</span> Rename it to NewFunctionName. Replace the existing function with one that either returns the <span style="background-color:yellow;">generator</span> if want_gen is True , or exhausts the <span style="background-color:yellow;">generator</span> and returns the final value . </p>
