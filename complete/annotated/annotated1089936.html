<h3>Question ( ID-1089936 ) : </h3><h2>Is &amp ; faster than % when checking for odd <span style="background-color:yellow;">numbers</span> ? </h2><p>To check for odd and even integer , is the lowest bit checking more efficient than using the modulo ? </p>
<pre><code>>>> def isodd(num):
        return num & 1 and True or False

>>> isodd(10)
False
>>> isodd(9)
True

<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-7 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>Yep. The timeit module in the standard library is how you check on those things. E.g : </p>
<pre><code>AmAir:stko aleax$ python -mtimeit -s'def isodd(x): x & 1' 'isodd(9)'
1000000 loops, best of 3: 0.446 usec per loop
AmAir:stko aleax$ python -mtimeit -s'def isodd(x): x & 1' 'isodd(10)'
1000000 loops, best of 3: 0.443 usec per loop
AmAir:stko aleax$ python -mtimeit -s'def isodd(x): x % 2' 'isodd(10)'
1000000 loops, best of 3: 0.453 usec per loop
AmAir:stko aleax$ python -mtimeit -s'def isodd(x): x % 2' 'isodd(9)'
1000000 loops, best of 3: 0.461 usec per loop

<p>As you see , on my ( first-day = = old = = slow ; - ) Macbook Air , the &amp ; solution is repeatably between 7 and 18 nanoseconds faster than the % solution . </p>
<p>timeit not only tells you what 's faster , but by how much ( just run the tests a few times ) , which usually shows how supremely UNimportant it is ( do you really care about <span style="background-color:yellow;">10</span> nanoseconds ' difference , when the overhead of calling the function is around 400 ? ! - ) .. . </p>
<p>Convincing programmers that micro-optimizations are essentially irrelevant has proven to be an impossible task -- even though it 's been 35 years ( over which computers have gotten orders of magnitude faster ! ) since Knuth wrote </p>
<blockquote>We should forget about small efficiencies , say about <span style="background-color:yellow;">97</span> % of the time : premature optimization is the root of all evil . </blockquote>
<p>which as he explained is a quote from an even older statement from Hoare. I guess everybody 's totally convinced that THEIR case falls in the remaining 3 % ! </p>
<p>So instead of endlessly repeating " it does n't matter " , we ( Tim Peters in particular deserves the honors there ) put in the standard Python library module timeit , that makes it trivially easy to measure such micro-benchmarks and thereby lets at least some programmers convince themselves that , hmmm , this case DOES fall in the <span style="background-color:yellow;">97</span> % group ! - ) </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>To be totally honest , I do n't think it matters . </p>
<p>The first issue is readability. What makes more sense to other developers ? I , personally , would expect a modulo when checking the evenness/oddness of a <span style="background-color:yellow;">number.</span> I would expect that most other developers would expect the same thing. By introducing a different , and unexpected , method , you might make code reading , and therefore maintenance , more difficult . </p>
<p>The second is just a fact that you probably wo n't ever have a bottleneck when doing either operation. I 'm for optimization , but early optimization is the worst thing you can do in any language or environment. If , for some reason , determining if a <span style="background-color:yellow;">number</span> is even or odd is a bottleneck , then find the fastest way of solving the problem. However , this brings me back to my first point - the first time you write a routine , it should be written in the most readable way possible . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>" return <span style="background-color:yellow;">num</span> &amp ; 1 and True or False " ? Wah ! If you 're speed-crazy ( 1 ) " return <span style="background-color:yellow;">num</span> &amp ; 1 " ( 2 ) inline it : if somenumber % 2 = = 1 is legible AND beats <span style="background-color:yellow;">isodd</span> ( somenumber ) because it avoids the Python function call . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>The best optimization you can get is to not put the test into a function. ' <span style="background-color:yellow;">number</span> % 2 ' and 'number &amp ; 1 ' are very common ways of checking odd/evenness , experienced programmers will recognize the pattern instantly , and you can always throw in a comment such as ' # if <span style="background-color:yellow;">number</span> is odd , then blah blah blah ' if you really need it to be obvious . </p>
<pre><code># state whether number is odd or even
if number & 1:
    print "Your number is odd"
else:
    print "Your number is even"

<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>John brings up a good point. The real overhead is in the function call : </p>

<p>Interestingly both methods remore the same time without the function call . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>Apart from the evil optimization , it takes away the very idiomatic " var % 2 = = 0 " that every coder understands without looking twice. So this is violates pythons zen as well for very little gain . </p>
<p>Furthermore a = b and True or False has been superseded for better readability by </p>
<p>return True if <span style="background-color:yellow;">num</span> &amp ; 1 else False </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>Was really surprised none of the above answers did both variable setup ( timing literal is different story ) and no function invocation ( which obviously hides " lower terms " ) . Stuck on that timing from ipython 's timeit , where I got clear winner <span style="background-color:yellow;">x&amp</span> ; 1 - better for ~ 18 % using python2.6 ( ~ 12 % using python3.1 ) . </p>
