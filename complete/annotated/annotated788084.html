<h3>Question ( ID-788084 ) : </h3><h2>How can I optimize this Python code ? </h2><p>Profiling shows this is the slowest segment of my code for a <span style="background-color:yellow;">little</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">word</span> game I wrote : </p>
<pre><code>def distance(word1, word2):
    difference = 0
    for i in range(len(word1)):
        if word1[i] != word2[i]:
            difference += 1
    return difference

def getchildren(word, wordlist):
    return [ w for w in wordlist if distance(word, w) == 1 ]
</code></pre>
<p>" <span style="background-color:yellow;">distance</span> " is called over 5 million times , majority of which is from <span style="background-color:yellow;">getchildren</span> , which is supposed to get all <span style="background-color:yellow;">words</span> in the <span style="background-color:yellow;">wordlist</span> that differ from " <span style="background-color:yellow;">word</span> " by exactly 1 letter . </p>
<p>I 'm fairly <span style="background-color:yellow;">new</span> to Python ( started learning it 3 days ago ) so comments on naming conventions or other style things also appreciated . </p>
<p>Edit : Forgot to mention that <span style="background-color:yellow;">wordlist</span> is pre-filtered to only have <span style="background-color:yellow;">words</span> containing the same number of letters as " <span style="background-color:yellow;">word</span> " so it 's guaranteed that " <span style="background-color:yellow;">word1</span> " and " <span style="background-color:yellow;">word2</span> " have the same number of chars . </p>
<p>Results : </p>
<p>Thanks everyone , with combinations of <span style="background-color:yellow;">different</span> suggestions I got the program running twice as fast now ( on top of the optimizations I did on my own before asking , so 4 times speed increase approx from my initial implementation ) </p>
<p>I tested with 2 sets of inputs which I 'll call A and B Optimization1 : From </p>
<pre><code>for i in range(len(word1)):
        if word1[i] != word2[i]:
            difference += 1
    return difference
</code></pre>
<p>to </p>
<pre><code>for x,y in zip (word1, word2):
        if x != y:
            difference += 1
    return difference
</code></pre>
<p>Got execution time from 11.92 to 9.18 for input A , and 79.30 to 74.59 for input B </p>
<p>Optimization2 : Added a separate method for differs by one in addition to the <span style="background-color:yellow;">distance</span> method ( which I still <span style="background-color:yellow;">needed</span> elsewhere for the A * heuristics ) </p>
<pre><code>def is_neighbors(word1,word2):
    different = False
    for c1,c2 in zip(word1,word2):
        if c1 != c2:
            if different:
                return False
            different = True
    return different
</code></pre>
<p>Got execution time from 9.18 to 8.83 for input A , and 74.59 to 70.14 for input B </p>
<p>Optimization3 : Big winner here was to use <span style="background-color:yellow;">izip</span> instead of zip </p>
<p>Got execution time from 8.83 to 5.02 for input A , and 70.14 to 41.69 for input B </p>
<p>I could probably do better writing it in a lower level language , but I 'm happy with this for now. Thanks everyone ! </p>
<p>Edit again : More results Using Mark 's method of checking the case where the first letter does n't match got it down from 5.02 -&gt ; 3.59 and 41.69 -&gt ; 29.82 </p>
<p>Building on that and incorporating <span style="background-color:yellow;">izip</span> instead of range , I ended up with this : </p>
<pre><code>def is_neighbors(word1,word2):
    if word1[0] != word2[0]:
        return word1[1:] == word2[1:]
    different = False
    for x,y in izip(word1[1:],word2[1:]):
        if x != y:
            if different:
                return False
            different = True
    return different
</code></pre>
<p>Which squeezed a <span style="background-color:yellow;">little</span> bit more , bringing the times down from 3.59 -&gt ; 3.38 and 29.82 -&gt ; 27.88 </p>
<p>Even more results ! </p>
<p>Trying Sumudu 's suggestion that I generate a <span style="background-color:yellow;">list</span> of all <span style="background-color:yellow;">strings</span> that are 1 letter off from " <span style="background-color:yellow;">word</span> " and then checking to see which ones were in the <span style="background-color:yellow;">wordlist</span> , instead of the is_neighbor function I ended up with this : </p>
<pre><code>def one_letter_off_strings(word):
    import string
    dif_list = []
    for i in xrange(len(word)):
        dif_list.extend((word[:i] + l + word[i+1:] for l in string.ascii_lowercase if l != word[i]))
    return dif_list

def getchildren(word, wordlist):
    oneoff = one_letter_off_strings(word)
    return ( w for w in oneoff if w in wordlist )
</code></pre>
<p>Which ended up being slower ( 3.38 -&gt ; 3.74 and 27.88 -&gt ; 34.40 ) but it seemed promising. At first I thought the part I 'd <span style="background-color:yellow;">need</span> to optimize was " <span style="background-color:yellow;">one_letter_off_strings</span> " but profiling showed otherwise and that the slow part was in fact </p>
<pre><code>( w for w in oneoff if w in wordlist )
</code></pre>
<p>I thought if there 'd be any difference if I switched " <span style="background-color:yellow;">oneoff</span> " and " <span style="background-color:yellow;">wordlist</span> " and did the comparison the other way when it hit me that I was looking for the intersection of the 2 <span style="background-color:yellow;">lists.</span> I replace that with : </p>
<pre><code>return set(oneoff) & set(wordlist)
</code></pre>
<p>Bam ! 3.74 -&gt ; <span style="background-color:yellow;">0.23</span> and 34.40 -&gt ; 2.25 </p>
<p>This is truely amazing , total speed difference from my original naive implementation : 23.79 -&gt ; <span style="background-color:yellow;">0.23</span> and 180.07 -&gt ; 2.25 , so approx 80 to 100 times faster than the original implementation . </p>
<p>If anyone is interested , I made blog post describing the program and describing the optimizations made including one that is n't mentioned here ( because it 's in a <span style="background-color:yellow;">different</span> section of code ) . </p>
<p>The Great Debate : </p>
<p>Ok , me and Unknown are having a big debate which <span style="background-color:yellow;">you</span> can read in the comments of his <span style="background-color:yellow;">answer</span> . He claims that it would be faster using the original method ( using is_neighbor instead of using the sets ) if it was ported to C. I tried for 2 hours to get a C module I wrote to build and be <span style="background-color:yellow;">linkable</span> without much success after trying to follow this and this example , and it looks <span style="background-color:yellow;">like</span> the process is a <span style="background-color:yellow;">little</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">different</span> in Windows ? I do n't know , but I gave up on that. Anyway , here 's the full code of the program , and the text file come from the 12dict <span style="background-color:yellow;">word</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">list</span> using the " 2 + 2lemma.txt " file. Sorry if the code 's a <span style="background-color:yellow;">little</span> messy , this was just something I hacked together. Also I forgot to strip out commas from the <span style="background-color:yellow;">wordlist</span> so that 's actually a bug that <span style="background-color:yellow;">you</span> can leave in for the sake of the same comparison or fix it by adding a comma to the <span style="background-color:yellow;">list</span> of chars in <span style="background-color:yellow;">cleanentries</span> . </p>

<p>I left the <span style="background-color:yellow;">is_neighbors</span> method in even though it 's not used. This is the method that is proposed to be ported to C. To use it , just replace <span style="background-color:yellow;">getchildren</span> with this : </p>
<pre><code>def getchildren(word, wordlist):
    return ( w for w in wordlist if is_neighbors(word, w))
</code></pre>
<p>As for getting it to work as a C module I did n't get that far , but this is what I came up with : </p>
<pre><code>#include "Python.h"

static PyObject *
py_is_neighbor(PyObject *self, Pyobject *args)
{
    int length;
    const char *word1, *word2;
    if (!PyArg_ParseTuple(args, "ss", &word1, &word2, &length))
        return NULL;

    int i;
    int different = 0;
    for (i =0; i < length; i++)
    {
        if (*(word1 + i) != *(word2 + i))
        {
            if (different)
            {
                return Py_BuildValue("i", different);
            }
            different = 1;
        }
    }
    return Py_BuildValue("i", different);
}

PyMethodDef methods[] = {
    {"isneighbor", py_is_neighbor, METH_VARARGS, "Returns whether words are neighbors"},
    {NULL, NULL, 0, NULL}
};

PyMODINIT_FUNC
initIsNeighbor(void)
{
    Py_InitModule("isneighbor", methods);
}
</code></pre>
<p>I profiled this using : </p>
<blockquote>python -m cProfile " Wordgame.py " </blockquote>
<p>And the time recorded was the total time of the <span style="background-color:yellow;">AStar</span> method call. The fast input set was " verse poets " and the long input set was " poets verse " . Timings will obviously vary between <span style="background-color:yellow;">different</span> machines , so if anyone does end up trying this give result comparison of the program as is , as well as with the C module . </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-11 ) : </h3><b># <span style="background-color:yellow;">0</span> </b><br /><p>If <span style="background-color:yellow;">your</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">wordlist</span> is very long , might it be more efficient to generate all possible 1-letter-differences from 'word ' , then check which ones are in the <span style="background-color:yellow;">list</span> ? I do n't know any Python but there should be a suitable data structure for the <span style="background-color:yellow;">wordlist</span> allowing for log-time lookups . </p>
<p>I suggest this because if <span style="background-color:yellow;">your</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">words</span> are reasonable <span style="background-color:yellow;">lengths</span> ( ~ 10 letters ) , then <span style="background-color:yellow;">you</span> 'll only be looking for 250 potential <span style="background-color:yellow;">words</span> , which is probably faster if <span style="background-color:yellow;">your</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">wordlist</span> is larger than a few hundred <span style="background-color:yellow;">words</span> . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>Your function <span style="background-color:yellow;">distance</span> is calculating the total <span style="background-color:yellow;">distance</span> , when <span style="background-color:yellow;">you</span> really only care about <span style="background-color:yellow;">distance</span> = 1. The majority of cases <span style="background-color:yellow;">you</span> 'll know it 's &gt ; 1 within a few characters , so <span style="background-color:yellow;">you</span> could return early and save a lot of time . </p>
<p>Beyond that , there might be a better algorithm , but I ca n't think of it . </p>
<p>Edit : Another idea . </p>
<p>You can make 2 cases , depending on whether the first character matches. If it does n't match , the rest of the <span style="background-color:yellow;">word</span> has to match exactly , and <span style="background-color:yellow;">you</span> can test for that in one shot. Otherwise , do it similarly to what <span style="background-color:yellow;">you</span> were doing. You could even do it recursively , but I do n't think that would be faster . </p>
<pre><code>def DifferentByOne(word1, word2):
    if word1[0] != word2[0]:
        return word1[1:] == word2[1:]
    same = True
    for i in range(1, len(word1)):
        if word1[i] != word2[i]:
            if same:
                same = False
            else:
                return False
    return not same
</code></pre>
<p>Edit 2 : I 've deleted the check to see if the <span style="background-color:yellow;">strings</span> are the same <span style="background-color:yellow;">length</span> , since <span style="background-color:yellow;">you</span> say it 's redundant. Running Ryan 's tests on my own code and on the <span style="background-color:yellow;">is_neighbors</span> function provided by MizardX , I get the following : </p>
<ul>Original <span style="background-color:yellow;">distance</span> ( ) : 3.7 seconds My <span style="background-color:yellow;">DifferentByOne</span> ( ) : 1.1 seconds MizardX 's <span style="background-color:yellow;">is_neighbors</span> ( ) : 3.7 seconds </ul>
<p>Edit 3 : ( Probably getting into community wiki territory here , but... ) </p>
<p>Trying <span style="background-color:yellow;">your</span> final definition of <span style="background-color:yellow;">is_neighbors</span> ( ) with <span style="background-color:yellow;">izip</span> instead of zip : 2.9 seconds . </p>
<p>Here 's my latest version , which still times at 1.1 seconds : </p>
<pre><code>def DifferentByOne(word1, word2):

<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>People are mainly going about this by trying to write a quicker function , but there might be another way. . </p>
<blockquote>" <span style="background-color:yellow;">distance</span> " is called over 5 million times </blockquote>
<p>Why is this ? Perhaps a better way to optimise is to try and reduce the number of calls to <span style="background-color:yellow;">distance</span> , rather than shaving milliseconds of <span style="background-color:yellow;">distance</span> 's execution time. It 's impossible to tell without seeing the full script , but optimising a specific function is generally unnecessary . </p>
<p>If that is impossible , perhaps <span style="background-color:yellow;">you</span> could write it as a C module ? </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Well <span style="background-color:yellow;">you</span> can start by having <span style="background-color:yellow;">your</span> loop break if the difference is 2 or more . </p>
<p>Also <span style="background-color:yellow;">you</span> can change </p>
<pre><code>for i in range(len(word1)):
</code></pre>
<p>to </p>
<pre><code>for i in xrange(len(word1)):
</code></pre>
<p>Because <span style="background-color:yellow;">xrange</span> generates <span style="background-color:yellow;">sequences</span> on demand instead of generating the whole range of numbers at once . </p>
<p>You can also try comparing <span style="background-color:yellow;">word</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">lengths</span> which would be quicker. Also note that <span style="background-color:yellow;">your</span> code does n't work if <span style="background-color:yellow;">word1</span> is greater than <span style="background-color:yellow;">word2</span> </p>
<p>There 's not much else <span style="background-color:yellow;">you</span> can do algorithmically after that , which is to say <span style="background-color:yellow;">you</span> 'll probably find more of a speedup by porting that section to C . </p>
<p>Edit 2 </p>
<p>Attempting to explain my analysis of Sumudu 's algorithm compared to verifying differences char by char . </p>
<p>When <span style="background-color:yellow;">you</span> have a <span style="background-color:yellow;">word</span> of <span style="background-color:yellow;">length</span> L , the number of " differs-by-one " <span style="background-color:yellow;">words</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">you</span> will generate will be 25L. We know from implementations of sets on modern computers , that the search speed is approximately log ( n ) base 2 , where n is the number of elements to search for . </p>
<p>Seeing that most of the 5 million <span style="background-color:yellow;">words</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">you</span> test against is not in the set , most of the time , <span style="background-color:yellow;">you</span> will be traversing the entire set , which means that it really becomes log ( 25L ) instead of only log ( 25L ) /2. ( and this is assuming best case scenario for sets that comparing <span style="background-color:yellow;">string</span> by <span style="background-color:yellow;">string</span> is equivalent to comparing char by char ) </p>
<p>Now we take a look at the time complexity for determining a " differs-by-one " . If we assume that <span style="background-color:yellow;">you</span> have to check the entire <span style="background-color:yellow;">word</span> , then the number of operations per <span style="background-color:yellow;">word</span> becomes L . We know that most <span style="background-color:yellow;">words</span> differ by 2 very quickly. And knowing that most prefixes take up a small portion of the <span style="background-color:yellow;">word</span> , we can logically assume that <span style="background-color:yellow;">you</span> will break most of the time by L/2 , or half the <span style="background-color:yellow;">word</span> ( and this is a conservative estimate ) . </p>
<p>So now we plot the time complexities of the two searches , L/2 and log ( 25L ) , and keeping in mind that this is even considering <span style="background-color:yellow;">string</span> matching the same speed as char matching ( highly in favor of sets ) . You have the equation log ( 25 * L ) &gt ; L/2 , which can be simplified down to log ( 25 ) &gt ; L/2 - log ( L ) . As <span style="background-color:yellow;">you</span> can see from the graph , it should be quicker to use the char matching algorithm until <span style="background-color:yellow;">you</span> reach very large numbers of L . </p>

<blockquote>Also , I do n't know if <span style="background-color:yellow;">you</span> 're counting breaking on difference of 2 or more in <span style="background-color:yellow;">your</span> optimization , but from Mark 's <span style="background-color:yellow;">answer</span> I already break on a difference of 2 or more , and actually , if the difference in the first letter , it breaks after the first letter , and even in spite of all those optimizations , changing to using sets just blew them out of the water. I 'm interested in trying <span style="background-color:yellow;">your</span> idea though </blockquote>
<p>I was the first person in this question to suggest breaking on a difference of 2 or more. The thing is , that Mark 's idea of <span style="background-color:yellow;">string</span> slicing ( if <span style="background-color:yellow;">word1</span> [ <span style="background-color:yellow;">0</span> ] ! = <span style="background-color:yellow;">word2</span> [ <span style="background-color:yellow;">0</span> ] : return <span style="background-color:yellow;">word1</span> [ 1 : ] = = <span style="background-color:yellow;">word2</span> [ 1 : ] ) is simply putting what we are doing into C. How do <span style="background-color:yellow;">you</span> think <span style="background-color:yellow;">word1</span> [ 1 : ] = = <span style="background-color:yellow;">word2</span> [ 1 : ] is calculated ? The same way that we are doing . </p>
<blockquote>I read <span style="background-color:yellow;">your</span> explanation a few times but I did n't quite follow it , would <span style="background-color:yellow;">you</span> mind explaining it a <span style="background-color:yellow;">little</span> more indepth ? Also I 'm not terribly familiar with C and I 've been working in high-level languages for the past few <span style="background-color:yellow;">years</span> ( closest has been learning C + + in high school 6 <span style="background-color:yellow;">years</span> ago </blockquote>
<p>As for producing the C code , I am a bit busy. I am sure <span style="background-color:yellow;">you</span> will be able to do it since <span style="background-color:yellow;">you</span> have written in C before. You could also try C # , which probably has similar performance characteristics . </p>
<p>More Explanation </p>
<p>Here is a more indepth explanation to Davy8 </p>
<pre><code>def getchildren(word, wordlist):
    oneoff = one_letter_off_strings(word)
    return set(oneoff) & set(wordlist)
</code></pre>
<p>Your <span style="background-color:yellow;">one_letter_off_strings</span> function will create a set of 25L <span style="background-color:yellow;">strings</span> ( where L is the number of letters ) . </p>
<p>Creating a set from the <span style="background-color:yellow;">wordlist</span> will create a set of D <span style="background-color:yellow;">strings</span> ( where D is the <span style="background-color:yellow;">length</span> of <span style="background-color:yellow;">your</span> dictionary ) . By creating an intersection from this , <span style="background-color:yellow;">you</span> MUST iterate over each <span style="background-color:yellow;">oneoff</span> and see if it exists in <span style="background-color:yellow;">wordlist</span> . </p>
<p>The time complexity for this operation is detailed above. This operation is less efficient than comparing the <span style="background-color:yellow;">word</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">you</span> want with each <span style="background-color:yellow;">word</span> in <span style="background-color:yellow;">wordlist</span> . Sumudu 's method is an optimization in C rather than in algorithm . </p>
<p>More Explanation 2 </p>
<blockquote>There 's only 4500 total <span style="background-color:yellow;">words</span> ( because the <span style="background-color:yellow;">wordlist</span> is pre-filtered for 5 letter <span style="background-color:yellow;">words</span> before even being passed to the algorithm ) , being intersected with 125 one-letter-off <span style="background-color:yellow;">words.</span> It seemed that <span style="background-color:yellow;">you</span> were saying intersection is log ( smaller ) or in otherwords log ( 125 , 2 ) . Compare this to again assuming what <span style="background-color:yellow;">you</span> said , where comparing a <span style="background-color:yellow;">word</span> breaks in L/2 letters , I 'll round this down to 2 , even though for a 5 letter <span style="background-color:yellow;">word</span> it 's more <span style="background-color:yellow;">likely</span> to be 3. This comparison is done 4500 times , so 9000. log ( 125,2 ) is about 6.9 , and log ( 4500,2 ) is about 12. Lem me know if I misinterpreted <span style="background-color:yellow;">your</span> numbers . </blockquote>
<p>To create the intersection of 125 one-letter-off <span style="background-color:yellow;">words</span> with a dictionary of 4500 , <span style="background-color:yellow;">you</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">need</span> to make 125 * 4500 comparisons. This is not log ( 125,2 ) . It is at best 125 * log ( 4500 , 2 ) assuming that the dictionary is presorted. There is no magic shortcut to sets. You are also doing a <span style="background-color:yellow;">string</span> by <span style="background-color:yellow;">string</span> instead of char by char comparison here . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>How often is the <span style="background-color:yellow;">distance</span> function called with the same arguments ? A simple to implement optimization would be to use memoization . </p>
<p>You could probably also create some sort of dictionary with frozensets of letters and <span style="background-color:yellow;">lists</span> of <span style="background-color:yellow;">words</span> that differ by one and look up values in that. This datastructure could either be stored and loaded through pickle or generated from scratch at startup . </p>
<p>Short circuiting the evaluation will only give <span style="background-color:yellow;">you</span> gains if the <span style="background-color:yellow;">words</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">you</span> are using are very long , since the hamming <span style="background-color:yellow;">distance</span> algorithm <span style="background-color:yellow;">you</span> 're using is basically O ( n ) where n is the <span style="background-color:yellow;">word</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">length</span> . </p>
<p>I did some experiments with timeit for some alternative approaches that may be illustrative . </p>

<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>For such a simple function that has such a large performance implication , I would probably make a C <span style="background-color:yellow;">library</span> and call it using ctypes . One of reddit 's founders claims they made the website 2x as fast using this technique . </p>
<p>You can also use psyco on this function , but beware that it can eat up a lot of memory . </p>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>I do n't know if it will significantly affect <span style="background-color:yellow;">your</span> speed , but <span style="background-color:yellow;">you</span> could start by turning the <span style="background-color:yellow;">list</span> comprehension into a generator expression. It 's still iterable so it should n't be much <span style="background-color:yellow;">different</span> in usage : </p>
<pre><code>def getchildren(word, wordlist):
    return [ w for w in wordlist if distance(word, w) == 1 ]
</code></pre>
<p>to </p>
<pre><code>def getchildren(word, wordlist):
    return ( w for w in wordlist if distance(word, w) == 1 )
</code></pre>
<p>The main problem would be that a <span style="background-color:yellow;">list</span> comprehension would construct itself in memory and take up quite a bit of space , whereas the generator will create <span style="background-color:yellow;">your</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">list</span> on the fly so there is no <span style="background-color:yellow;">need</span> to store the whole thing . </p>
<p>Also , following on unknown 's <span style="background-color:yellow;">answer</span> , this may be a more " pythonic " way of writing <span style="background-color:yellow;">distance</span> ( ) : </p>
<pre><code>def distance(word1, word2):
    difference = 0
    for x,y in zip (word1, word2):
        if x == y:
            difference += 1
    return difference
</code></pre>
<p>But it 's confusing what 's intended when <span style="background-color:yellow;">len</span> ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">word1</span> ) ! = <span style="background-color:yellow;">len</span> ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">word2</span> ) , in the case of zip it will only return as many characters as the shortest <span style="background-color:yellow;">word.</span> ( Which could turn out to be an optimization... ) </p>
<br /><b># 8 </b><br /><p>Try this : </p>
<pre><code>def distance(word1, word2):
  return sum([not c1 == c2 for c1, c2 in zip(word1,word2)])
</code></pre>
<p>Also , do <span style="background-color:yellow;">you</span> have a <span style="background-color:yellow;">link</span> to <span style="background-color:yellow;">your</span> game ? I <span style="background-color:yellow;">like</span> being destroyed by <span style="background-color:yellow;">word</span> games </p>
<br /><b># 9 </b><br /><p>First thing to occur to me : </p>
<pre><code>from operator import ne

def distance(word1, word2):
    return sum(map(ne, word1, word2))
</code></pre>
<p>which has a decent chance of going faster than other functions people have posted , because it has no interpreted loops , just calls to Python primitives. And it 's short enough that <span style="background-color:yellow;">you</span> could reasonably inline it into the caller . </p>
<p>For <span style="background-color:yellow;">your</span> higher-level problem , I 'd look into the data structures developed for similarity search in metric spaces , e.g. this paper or this book , <span style="background-color:yellow;">neither</span> of which I 've read ( they came up in a search for a paper I have read but ca n't remember ) . </p>
<br /><b># 10 </b><br /><p>for this snippet : </p>
<pre><code>for x,y in zip (word1, word2):
    if x != y:
        difference += 1
return difference
</code></pre>
<p>i 'd use this one : </p>
<pre><code>return sum(1 for i in xrange(len(word1)) if word1[i] == word2[i])
</code></pre>
<p>the same pattern would follow all around the provided code.. . </p>
