<h3>Question ( ID-1149253 ) : </h3><h2>How to create Classes in Python with highly constrained instances </h2><p>In Python , there are <span style="background-color:yellow;">examples</span> of built-in classes with highly constrained instances. For <span style="background-color:yellow;">example</span> , " None " is the only instance of its class , and in the bool class there are only two <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> , " True " and " False " ( I hope I am more-or-less correct so far ) . </p>
<p>Another good <span style="background-color:yellow;">example</span> are integers : if a and b are instances of the int <span style="background-color:yellow;">type</span> then a = = b implies that a is b . </p>
<p>Two questions : </p>
<ol>How does one create a class with similarly constrained instances ? For <span style="background-color:yellow;">example</span> we could ask for a class with exactly 5 instances. Or there could be infinitely many instances , like <span style="background-color:yellow;">type</span> int , but these are not arbitrary . if integers form a class , why does int ( ) give the 0 instance ? compare this to a user-defined class Cl , where Cl ( ) would give an instance of the class , not a specific unique instance , like 0. Should n't int ( ) return an unspecified integer <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> , i.e. an integer without a specified value ? </ol>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-7 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>You 're talking about giving a class value semantics , which is typically done by creating class instances in the normal way , but remembering each one , and if a matching instance would be created , give the already created instance instead. In python , this can be achieved by overloading a classes <span style="background-color:yellow;">__new__</span> method . </p>
<p>Brief <span style="background-color:yellow;">example</span> , say we wanted to use pairs of integers to represent coordinates , and have the proper value semantics . </p>
<pre><code>class point(object):
    memo = {}
    def __new__(cls, x, y):
        if (x, y) in cls.memo:         # if it already exists, 
            return cls.memo[(x, y)]    # return the existing instance
        else:                          # otherwise, 
            newPoint = object.__new__(cls) # create it, 
            newPoint.x = x             # initialize it, as you would in __init__
            newPoint.y = y             
            cls.memo[(x, y)] = newPoint # memoize it, 
            return newPoint            # and return it!

<br /><b># <span style="background-color:yellow;">1</span> </b><br /><p>Looks like # <span style="background-color:yellow;">1</span> has been well answered already and I just want to explain a principle , related to # <span style="background-color:yellow;">2</span> , which appears to have been missed by all respondents : for most built-in <span style="background-color:yellow;">types</span> , calling the <span style="background-color:yellow;">type</span> without parameters ( the " <span style="background-color:yellow;">default</span> constructor " ) returns an instance of that <span style="background-color:yellow;">type</span> which evaluates as false . That means an empty container for container <span style="background-color:yellow;">types</span> , a number which compares equal to zero for number <span style="background-color:yellow;">types</span> . </p>
<pre><code>>>> import decimal
>>> decimal.Decimal()
Decimal("0")
>>> set()
set([])
>>> float()
0.0
>>> tuple()
()
>>> dict()
{}
>>> list()
[]
>>> str()
''
>>> bool()
False
</code></pre>
<p>See ? Pretty regular indeed ! Moreover , for mutable <span style="background-color:yellow;">types</span> , like most containers , calling the <span style="background-color:yellow;">type</span> always returns a new instance ; for immutable <span style="background-color:yellow;">types</span> , like numbers and strings , it does n't matter ( it 's a possible internal optimization to return new reference to an existing immutable instance , but the implementation is not required to perform such optimization , and if it does it can and often will perform them quite selectively ) since it 's never correct to compare immutable <span style="background-color:yellow;">type</span> instances with is or equivalently by id ( ) . </p>
<p>If you design a <span style="background-color:yellow;">type</span> of which some instances can evaluate as false ( by having __len__ or __nonzero__ special methods in the class ) , it 's advisable to follow the same precept ( have <span style="background-color:yellow;">__init__</span> [ or <span style="background-color:yellow;">__new__</span> for immutables ] , if called without arguments [ [ beyond self for <span style="background-color:yellow;">__init__</span> and 'cls ' for <span style="background-color:yellow;">__new__</span> of course ] ] , prepare a [ [ new , if mutable ] ] " empty " or " zero-like " instance of the class ) . </p>
<br /><b># <span style="background-color:yellow;">2</span> </b><br /><p>For the first question you could implement a singleton class design pattern http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern you should from that restrict the number of instances . </p>
<p>For the second question , I think this kind of explains your issue http : //docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html </p>
<p>Because integers are <span style="background-color:yellow;">types</span> , there are limitations to it . </p>
<p>Here is another resource.. . http : //docs.python.org/library/functions.html # built-in-funcs </p>
<br /><b># <span style="background-color:yellow;">3</span> </b><br /><ol>Create them in advance and return one of those from <span style="background-color:yellow;">__new__</span> instead of creating a new <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> , or cache created instances ( weakrefs are handy here ) and return one of those instead of creating a new <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> . Integers are special. Effectively this means you can never use identity to compare them as you would use identity to compare other <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects.</span> Since they are immutable and rarely used in any way other than a value context , this is n't much of a problem. This is done , as far as I can tell , for implementation reasons more than anything else. ( And since there 's no clear indication that it 's an incorrect way , it 's a good decision. ) </ol>
<p>Singletons such as None : Create the class with the name you want to give the variable , and then rebind the variable to the ( only ) instance , or delete the class afterwards. This is handy when you want to emulate an interface such as getattr , where a parameter is optional but using None is different from not providing a value . </p>
<pre><code>class raise_error(object): pass
raise_error = raise_error()

def example(d, key, default=raise_error):
  """Return d[key] if key in d, else return default or
  raise KeyError if default isn't supplied."""
  try:
    return d[key]
  except KeyError:
    if default is raise_error:
      raise
    return default

<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>To answer the more generic question of how to create constrained instances , it depends on the constraint. Both you <span style="background-color:yellow;">examples</span> above are a sort of " singletons " , although the second <span style="background-color:yellow;">example</span> is a variation where you can have many instances of one class , but you will have only one per input value . </p>
<p>These can both done by overriding the class ' <span style="background-color:yellow;">__new__</span> method , so that the class creates the instances if it has n't been created already , and both returns it , and stores it as an attribute on the class ( as has been suggested above ) . However , a slightly less hackish way is to use metaclasses. These are classes that change the behaviour of classes , and singletons is a great <span style="background-color:yellow;">example</span> of when to use metaclasses. And the great thing about this is that you can reuse metaclasses. By creating a Singleton metaclass , you can then use this metaclass for all Singletons you have . </p>
<p>A nice Python <span style="background-color:yellow;">example</span> in on Wikipedia : http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern # Python </p>
<p>Here is a variation that will create a different instance depending on parameters : ( It 's not perfect. If you pass in a parameter which is a dict , it will fail , for <span style="background-color:yellow;">example.</span> But it 's a start ) : </p>
<pre><code># Notice how you subclass not from object, but from type. You are in other words
# creating a new type of type.
class SingletonPerValue(type):
    def __init__(cls, name, bases, dict):
        super(SingletonPerValue, cls).__init__(name, bases, dict)
        # Here we store the created instances later.
        cls.instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kw):
        # We make a tuple out of all parameters. This is so we can use it as a key
        # This will fail if you send in unhasheable parameters.
        params = args + tuple(kw.items())
        # Check in cls.instances if this combination of parameter has been used:
        if params not in cls.instances:
            # No, this is a new combination of parameters. Create a new instance,
            # and store it in the dictionary:
            cls.instances[params] = super(SingletonPerValue, cls).__call__(*args, **kw)

        return cls.instances[params]


class MyClass(object):
    # Say that this class should use a specific metaclass:
    __metaclass__ = SingletonPerValue

    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

print 1, MyClass(1)
print 2, MyClass(2)
print 2, MyClass(2)
print 2, MyClass(2)
print 3, MyClass(3)

<p>But there are other constraints in Python than instantiation. Many of them can be done with metaclasses. Others have shortcuts , here is a class that only allows you to set the attributes 'items ' and 'fruit ' , for <span style="background-color:yellow;">example</span> . </p>
<pre><code>class Constrained(object):
    __slots__ = ['items', 'fruit']

con = Constrained()
con.items = 6
con.fruit = "Banana"
con.yummy = True
</code></pre>
<p>If you want restrictions on attributes , but not quite these strong , you can override __getattr__ , __setattr__ and __delattr__ to make many fantastic and horrid things happen. : - ) There are also packages out there that let you set constraints on attributes , etc . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>I think some names for the concept you 're thinking about are interning and immutable <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> . </p>
<p>As for an answer to your specific questions , I think for # <span style="background-color:yellow;">1</span> , you could look up your constrained instance in a class method and return it . </p>
<p>For question # <span style="background-color:yellow;">2</span> , I think it 's just a matter of how you specify your class. A non-specific instance of the int class would be pretty useless , so just spec it so it 's impossible to create . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>Note : this is not really an answer to your question , but more a comment I could not fit in the " comment " space . </p>
<p>Please note that a = = b does NOT implies that a is b . </p>
<p>It is true only for first handfuls of integers ( like first hundred or so - I do not know exactly ) and it is only an implementation detail of CPython , that actually changed with the switch to Python <span style="background-color:yellow;">3.0</span> . </p>
<p>For <span style="background-color:yellow;">example</span> : </p>
<pre><code>>>> n1 = 4000
>>> n2 = 4000
>>> n1 == n2
True
>>> n1 is n2
False
