<h3>Question ( ID-382466 ) : </h3><h2>Comparing massive lists of dictionaries in python </h2><p>I never actually thought I 'd run into speed-issues with python , but I have. I 'm trying to compare really big lists of dictionaries to each other based on the dictionary values. I compare two lists , with the first like so </p>
<pre><code>biglist1=[{transaction:"somevalue", id:"somevalue", date:"somevalue" ...}, {transaction:"somevalue", id:"somevalue", date:"somevalue" ...}, ...]
</code></pre>
<p>With " somevalue " standing for a user-generated string , int or decimal. Now , the second list is pretty similar , except the id-values are always empty , as they have not been assigned yet . </p>
<pre><code>biglist2=[{transaction:"somevalue", id:"", date:"somevalue" ...}, {transaction:"somevalue", id:"", date:"somevalue" ...}, ...]
</code></pre>
<p>So I want to get a list of the dictionaries in <span style="background-color:yellow;">biglist2</span> that match the dictionaries in <span style="background-color:yellow;">biglist1</span> for all other keys except id . </p>
<p>I 've been doing </p>
<pre><code>for item in biglist2:
    for transaction in biglist1:
       if item['transaction'] == transaction['transaction']:
          list_transactionnamematches.append(transaction)

for item in biglist2:
    for transaction in list_transactionnamematches:
       if item['date'] == transaction['date']:
          list_transactionnamematches.append(transaction)
</code></pre>
<p>... and so on , not comparing id values , until I get a final list of matches. Since the lists can be really big ( around 3000 + <span style="background-color:yellow;">items</span> each ) , this takes quite some time for python to loop through . </p>
<p>I 'm guessing this is n't really how this kind of comparison should be done. Any ideas ? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-7 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>Index on the fields you want to use for lookup. O ( n + m ) </p>
<pre><code>matches = []
biglist1_indexed = {}

for item in biglist1:
	biglist1_indexed[(item["transaction"], item["date"])] = item

for item in biglist2:
	if (item["transaction"], item["date"]) in biglist1_indexed:
		matches.append(item)

<p>This is probably thousands of times faster than what you 're doing now . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>What you want to do is to use correct data structures : </p>
<ol>Create a dictionary of mappings of tuples of other values in the first dictionary to their id . Create two sets of tuples of values in both dictionaries. Then use set operations to get the tuple set you want . Use the dictionary from the point 1 to assign ids to those tuples . </ol>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>In O ( m * n ) .. . </p>
<pre><code>for item in biglist2:
    for transaction in biglist1:
       if (item['transaction'] == transaction['transaction'] &&
           item['date'] == transaction['date'] &&
           item['foo'] == transaction['foo'] ) :

          list_transactionnamematches.append(transaction)
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>Forgive my rusty python syntax , it 's been a while , so consider this partially pseudocode </p>
<pre><code>import operator
biglist1.sort(key=(operator.itemgetter(2),operator.itemgetter(0)))
biglist2.sort(key=(operator.itemgetter(2),operator.itemgetter(0)))
i1=0;
i2=0;
while i1 < len(biglist1) and i2 < len(biglist2):
    if (biglist1[i1]['date'],biglist1[i1]['transaction']) == (biglist2[i2]['date'],biglist2[i2]['transaction']):
        biglist3.append(biglist1[i1])
        i1++
        i2++
    elif (biglist1[i1]['date'],biglist1[i1]['transaction']) < (biglist2[i2]['date'],biglist2[i2]['transaction']):
        i1++
    elif (biglist1[i1]['date'],biglist1[i1]['transaction']) > (biglist2[i2]['date'],biglist2[i2]['transaction']):
        i2++
    else:
        print "this wont happen if i did the tuple comparison correctly"
</code></pre>
<p>This <span style="background-color:yellow;">sorts</span> both lists into the same order , by ( date,transaction ) . Then it walks through them side by side , stepping through each looking for relatively adjacent matches. It assumes that ( date,transaction ) is unique , and that I am not completely off my rocker with regards to tuple <span style="background-color:yellow;">sorting</span> and comparison . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>The approach I would probably take to this is to make a very , very lightweight class with one instance variable and one method. The instance variable is a pointer to a dictionary ; the method overrides the built-in special method __hash__ ( self ) , returning a value calculated from all the values in the dictionary except id . </p>
<p>From there the solution seems fairly obvious : Create two initially empty dictionaries : N and M ( for no-matches and matches . ) Loop over each list exactly once , and for each of these dictionaries representing a <span style="background-color:yellow;">transaction</span> ( let 's call it a Tx_dict ) , create an instance of the new class ( a Tx_ptr ) . Then test for an <span style="background-color:yellow;">item</span> matching this Tx_ptr in N and M : if there is no matching <span style="background-color:yellow;">item</span> in N , insert the current Tx_ptr into N ; if there is a matching <span style="background-color:yellow;">item</span> in N but no matching <span style="background-color:yellow;">item</span> in M , insert the current Tx_ptr into M with the Tx_ptr itself as a key and a list containing the Tx_ptr as the value ; if there is a matching <span style="background-color:yellow;">item</span> in N and in M , append the current Tx_ptr to the value associated with that key in M . </p>
<p>After you 've gone through every <span style="background-color:yellow;">item</span> once , your dictionary M will contain pointers to all the <span style="background-color:yellow;">transactions</span> which match other <span style="background-color:yellow;">transactions</span> , all neatly grouped together into lists for you . </p>
<p>Edit : Oops ! Obviously , the correct action if there is a matching Tx_ptr in N but not in M is to insert a key-value pair into M with the current Tx_ptr as the key and as the value , a list of the current Tx_ptr and the Tx_ptr that was already in N . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>Have a look at Psyco. Its a Python compiler that can create very fast , optimized machine code from your source . </p>
<p>http : //sourceforge.net/projects/psyco/ </p>
<p>While this is n't a direct solution to your code 's efficiency issues , it could still help speed things up without needing to write any new code. That said , I 'd still highly recommend optimizing your code as much as possible AND use Psyco to squeeze as much speed out of it as possible . </p>
<p>Part of their guide specifically talks about using it to speed up list , string , and numeric computation heavy functions . </p>

<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>I 'm also a newbie. My code is structured in much the same way as his . </p>
<pre><code>for A in biglist:
    for B in biglist:
        if ( A.get('somekey') <> B.get('somekey') and #don't match to itself
             len( set(A.get('list')) - set(B.get('list')) ) > 10:
            [do stuff...]
</code></pre>
<p>This takes hours to run through a list of 10000 dictionaries. Each dictionary contains lots of stuff but I could potentially pull out just the ids ( 'somekey ' ) and lists ( 'list ' ) and rewrite as a single dictionary of 10000 key : value pairs . </p>
<p>Question : how much faster would that be ? And I assume this is faster than using a list of lists , right ? </p>
