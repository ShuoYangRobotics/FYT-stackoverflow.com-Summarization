<h3>Question ( ID-402217 ) : </h3><h2>How to store a dictionary on a Django Model ? </h2><p>I need to store some data on a Django model. These data are not equal to all instances of the model . </p>
<p>At first I thought on subclassing the model , but I 'm trying to keep the application flexible ; if I use subclasses , I 'll need to create a whole class each time i need a new kind of object , and that 's no good. I 'll also end up with a lot of subclasses only to store a pair of extra fields . </p>
<p>I really feel that a dictionary would be the best approach , but there 's nothing on the Djando documentation ( or I ca n't find it ) . </p>
<p>Any clues ? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-9 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>If it 's really dictionary like arbitrary data you 're looking for you can probably use a two-level setup with one model that 's a container and another model that 's key-value pairs. You 'd create an instance of the container , create each of the key-value instances , and associate the set of key-value instances with the container instance. Something like : </p>
<pre><code>class Dicty(models.Model):
    name      = models.CharField(max_length=50)

class KeyVal(models.Model):
    container = models.ForeignKey(Dicty, db_index=True)
    key       = models.CharField(max_length=240, db_index=True)
    value     = models.CharField(max_length=240, db_index=True)
</code></pre>
<p>It 's not pretty , but it 'll let you access/search the innards of the dictionary using the DB whereas a pickle/serialize solution will not . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>As Ned answered , you wo n't be able to query " some data " if you use the dictionary approach . </p>
<p>If you still need to store dictionaries then the best approach , by far , is the PickleField class documented in Marty Alchin 's new book Pro Django . This method uses Python class properties to pickle/unpickle a python object , only on demand , that is stored in a model field . </p>
<p>The basics of this approach is to use django 's contibute_to_class method to dynamically add a new field to your model and uses getattr/setattr to do the serializing on demand . </p>
<p>One of the few online examples I could find that is similar is this definition of a JSONField . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>I 'm not sure exactly sure of the nature of the problem you 're trying to solve , but it sounds curiously similar to Google App Engine 's BigTable Expando . </p>
<p>Expandos allow you to specify and store additional fields on an database-backed object instance at runtime. To quote from the docs : </p>
<pre><code>import datetime
from google.appengine.ext import db

class Song(db.Expando):
  title = db.StringProperty()

crazy = Song(title='Crazy like a diamond',
             author='Lucy Sky',
             publish_date='yesterday',
             rating=5.0)

crazy.last_minute_note=db.Text('Get a train to the station.')
</code></pre>
<p>Google App Engine currently supports both Python and the Django framework. Might be worth looking into if this is the best way to express your models . </p>
<p>Traditional relational database models do n't have this kind of column-addition flexibility. If your datatypes are simple enough you could break from traditional RDBMS philosophy and hack values into a single column via serialization as @ Ned Batchelder proposes ; however , if you have to use an RDBMS , Django model inheritance is probably the way to go. Notably , it will create a one-to-one foreign key relation for each level of derivation . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>Think it over , and find the commonalities of each data set... then define your model. It may require the use of subclasses or not. Foreign keys representing commonalities are n't to be avoided , but encouraged when they make sense . </p>
<p>Stuffing random data into a SQL table is not smart , unless it 's truly non-relational data. If that 's the case , define your problem and we may be able to help . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Django-Geo includes a " DictionaryField " you might find helpful : </p>
<p>http : //code.google.com/p/django-geo/source/browse/trunk/fields.py ? r = 13 # 49 </p>
<p>In general , if you do n't need to query across the data use a denormalized approach to avoid extra queries. User settings are a pretty good example ! </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>If you do n't need to query by any of this extra data , then you can store it as a serialized dictionary. Use repr to turn the dictionary into a string , and eval to turn the string back into a dictionary. Take care with eval that there 's no user data in the dictionary , or use a safe_eval implementation . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>Beeing " not equal to all instances of the model " sounds to me like a good match for a " Schema-free database " . CouchDB is the poster child for that approach and you might consider that . </p>
<p>In a project I moved several tables which never played very nice with the Django ORM over to CouchDB and I 'm quite happy with that. I use couchdb-python without any of the Django-specific CouchDB modules. A description of the data model can be found here . The movement from five " models " in Django to 3 " models " in Django and one CouchDB " database " actually slightly reduced the total lines of code in my application . </p>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>I agree that you need to refrain stuffing otherwise structured data into a single column. But if you must do that , Django has an XMLField build-in . </p>
<p>There 's also JSONField at Django snipplets . </p>
<br /><b># 8 </b><br /><p>I came to this post by <span style="background-color:yellow;">google</span> 's 4rth result to " django store object " </p>
<p>A little bit late , but django-picklefield looks like good solution to me . </p>
<p>Example from doc : </p>
<p>To use , just define a field in your model : </p>
<pre><code>>>> from picklefield.fields import PickledObjectField
>>> class SomeObject(models.Model):
>>>     args = PickledObjectField()
</code></pre>
<p>and assign whatever you like ( as long as it 's picklable ) to the field : </p>
<pre><code>>>> obj = SomeObject()
>>> obj.args = ['fancy', {'objects': 'inside'}]
>>> obj.save()
</code></pre>
