<h3>Question ( ID-2439968 ) : </h3><h2>How to remove lowercase sentence fragments from text ? </h2><p>I 'm tyring to remove lowercase sentence fragments from standard text files using regular expresions or a simple Perl oneliner . </p>
<p>These are commonly referred to as speech or attribution tags , for example - he said , she said , etc . </p>
<p>This example shows before and after using <span style="background-color:yellow;">manual</span> deletion : </p>
<ol>Original : </ol>
<p>" Ah , that 's perfectly true ! " exclaimed Alyosha . </p>
<p>" Oh , do leave off playing the fool ! Some idiot comes in , and you put us to shame ! " cried the girl by the window , suddenly turning to her father with a disdainful and contemptuous air . </p>
<p>" Wait a little , Varvara ! " cried her father , speaking peremptorily but looking at them quite approvingly. " That 's her character , " he said , addressing Alyosha again . </p>
<p>" Where have you been ? " he asked him . </p>
<p>" I think , " he said , " I 've forgotten something... <span style="background-color:yellow;">my</span> handkerchief , I think.... Well , even if I 've not forgotten anything , let <span style="background-color:yellow;">me</span> stay a little. " </p>
<p>He sat down. Father stood over him . </p>
<p>" You sit down , too , " said he . </p>
<hr />
<ol>All lower case sentence fragments <span style="background-color:yellow;">manually</span> removed : </ol>
<p>" Ah , that 's perfectly true ! " </p>
<p>" Oh , do leave off playing the fool ! Some idiot comes in , and you put us to shame ! " </p>
<p>" Wait a little , Varvara ! " " That 's her character , " </p>
<p>" Where have you been ? " </p>
<p>" I think , " " I 've forgotten something... <span style="background-color:yellow;">my</span> handkerchief , I think.... Well , even if I 've not forgotten anything , let <span style="background-color:yellow;">me</span> stay a little. " </p>
<p>He sat down. Father stood over him . </p>
<p>" You sit down , too , " </p>
<hr />
<p></p>
<p>Of course , this removes some fragments but deletes some text in balanced quotes and text starting with uppercase letters. [ ^ A-Z ] did n't work in the above expression . </p>
<p>I realize that it <span style="background-color:yellow;">may</span> be impossible to achieve 100 % accuracy but any useful expression , perl , or python script would be deeply appreciated . </p>
<p>Cheers, </p>

<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-6 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>Here 's a Python snippet that should do : </p>
<pre><code> thetext="""triple quoted paste of your sample text"""
 y=thetext.split('\n')
 for line in y:
    m=re.findall('(".*?")',line)
    if m:
        print ' '.join(m)
    else:
        print line
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>The Text : : Balanced <span style="background-color:yellow;">module</span> is what you seem to be after if you 're looking to use Perl. The following should be able to extract all the quoted speech in your example ( not pretty , but gets the job done ) . </p>
<p>It also works for Dennis ' test cases . </p>
<p>The advantage of the code below is that the quotes are grouped by paragraph , which <span style="background-color:yellow;">may</span> or <span style="background-color:yellow;">may</span> not be useful for later analysis </p>
<p>Script </p>
<pre><code>use strict;
use warnings;
use Text::Balanced qw/extract_quotelike extract_multiple/;

my %quotedSpeech;

{
    local $/ = '';
    while (my $text = <DATA>) { # one paragraph at a time

        while (my $speech = extract_multiple(
                            $text,
                            [sub{extract_quotelike($_[0])},],
                            undef,
                            1))
        {   push @{$quotedSpeech{$.}}, $speech; }
    }
}

# Print total number of paragraphs in DATA filehandle

print "Total paragraphs: ", (sort {$a <=> $b} keys %quotedSpeech)[-1];

# Print quotes grouped by paragraph:

foreach my $paraNumber (sort {$a <=> $b} keys %quotedSpeech) {
    print "\n\nPara ",$paraNumber;
    foreach my $speech (@{$quotedSpeech{$paraNumber}}) {
        print "\t",$speech,"\n";
    }
}
# How many quotes in paragraph 8?
print "Number of quotes in Paragraph 8: ", scalar @{$quotedSpeech{8}};

Para 1  "Ah, that's perfectly true!"


Para 2  "Oh, do leave off playing the fool! Some idiot comes in, and you put us
to shame!"


Para 3  "Wait a little, Varvara!"
        "That's her character,"

        "I've forgotten something... my handkerchief, I think.... Well, even if
I've not forgotten anything, let me stay a little."

Para 8  "It doesn't always work."

Para 10 "That's right."

<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>I am not entirely sure which editor are you using , if you are using something editor that supports atomic grouping ( e.g. EditorPad Pro ) You can use the regular expression below to do the search and replace : </p>
<p>Search for </p>
<pre><code>(".+?"|^[A-Z].+\r\n)(.(?!"))* 
Note: you should replace \r\n with \n or \r according to your line breaks
</code></pre>
<p>Replace with </p>
<pre><code>\1
</code></pre>
<p>Here is a bit explanation for the regular expression : </p>
<blockquote>The first capturing group is for characters between quotes and lines starting with Capital Letters. The second capturing group is for any characters that is after a quote but before another quote . </blockquote>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>This works for all cases shown in the question : </p>
<pre><code>sed -n '/"/!{p;b}; s/\(.*\)"[^"]*/\1" /;s/\(.*"\)\([^"]*\)\(".*"\)/\1 \3/;p' textfile
</code></pre>
<p>It fails for cases such as these : </p>
<pre><code>He said, "It doesn't always work."

"Secondly," I said, "it fails for three quoted phrases..." He completed my thought, "with two unquoted ones."

I replied, "That's right." dejectedly.

<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>If I understand what you are after... passing each line through a regex like this should work.. . </p>
<p>You can use the perl debugger to play around with this. Hop into the perl debugger with just a perl -de 42 on the command line in linux/mac. ( The " 42 " is just a valid expression - it could be anything , but why not choose the <span style="background-color:yellow;">meaning</span> of life ? ) </p>
<p>anyways </p>
<pre><code>open FILE, "<", "filename.txt" or die $!;
while (my $line = <FILE>) {
   @fixed_text = $line =~ m{(?:(" .+? ")) | (?:\A .* [^"] .* \z)}xmsg;
  for my $new_line (@fixed_text) {
    print qq($new_line );
  }
  print qq(\n);
}
</code></pre>
<p>NOTE : Sorry I had to edit it - did n't see you wanted lines without any quotes at all.. . </p>
<p>Yes , Regex and Perl is amazing. It should be 100 % accurate and get all of your instances , acept in the case where a quote extends across paragraphs </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>I forgot to <span style="background-color:yellow;">mention</span> that I 'm running Perl and Python on a pc. I 'm using Textpipe for regex . </p>
<p>I get the following error <span style="background-color:yellow;">message</span> when running the Perl script. The example file " text " is in the same BIN directory. I 've had to <span style="background-color:yellow;">make</span> some changes to linux perl scripts before. Should I be using different syntax ? Thanks to everyone for their contributions. I 'll try the python script next </p>
<p>C : \ PERL \ BIN&gt ; perl script.pl " text " Name " <span style="background-color:yellow;">main</span> : : DATA " used only once : possible typo at script.pl line 10 . readline ( ) on unopened filehandle DATA at script.pl line 10 . </p>
