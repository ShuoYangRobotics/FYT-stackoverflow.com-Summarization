<h3>Question ( ID-653509 ) : </h3><h2>Breaking out of nested loops </h2><p>Is there an easier way to break out of nested loops than throwing an exception ? ( In Perl , you can give labels to each loop and at least continue an outer loop. ) </p>
<pre><code>for x in range(10):
    for y in range(10):
        print x*y
        if x*y > 50:
            "break both loops"
</code></pre>
<p>I.e. , is there a nicer way than : </p>
<pre><code>class BreakIt(Exception): pass

try:
    for x in range(10):
        for y in range(10):
            print x*y
            if x*y > 50:
                raise BreakIt
except BreakIt:
    pass

<p>The same works for deeper loops : </p>
<pre><code>for x in xrange(10):
    for y in xrange(10):
        for z in xrange(10):
            print x,y,z
            if x*y*z == 30:
                break
        else:
            continue
        break
    else:
        continue
    break

<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>It has at least been suggested , but also rejected . I do n't think there is another way , short of repeating the test or re-organizing the code. It is sometimes a bit annoying . </p>
<p>In the rejection message , Mr van Rossum mentions using return , which is really sensible and something I need to remember personally. : ) </p>

<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>You can also refactor your code to use a generator. But this may not be a solution for all types of nested loops . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Sometimes I use a boolean variable. Naive , if you want , but I find it quite flexible and comfortable to read. Testing a variable may avoid testing again complex conditions and may also collect results from several tests in inner loops . </p>
<pre><code>    x_loop_must_break = False
    for x in range(10):
        for y in range(10):
            print x*y
            if x*y > 50:
                x_loop_must_break = True
                break
        if x_loop_must_break: break

<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>In this particular case , you can merge the loops with a modern python ( 3.0 and probably 2.6 , too ) by using <span style="background-color:yellow;">itertools.product</span> . </p>
<p>I for myself took this as a rule of thumb , if you nest too many loops ( as in , more than 2 ) , you are usually able to extract one of the loops into a different method or merge the loops into one , as in this case . </p>
