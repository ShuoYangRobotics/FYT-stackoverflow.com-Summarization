<h3>Question ( ID-1319254 ) : </h3><h2>What is the most efficient way to <span style="background-color:yellow;">add</span> an element to a list only if is n't there yet ? </h2><p>I have the following code in Python : </p>
<pre><code>def point_to_index(point):
    if point not in points:
        points.append(point)
    return points.index(point)
</code></pre>
<p>This code is awfully inefficient , especially since I expect <span style="background-color:yellow;">points</span> to grow to hold a few million elements . </p>
<p>If the <span style="background-color:yellow;">point</span> is n't in the list , I traverse the list 3 times : </p>
<ol>look for it and decide it is n't there go to the end of the list and <span style="background-color:yellow;">add</span> a new element go to the end of the list until I find the index </ol>
<p>If it is in the list , I traverse it twice : <span style="background-color:yellow;">1.</span> look for it and decide it is there 2. go almost to the end of the list until I find the index </p>
<p>Is there any more efficient way to do this ? For instance , I know that : </p>
<ul>I 'm more likely to call this function with a <span style="background-color:yellow;">point</span> that is n't in the list . If the <span style="background-color:yellow;">point</span> is in the list , it 's likelier to be near the end than in the beginning . </ul>
<p>So if I could have the line : </p>
<pre><code>if point not in points:
</code></pre>
<p>search the list from the end to the beginning it would improve performance when the <span style="background-color:yellow;">point</span> is already in the list . </p>
<p>However , I do n't want to do : </p>
<pre><code>if point not in reversed(points):
</code></pre>
<p>because I imagine that <span style="background-color:yellow;">reversed</span> ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">points</span> ) itself will come at a huge cost . </p>
<p>Nor do I want to <span style="background-color:yellow;">add</span> new <span style="background-color:yellow;">points</span> to the beginning of the list ( assuming I knew how to do that in Python ) because that would change the indices , which must remain constant for the algorithm to work . </p>
<p>The only improvement I can think of is to implement the function with only one pass , if possible from the end to the beginning. The bottom line is : </p>
<ul>Is there a good way to do this ? Is there a better way to optimize the function ? </ul>
<p>Edit : I 've gotten suggestions for implementing this with only one pass. Is there any way for index ( ) to go from the end to the beginning ? </p>
<p>Edit : People have asked why the index is critical. I 'm trying to describe a 3D surface using the OFF file format . This format describes a surface using its vertices and faces. First the vertices are listed , and the faces are described using a list of indices of vertices. That 's why once I <span style="background-color:yellow;">add</span> a vortex to the list , its index must not change . </p>
<p>Edit : There have been some suggestions ( such as igor 's ) to use a dict. This is a good solution for scanning the list. However , when I 'm done I need to print out the list in the same order it was created. If I use a dict , I need to print out its keys sorted by value. Is there a good way to do that ? </p>
<p>Edit : I implemented www.brool.com 's suggestion . This was the simplest and fastest. It is essentially an ordered Dict , but without the overhead. The performance is great ! </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-6 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>This will traverse at most once : </p>
<pre><code>def point_to_index(point):
    try: 
        return points.index(point)
    except ValueError:
        points.append(point)
        return len(points)-1
</code></pre>
<p>You may also want to try this version , which takes into account that matches are likely to be near the end of the list. Note that <span style="background-color:yellow;">reversed</span> ( ) has almost no cost even on very large lists - it does not create a copy and does not traverse the list more than once . </p>
<pre><code>def point_to_index(point):
    for index, this_point in enumerate(reversed(points)):
        if point == this_point:
            return len(points) - (index+1)
    else:
        points.append(point)
        return len(points)-1
</code></pre>
<p>You might also consider keeping a parallel dict or set of <span style="background-color:yellow;">points</span> to check for membership , since both of those types can do membership tests in O ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">1</span> ) . There would be , of course , a substantial memory cost . </p>
<p>Obviously , if the <span style="background-color:yellow;">points</span> were ordered somehow , you would have many other options for speeding this code up , notably using a binary search for membership tests . </p>
<br /><b># <span style="background-color:yellow;">1</span> </b><br /><p>You want to use a set : </p>
<pre><code>>>> x = set()
>>> x
set([])
>>> x.add(1)
>>> x
set([1])
>>> x.add(1)
>>> x
set([1])
</code></pre>
<p>A set contains only one instance of any item you <span style="background-color:yellow;">add</span> , and it will be a lot more efficient than iterating a list manually . </p>
<p>This wikibooks page looks like a good primer if you have n't used sets in Python before . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>If you 're worried about memory usage , but want to optimize the common case , keep a dictionary with the last n <span style="background-color:yellow;">points</span> and their indexes. <span style="background-color:yellow;">points_dict</span> = dictionary , max_cache = size of the cache . </p>
<pre><code>def point_to_index(point):
    try:
        return points_dict.get(point, points.index(point))
    except:
        if len(points) >= max_cache:
            del points_dict[points[len(points)-max_cache]]
        points.append(point)
        points_dict[points] = len(points)-1
        return len(points)-1
</code></pre>

<p>Update : Added in Nathan 's exception code . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>As others said , consider using set or dict. You do n't explain why you need the indices. If they are needed only to assign unique ids to the <span style="background-color:yellow;">points</span> ( and I ca n't easily come up with another reason for using them ) , then dict will indeed work much better , e.g., </p>
<pre><code>points = {}
def point_to_index(point):
    if point in points:
        return points[point]
    else:
       points[point] = len(points)
       return len(points) - 1
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>What you really want is an ordered dict ( key insertion determines the order ) : </p>
