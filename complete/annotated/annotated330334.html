<h3>Question ( ID-330334 ) : </h3><h2>Parsing a string for nested patterns </h2><p>What would be the best way to <span style="background-color:yellow;">do</span> this . </p>
<p>The input string is </p>
<pre><code><133_3><135_3><116_2>The other system worked for about 1 month</116_2> got some good images <137_3>on it then it started doing the same thing as the first one</137_3> so then I quit using either camera now they are just sitting and collecting dust.</135_3></133_3>
</code></pre>
<p>the expected output is </p>
<pre><code>{'The other system worked for about 1 month got some good images on it then it started doing the same thing as the first one so then I quit \
using either camera now they are just sitting and collecting dust.':[133, 135],

'The other system worked for about 1 month': [116],

'on it then it started doing the same thing as the first one':[137]

}

<p>that seems like a <span style="background-color:yellow;">recursive</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">regexp</span> search but I ca n't figure out how exactly . </p>
<p>I can think of a tedious <span style="background-color:yellow;">recursive</span> function as of now , but have a feeling that there should be a better way . </p>
<p>Related question : Can <span style="background-color:yellow;">regular</span> expressions be used to match nested patterns ? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-6 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>Take an XML parser , make it generate a DOM ( Document Object Model ) and then build a <span style="background-color:yellow;">recursive</span> algorithm that traverses all the nodes , calls " <span style="background-color:yellow;">text</span> ( ) " in each node ( that should give you the <span style="background-color:yellow;">text</span> in the current node and all children ) and puts that as a key in the <span style="background-color:yellow;">dictionary</span> . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>Use expat or another XML parser ; it 's more explicit than anything else , considering you 're <span style="background-color:yellow;">dealing</span> with XML <span style="background-color:yellow;">data</span> anyway . </p>
<p>However , note that XML element <span style="background-color:yellow;">names</span> ca n't start with a number as your example has them . </p>
<p>Here 's a parser that will <span style="background-color:yellow;">do</span> what you need , although you 'll need to tweak it to combine <span style="background-color:yellow;">duplicate</span> elements into one <span style="background-color:yellow;">dict</span> key : </p>
<pre><code>from xml.parsers.expat import ParserCreate

open_elements = {}
result_dict = {}

def start_element(name, attrs):
    open_elements[name] = True

def end_element(name):
    del open_elements[name]

def char_data(data):
    for element in open_elements:
        cur = result_dict.setdefault(element, '')
        result_dict[element] = cur + data

if __name__ == '__main__':
    p = ParserCreate()

    p.StartElementHandler = start_element
    p.EndElementHandler = end_element
    p.CharacterDataHandler = char_data

    p.Parse(u'<_133_3><_135_3><_116_2>The other system worked for about 1 month</_116_2> got some good images <_137_3>on it then it started doing the same thing as the first one</_137_3> so then I quit using either camera now they are just sitting and collecting dust.</_135_3></_133_3>', 1)

<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>I think a grammar would be the best option here. I found a link with some information : http : //www.onlamp.com/pub/a/python/2006/01/26/pyparsing.html </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Note that you ca n't actually solve this by a <span style="background-color:yellow;">regular</span> expression , since they <span style="background-color:yellow;">do</span> n't have the expressive power to enforce proper nesting . </p>
<p>Take the following mini-language : </p>
<blockquote>A certain number of " ( " followed by the same number of " ) " , no matter what the number . </blockquote>
<p>You could make a <span style="background-color:yellow;">regular</span> expression very easily to <span style="background-color:yellow;">represent</span> a super-language of this mini-language ( where you <span style="background-color:yellow;">do</span> n't enforce the equality of the number of starts parentheses and end parentheses ) . You could also make a <span style="background-color:yellow;">regular</span> expression very easilty to <span style="background-color:yellow;">represent</span> any finite sub-language ( where you limit yourself to some max <span style="background-color:yellow;">depth</span> of nesting ) . But you can never <span style="background-color:yellow;">represent</span> this exact language in a <span style="background-color:yellow;">regular</span> expression . </p>
<p>So you 'd have to use a grammar , yes . </p>
