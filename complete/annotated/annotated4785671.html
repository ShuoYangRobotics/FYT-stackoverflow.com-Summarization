<h3>Question ( ID-4785671 ) : </h3><h2>Reading from a text file </h2><p>I 'm not looking for an answer here but rather a guideline of how I should be approaching this task . </p>
<p>I have a txt file that contains the following information : </p>
<pre><code>...
    1947q2        -0.6
    1947q3        -0.3
    1947q4         6.2
    1948q1         6.5
    1948q2         7.6
    1948q3         2.2
    1948q4         0.6
...
</code></pre>
<p>My objective is to be able to <span style="background-color:yellow;">read</span> the text file based on a keyword selection. For example I want to <span style="background-color:yellow;">read</span> the <span style="background-color:yellow;">lines</span> that contain only 1947 so the output would be like : </p>
<pre><code>    1947q2        -0.6
    1947q3        -0.3
    1947q4         6.2
</code></pre>
<p>Because the numbers are tied to each year , I was thinking of putting each row in a tuple then combining all the tuples into a list. From this list , use <span style="background-color:yellow;">regular</span> expressions to search the list to get the tuples that match and print them out accordingly . </p>
<p>Is this an acceptable way to do it ? Is there a simpler more obvious solution to this ? Not <span style="background-color:yellow;">really</span> looking for the optimal method but rather different ideas on how to approach this problem . </p>

    sys.stdout.write(line)

<p>You can also parse each <span style="background-color:yellow;">line</span> in the body of the for loop and then decide whether to accept it. If you want to get fancy , have a look at map and filter . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>One thing you can do is to use generators to filter out members of the list dynamically using a similar method to what you have done already : </p>
<pre><code>data = open("file.txt")
fortysevens = (line for line in data if contains_47(line))
for line in fortysevens:
    # do something here

def contains_47(line):
    # your existing code here to detect if a line contains 47
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>Is your keyword always going to be the year ? If so , I would store them in a dictionary like this : </p>
<pre><code>mydata[year][quarter] = value
</code></pre>
<p>So you could get to your example data via mydata [ '1947 ' ] . </p>
<p>To <span style="background-color:yellow;">read</span> the file , you might want to use csv.reader , then split the first column on 'q ' to get the year and quarter individually . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>I 'd write code that took all of the <span style="background-color:yellow;">lines</span> in the function <span style="background-color:yellow;">returned</span> a sequence of tuples like ( 1947 , 3 , -7.0 ) . Then its a simple iteration over the <span style="background-color:yellow;">result</span> to figure out which ones I <span style="background-color:yellow;">really</span> want . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>If the data in the <span style="background-color:yellow;">lines</span> of the input file are fixed -- as they appear to be -- then something as simple as this would work : </p>
<pre><code>with open('data.txt') as data:
    for line in data:
        if line[4:8] == '1947':
            print line,

# output:
#     1947q2        -0.6
#     1947q3        -0.3
#     1947q4         6.2
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the <span style="background-color:yellow;">reason</span> I used print <span style="background-color:yellow;">line</span> , is because each <span style="background-color:yellow;">line</span> string ends with a newline . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>As far as I know , <span style="background-color:yellow;">regexes</span> have been invented for this kind of job . </p>
<p>A <span style="background-color:yellow;">regex</span> will search directly the " <span style="background-color:yellow;">lines</span> containing the keyword " . A <span style="background-color:yellow;">regex</span> 's search can also be based on more complex conditions that will be expressed in a more condensed code than with use of a clumsy " for <span style="background-color:yellow;">line</span> in f " loop . </p>
<p>My motto is : " There are no <span style="background-color:yellow;">lines</span> " in a text file. It 's only a sequence of characters . </p>
<p>What a " for <span style="background-color:yellow;">line</span> in f " loop do is to analyse a stream of data to detect the newlines and stop at them : that is a first detection. Then on each <span style="background-color:yellow;">line</span> found , one ( or more ) simple ( or complex ) condition ( s ) must be tested on each <span style="background-color:yellow;">line</span> detected : that is a second <span style="background-color:yellow;">research</span> . </p>
<p>On the other hand , a <span style="background-color:yellow;">regex</span> finds directly what is searched , without preliminary searching the newlines. Condition of a <span style="background-color:yellow;">line</span> and condition of a keyword in the <span style="background-color:yellow;">line</span> are tested at the same time . </p>
<pre><code>import re

keyw = '1947'
pat = re.compile('.*?' + keyw + '.*')

with open('thefile.txt','r') as f:
    keyworded_lines = pat.findall(f.read())

# do what you need with keyworded_lines
</code></pre>
<p>Note that in 'r ' mode Python transforms all the newlines in ' \ n'. Since the point in a RE does n't match ' \ n ' , the RE needs only '. * ' after the keyw . </p>
