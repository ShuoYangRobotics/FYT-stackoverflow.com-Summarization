<h3>Question ( ID-5703612 ) : </h3><h2>How do you model a <span style="background-color:yellow;">state</span> with three values ? </h2><p>I have something which can be in three <span style="background-color:yellow;">states</span> </p>
<p>( say ) Open , Closed , Running </p>
<p>I will try to model it via one of the two ways, </p>
<pre><code>is_open = Boolean(default=False)
is_running = Boolean(default=False)
</code></pre>
<p>and Disallow the <span style="background-color:yellow;">state</span> ( say ) is_running = True , is_open = False in application code . </p>
<p>I can also try </p>
<pre><code>state=Char(choices=("O", "C", "R"))
</code></pre>
<p>Is one of the ways better , and is there any better way to do this ? </p>
<p>Edit : I am using Python ( and Django ) . Edit 2 : After reading the answers below , I guess I am trying to simulate Enums in Python ( Which doesnt have them ) in a form which is suitable for persisting to DB </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-6 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>The elusive " Tri-boolean " value. I 've seen this before somewhere . </p>
<pre><code>enum Bool 
{ 
    True, 
    False, 
    FileNotFound 
};
</code></pre>

<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>Depending on your language , you may be able to use an enum : </p>
<pre><code>enum DoohickyState
{
    Open,
    Closed,
    Running
}
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>actually you need only two , cause in your case : </p>
<pre><code>closed = ! open
</code></pre>
<p>And this depends if only one of the three or evntually more than one can be valid at once , like <span style="background-color:yellow;">open</span> and running together ? if its only one <span style="background-color:yellow;">state</span> allowed at once i would use Enumerations </p>
<p>As this issue is in Python which doesnt support Enums i suggest to take a look at : What& # <span style="background-color:yellow;">39</span> ; s the best way to implement an & # <span style="background-color:yellow;">39</span> ; enum& # <span style="background-color:yellow;">39</span> ; in Python ? All 1st Four answers are interesting but i prefere the 1st and <span style="background-color:yellow;">3rd</span> ones , the one from Alexandru Nedelcu : </p>
<pre><code>class State:
    OPEN=1
    CLOSED=2
    RUNNING=3
</code></pre>
<p>Or the answer of Mark Harrison like : </p>
<pre><code>OPEN, CLOSED, RUNNING = range(3)
</code></pre>
<br /><b># <span style="background-color:yellow;">3</span> </b><br /><p>The simplest way to handle this in Python is to use string constants. We did exactly that when adding inspect.getgeneratorstate ( ) to Python <span style="background-color:yellow;">3.2.</span> The possible return values from that function are : </p>
<pre><code>GEN_CREATED = 'GEN_CREATED'
GEN_RUNNING = 'GEN_RUNNING'
GEN_SUSPENDED = 'GEN_SUSPENDED'
GEN_CLOSED = 'GEN_CLOSED'
</code></pre>
<p>Creating a simple class as a namespace for the constants is another common option ( but the attributes of that class should still be strings rather than integers ) . </p>
<p>In Python , there is minimal gain in using integers over strings for your constants. You lose a little in comparison speed ( but not much , due to hash caching and other string comparison optimisations ) and use slightly more memory ( but not much , since references are the same size regardless of the type of the target ) , but vastly simplify debugging ( since you do n't need to translate integer codes to meaningful <span style="background-color:yellow;">state</span> names - you can just display the string values ) . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>+ 1 for suggestions you probably want an enum. Since python does n't support them , I 'd probably define a class to encapsulate it. That way you can enforce rules on update. As a minimum that 'll give you the same behaviour as an enum. If appropriate you can also control legal <span style="background-color:yellow;">state</span> changes , e.g . </p>
<pre><code>class Widget:
    def __init__(self, state="Closed"):
        self.state=state

    def open(self):
        if self.state == "Closed":
            self.state = "Open"
        elif self.state == "Open":
            pass
        else:
            # do whatever if trying to open in "Running" state...

    def close(self):
        # etc.

class ThingContainingWidget:
    def __init__(self):
        self.widget=Widget()

    def doSomethingThatAffectsWidget(self):
        self.widget.close()
        # etc.
</code></pre>
<p>Depending on the problem , you may need/want to move the <span style="background-color:yellow;">state</span> change logic to the enclosing class ( e.g. if <span style="background-color:yellow;">state</span> behaviour is dependent on other attributes of enclosing class too ) . But I 'd probably leave the basic validation ( ensuring value can only ever be Open/Closed/Running ) in the <span style="background-color:yellow;">Widget</span> class . </p>
<p>Have n't done any django in a while , but ca n't think of any reason why this would n't work . </p>

<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>This is a good place to make use of Python " properties " - which allow you to bind get and set methods to <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> attributes in a transparent way . </p>
<p>That way , your methods can control the behavior you want , and your code just have to set True or False for your <span style="background-color:yellow;">states</span> : </p>
<pre><code>class Machine(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.open = False
        self._running = False
        self._closed = False

    def get_running(self):
     return self._running

    def set_running(self, val):
        if not self.open and val:
            raise ValueError("Cannot run if it is closed")
        self._running = True

    running = property(get_running, set_running)

    def get_closed(self):
        return self._closed

    def set_closed(self, val):
        if val:
            self.open = False
            self.running = False
        self._closed = val

    closed = property(get_closed, set_closed)
</code></pre>
<p>Pasting this on the python console allows for a quick test drive : </p>
<pre><code>>>> m = Machine()
>>> m.open
False
>>> m.running
False
>>> m.running = True
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "<stdin>", line 12, in set_running
ValueError: Cannot run if it is closed
>>> m.open = True
>>> m.running = True
>>> m.closed
False
>>> m.closed = True
>>> m.open, m.running
(False, True)
>>>
