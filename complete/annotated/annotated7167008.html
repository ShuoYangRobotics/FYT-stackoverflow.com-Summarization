<h3>Question ( ID-7167008 ) : </h3><h2>Efficiently finding the last line in a text <span style="background-color:yellow;">file</span> </h2><p>I need to extract the last line from a number of very large ( several hundred megabyte ) text <span style="background-color:yellow;">files</span> to get certain data. Currently , I am using python to cycle through all the lines until the <span style="background-color:yellow;">file</span> is empty and then I process the last line returned , but I am certain there is a more efficient way to do this . </p>
<p>What is the best way to retrieve just the last line of a text <span style="background-color:yellow;">file</span> using python ? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-10 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>You could take a look at : Get last n lines of a <span style="background-color:yellow;">file</span> with Python , similar to tail </p>
<p>It is really close to what you need . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>Use the <span style="background-color:yellow;">file</span> 's <span style="background-color:yellow;">seek</span> method with a negative offset and whence = <span style="background-color:yellow;">os.SEEK_END</span> to read a block from the end of the <span style="background-color:yellow;">file.</span> Search that block for the last line end character ( s ) and grab all the characters after it. If there is no line end , back up farther and repeat the process . </p>
<pre><code>def last_line(in_file, block_size=1024, ignore_ending_newline=False):
    suffix = ""
    in_file.seek(0, os.SEEK_END)
    in_file_length = in_file.tell()
    seek_offset = 0

    while(-seek_offset < in_file_length):
        # Read from end.
        seek_offset -= block_size
        if -seek_offset > in_file_length:
            # Limit if we ran out of file (can't seek backward from start).
            block_size -= -seek_offset - in_file_length
            if block_size == 0:
                break
            seek_offset = -in_file_length
        in_file.seek(seek_offset, os.SEEK_END)
        buf = in_file.read(block_size)

        # Search for line end.
        if ignore_ending_newline and seek_offset == -block_size and buf[-1] == '\n':
            buf = buf[:-1]
        pos = buf.rfind('\n')
        if pos != -1:
            # Found line end.
            return buf[pos+1:] + suffix

        suffix = buf + suffix

    # One-line file.
    return suffix

<p>Note that this will not work on things that do n't support <span style="background-color:yellow;">seek</span> , like stdin or sockets. In those cases , you 're stuck reading the whole thing ( like the tail command does ) . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>Not the straight forward way , but probably much faster than a simple Python implementation : </p>
<pre><code>line = subprocess.check_output(['tail', '-1', filename])
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>If you do know the maximal length of a line , you can do </p>
<pre><code>def getLastLine(fname, maxLineLength=80):
    fp=file(fname, "rb")
    fp.seek(-maxLineLength-1, 2) # 2 means "from the end of the file"
    return fp.readlines()[-1]
</code></pre>
<p>This works on my windows machine. But I do not know what happens on other platforms if you open a text <span style="background-color:yellow;">file</span> in binary mode. The binary mode is needed if you want to use <span style="background-color:yellow;">seek</span> ( ) . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Seek to the end of the <span style="background-color:yellow;">file</span> minus 100 bytes or so. Do a read and search for a newline. If here is no newline , <span style="background-color:yellow;">seek</span> back another 100 bytes or so. Lather , rinse , repeat. Eventually you 'll find a newline. The last line begins immediately after that newline . </p>
<p>Best case scenario you only do one read of 100 bytes . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>If you can pick a reasonable maximum line length , you can <span style="background-color:yellow;">seek</span> to nearly the end of the <span style="background-color:yellow;">file</span> before you start reading . </p>
<pre><code>myfile.seek(-max_line_length, os.SEEK_END)
line = myfile.readlines()[-1]
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>You should n't have to loop through all the lines. Can you just read the <span style="background-color:yellow;">files</span> into a list and index the last line ? </p>
<p>I found this example : </p>
<p>http : //www.daniweb.com/software-development/python/threads/121557 </p>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>Could you load the <span style="background-color:yellow;">file</span> into a mmap , then use mmap.rfind ( string [ , start [ , end ] ] ) to find the second last EOL character in the <span style="background-color:yellow;">file</span> ? A <span style="background-color:yellow;">seek</span> to that point in the <span style="background-color:yellow;">file</span> should point you to the last line I would think . </p>
<br /><b># 8 </b><br /><p>The inefficiency here is not really due to Python , but to the nature of how <span style="background-color:yellow;">files</span> are read. The only way to find the last line is to read the <span style="background-color:yellow;">file</span> in and find the line endings. However , the <span style="background-color:yellow;">seek</span> operation may be used to skip to any byte offset in the <span style="background-color:yellow;">file.</span> You can , therefore begin very close to the end of the <span style="background-color:yellow;">file</span> , and grab larger and larger chunks as needed until the last line ending is found : </p>
<pre><code>from os import SEEK_END

def get_last_line(file):
  CHUNK_SIZE = 1024 # Would be good to make this the chunk size of the filesystem

  last_line = ""

  while True:
    # We grab chunks from the end of the file towards the beginning until we 
    # get a new line
    file.seek(-len(last_line) - CHUNK_SIZE, SEEK_END)
    chunk = file.read(CHUNK_SIZE)

    if not chunk:
      # The whole file is one big line
      return last_line

    if not last_line and chunk.endswith('\n'):
      # Ignore the trailing newline at the end of the file (but include it 
      # in the output).
      last_line = '\n'
      chunk = chunk[:-1]

    nl_pos = chunk.rfind('\n')
    # What's being searched for will have to be modified if you are searching
    # files with non-unix line endings.

    last_line = chunk[nl_pos + 1:] + last_line

    if nl_pos == -1:
      # The whole chunk is part of the last line.
      continue

    return last_line

<br /><b># 9 </b><br /><pre><code>lines = file.readlines()
