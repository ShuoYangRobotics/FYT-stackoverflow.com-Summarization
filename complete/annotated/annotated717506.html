<h3>Question ( ID-717506 ) : </h3><h2>If monkey patching is permitted in both Ruby and Python , why is it more controversial in Ruby ? </h2><p>In many discussions I have heard about Ruby in which people have expressed their reservations about the language , the issue of monkey patching comes up as one of their primary concerns . </p>
<p>However , I rarely hear the same arguments made in the context of Python although it is also permitted in the Python language . </p>
<p>Why this distinction ? </p>
<p>Does Python include different types of safeguards to minimize the risks of this feature ? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-8 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>It 's a technique less practised in Python , in part because " core " classes in Python ( those implemented in C ) are <span style="background-color:yellow;">not</span> really modifiable. In Ruby , on the other hand , because of the way it 's implemented <span style="background-color:yellow;">internally</span> ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">not</span> better , just different ) just about anything can be modified dynamically . </p>
<p>Philosophically , it 's something that tends to be frowned on within the Python community , distinctly less so in the Ruby world. I do <span style="background-color:yellow;">n't</span> know why you assert that it 's more controversial ( can you link to an authoritative reference ? ) - my experience has been that monkey-patching is an accepted technique if one where the user should be aware of possible consequences . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>The languages might permit it , but <span style="background-color:yellow;">neither</span> community condones the practice. Monkeypatching is <span style="background-color:yellow;">n't</span> condoned in either language , but you hear about it more often in Ruby because the form of open class it uses makes it very , very easy to monkeypatch a class and because of this , it 's more acceptable in the Ruby community , but still frowned upon . Monkeypatching simply is <span style="background-color:yellow;">n't</span> as prevalent or as easy in Python , which is why you wo <span style="background-color:yellow;">n't</span> hear the same arguments against it in that community. Python does <span style="background-color:yellow;">nothing</span> that Ruby does <span style="background-color:yellow;">n't</span> do to prevent the practice . </p>
<p>The reason you hear/read about it more often in Ruby is that this in Ruby : </p>
<pre><code>class MyClass
  def foo
    puts "foo"
  end
end

class MyClass
  def bar
    puts "bar"
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>Will give you a class that contains two methods , <span style="background-color:yellow;">foo</span> and <span style="background-color:yellow;">bar</span> , whereas this in Python : </p>
<pre><code>class MyClass:
    def foo(self):
        print "foo"

class MyClass:
    def bar(self):
        print "bar"
</code></pre>
<p>Will leave you with a class that only contains the method <span style="background-color:yellow;">bar</span> as redefinition of a class clobbers the previous definition completely. That alone makes Ruby code much easier to monkeypatch than Python code . </p>
<br /><b># <span style="background-color:yellow;">2</span> </b><br /><p>" Does Python include different types of safeguards to minimize the risks of this feature ? " </p>
<p>Yes. The community refuses to do it. The safeguard is entirely social . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>As a Python programmer who has had a taste of Ruby ( and likes it ) , I think there is somewhat of an ironic parallel to when Python was beginning to become popular . </p>
<p>C and Java programmers would 'bash ' Python , stating that it was <span style="background-color:yellow;">n't</span> a real language , and that the dynamic <span style="background-color:yellow;">nature</span> of its types would be dangerous , and allow people to create 'bad ' code. As python became more popular , and the advantages of its rapid development time became apparent , <span style="background-color:yellow;">not</span> to mention the less verbose syntax : </p>
<pre><code>// Java
Person p = new Person();

# Python
p = Person()
</code></pre>
<p>we began to see some more dynamic features appear in later versions of Java. Autoboxing and -unboxing make it less troublesome to deal with primitives , and Generics allow us to code once and apply it to many types . </p>
<p>It was with some amusement that I saw one of the key flexible features of Ruby - Monkey Patching , being touted as dangerous by the Python crowd. Having started teaching Ruby to students this year , being able to 'fix ' the implementation of an existing class , even one that is part of the system is very powerful . </p>
<p>Sure , you can screw up badly and your program can crash. I can segfault in C pretty easily , too. And Java apps can die flaming death . </p>
<p>The truth is , I see Monkey Patching as the <span style="background-color:yellow;">next</span> step in dynamic and meta-programming. Funny , since it has been around since Smalltalk . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>In python , any literal ( " " , { } , 1.0 , etc ) creates an instance of the standard class , even if you tried to monkeypatch it and redefined the corresponding class in your <span style="background-color:yellow;">namespace</span> . </p>
<p>It just wo <span style="background-color:yellow;">n't</span> work how you <span style="background-color:yellow;">intended</span> : </p>
<pre><code>class str():
    # define your custom string type
    ...

a = "foo"      # still a real python string
a = str("foo") # only this uses your custom class
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>Actually in Python it 's a bit harder to modify basic types . </p>
<p>For example imagine , that you redefine <span style="background-color:yellow;">integer</span> . </p>
<p>Ruby : </p>
<pre><code>class Fixnum 
   def *(n)
      5 
   end 
end
</code></pre>
<p>Now <span style="background-color:yellow;">2</span> * <span style="background-color:yellow;">2</span> yields 5 . </p>
<p>Python : </p>
<pre><code>>>> class int(int):
    def __mul__(self, x):
    	return 5


>>> 2*2
4
>>> int(2)*int(2)
5
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>I think that monkey patching should only be used as the last solution . </p>
<p>Normally Python programmers know how a class or a method behave. They know that class xxx is doing things in a certain way . </p>
<p>When you monkey patch a class or a method , you are changing it 's behavior. Other Python programmers using this class can be very surprised if that class is behaving differently . </p>
<p>The <span style="background-color:yellow;">normal</span> way of doing things is subclassing. That way , other programmers know that they are using a different object. They can use the original class or the subclass if they choose to . </p>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>If you want to do some monkey patching in Python , it is relatively easy , as long as you are <span style="background-color:yellow;">not</span> modifying a built-in type ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">int</span> , float , <span style="background-color:yellow;">str</span> ) . </p>
<pre><code>class SomeClass:
    def foo(self):
        print "foo"

def tempfunc(self):
    print "bar"
SomeClass.bar = tempfunc
del tempfunc
</code></pre>
<p>This will add the <span style="background-color:yellow;">bar</span> method to <span style="background-color:yellow;">SomeClass</span> and even existing instances of that class can use that injected method . </p>
