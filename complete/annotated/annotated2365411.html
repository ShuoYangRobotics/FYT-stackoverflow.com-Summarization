<p>EDIT : </p>
<p>Decode the string you get back , using either the charset in the the appropriate meta tag in the response or in the Content-Type header , then <span style="background-color:yellow;">encode</span> . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>Can we get the actual value used for <span style="background-color:yellow;">link</span> ? </p>
<p>In addition , we usually encounter this problem here when we are trying to .encode ( ) an already <span style="background-color:yellow;">encoded</span> byte string. So you might try to decode it first as in </p>
<pre><code>html = urllib.urlopen(link).read()
unicode_str = html.decode(<source encoding>)
encoded_str = unicode_str.encode("utf8")
</code></pre>
<p>As an example : </p>
<pre><code>html = '\xa0'
encoded_str = html.encode("utf8")
</code></pre>
<p>Fails with </p>
<pre><code>UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xa0 in position 0: ordinal not in range(128)
</code></pre>
<p>While : </p>
<pre><code>html = '\xa0'
decoded_str = html.decode("windows-1252")
encoded_str = html.encode("utf8")
</code></pre>
<p>Succeeds without error. Do note that " windows-1252 " is something I used as an example . I got this from chardet and it had 0.5 confidence that it is right ! ( well , as given with a 1-character-length string , what do you expect ) You should change that to the encoding of the byte string returned from .urlopen ( ) .read ( ) to what applies to the content you retrieved . </p>
<p>Another problem I see there is that the .encode ( ) string method returns the modified string and does not modify the source in place. So it 's kind of useless to have self.response.out.write ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">html</span> ) as <span style="background-color:yellow;">html</span> is not the <span style="background-color:yellow;">encoded</span> string from <span style="background-color:yellow;">html.encode</span> ( if that is what you were originally aiming for ) . </p>
<p>As Ignacio suggested , check the source webpage for the actual encoding of the returned string from read ( ) . It 's either in one of the Meta tags or in the ContentType header in the response. Use that then as the parameter for .decode ( ) . </p>
<p>Do note however that it should not be assumed that other developers are responsible enough to make sure the header and/or meta character set declarations match the actual content. ( Which is a PITA , yeah , I should know , I was one of those before ) . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>You wrote " " " I assume that means the HTML contains some wrongly-formed attempt at unicode somewhere. " " " </p>
<p>The HTML is NOT expected to contain any kind of " attempt at unicode " , well-formed or not. It must of necessity contain Unicode characters <span style="background-color:yellow;">encoded</span> in some encoding , which is usually supplied up front ... look for " charset " . </p>
<p>You appear to be assuming that the charset is UTF-8 ... on what grounds ? The " \ <span style="background-color:yellow;">xA0</span> " byte that is shown in your error message indicates that you may have a single-byte charset e.g. cp1252 . </p>
<p>If you ca n't get any sense out of the declaration at the start of the HTML , try using chardet to find out what the likely encoding is . </p>
<p>Why have you tagged your question with " regex " ? </p>
<p>Update after you replaced your whole question with a non-question : </p>
<pre><code>html = urllib.urlopen(link).read()
# html refers to a str object. To get unicode, you need to find out
# how it is encoded, and decode it.

html.encode("utf8","ignore")
# problem 1: will fail because html is a str object;
# encode works on unicode objects so Python tries to decode it using 
# 'ascii' and fails
# problem 2: even if it worked, the result will be ignored; it doesn't 
# update html in situ, it returns a function result.
# problem 3: "ignore" with UTF-n: any valid unicode object 
# should be encodable in UTF-n; error implies end of the world,
# don't try to ignore it. Don't just whack in "ignore" willy-nilly,
# put it in only with a comment explaining your very cogent reasons for doing so.
# "ignore" with most other encodings: error implies that you are mistaken
# in your choice of encoding -- same advice as for UTF-n :-)
# "ignore" with decode latin1 aka iso-8859-1: error implies end of the world.
# Irrespective of error or not, you are probably mistaken
# (needing e.g. cp1252 or even cp850 instead) ;-)

<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>I use this helper function throughout all of my projects. If it ca n't convert the unicode , it ignores it. This ties into a <span style="background-color:yellow;">django</span> library , but with a little research you could bypass it . </p>
<pre><code>from django.utils import encoding

def convert_unicode_to_string(x):
    """
    >>> convert_unicode_to_string(u'ni\xf1era')
    'niera'
    """
    return encoding.smart_str(x, encoding='ascii', errors='ignore')
</code></pre>
<p>I no longer get any unicode errors after using this . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>If you have a string line , you can use the .encode ( [ encoding ] , [ errors = 'strict ' ] ) method for strings to convert encoding types . </p>
<p>line = 'my big string' </p>
<p>line.encode ( 'ascii ' , 'ignore ' ) </p>

<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>As an extension to Ignacio Vazquez-Abrams ' answer </p>
<pre><code>>>> u'aあä'.encode('ascii', 'ignore')
'a'
</code></pre>
<p>It is sometimes desirable to remove accents from characters and print the base form. This can be accomplished with </p>
<pre><code>>>> import unicodedata
>>> unicodedata.normalize('NFKD', u'aあä').encode('ascii', 'ignore')
'aa'
</code></pre>
<p>You may also want to translate other characters ( such as punctuation ) to their nearest equivalents , for instance the RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK unicode character does not get converted to an ascii APOSTROPHE when encoding . </p>
<pre><code>>>> print u'\u2019'
’
>>> unicodedata.name(u'\u2019')
'RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK'
>>> u'\u2019'.encode('ascii', 'ignore')
''
# Note we get an empty string back
>>> u'\u2019'.replace(u'\u2019', u'\'').encode('ascii', 'ignore')
"'"

<p>Although there are more efficient ways to accomplish this. See this question for more details Where is Python& # 39 ; s &quot ; best ASCII for this Unicode&quot ; database ? </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>For broken consoles like cmd.exe and HTML output you can always use : </p>
<pre><code>my_unicode_string.encode('ascii','xmlcharrefreplace')
</code></pre>
<p>This will preserve all the non-ascii chars while making them printable in pure ASCII and in HTML . </p>
