<h3>Question ( ID-2016006 ) : </h3><h2>Search a file for strings from a second file </h2><p>I have two files. The first file contains a list of 6 character keys ( SA0001 , SA1001 , etc. ) . The second file contains a list of dates and amounts where the first six positions will match the key in the first file. I want to verify that every key in the first file has at least one match in the second file. There may be more than one match which is okay and there may be records in the second file with no key in the first file which is also okay. So basically a loop within a loop. The problem arises when I want to break out of the inner loop after the first match because the second file could be quite large. It prints out the " found " message correctly and breaks , but it wo n't print the " not found " message if it reaches the end of the second file with out finding a match. My code so far is : </p>
<pre><code>unvalues = open("file1.txt", "r")
newfunds = open("file2.txt", "r").readlines()
i = 1
for line in newfunds:
    line = line.strip()
    for line2 in iter(unvalues.readline, ""):
        try:
            if line == line2[:6]:
                print "%s: Matching %s to %s for date %s" % (i, line, line2[:6], line2[6:14])
                break
        except StopIteration: print "%s: No match for %s" % (i, line)
    i += 1
    unvalues.seek(0)

<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>I do n't think break ; throws a StopIteration . </p>
<p>You generally do n't want to use exceptions for flow control like that . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>Go through each file once , adding each record to a <span style="background-color:yellow;">hash</span> with value equal to 1. Then make sure that the keys of the first <span style="background-color:yellow;">hash</span> are a subset of the keys of the second . </p>
<pre><code>hashes = []
for f in ["file1.txt","file2.txt"]:
    lines = open(f,"r").readlines()
    hash = {}
    for line in lines:
        hash[line[:6] = 1
    hashes.append(hash)

set_keys1 = set(hashes[0].keys())
set_keys2 = set(hashes[1].keys())
assert(set_keys1.issubset(set_keys2))

<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>I think this might be closer to what you want : </p>
<pre><code>unvalues = dict((line[:6], line[6:14]) for line in open("file1.txt", "r"))
newfunds = [line for line in open("file2.txt", "r")]
for i, line in enumerate(newfunds):
    key = line.strip()
    if key in unvalues:
        v = unvalues[key]
        print "%s: Matching %s to %s for date %s" % (i+1, line, key, v)
    else:
        print "%s: No match for %s" % (i+1, line)
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>You can not ( and need not ) catch the StopIteration exception that occurs when the iterator is finished , because it gets caught by the for loop automatically. To do what you appear to be trying to do , you could use an else block after your for block , e.g. you could replace your inner loop with this : </p>
<pre><code>for line2 in iter(unvalues.readline, ""):
    if line == line2[:6]:
        print "%s: Matching %s to %s for date %s" % (i, line, line2[:6], line2[6:14])
        break
else:
    print "%s: No match for %s" % (i, line)
</code></pre>
<p>The else block is executed when the for loop finishes without the break statement getting hit . </p>
<p>However , you may well find that one of the other approaches using sets is quicker . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><pre><code>from collections import defaultdict

unvalues = open("file1.txt", "r").readlines()
newfunds = open("file2.txt", "r").readlines()

unvals = defaultdict(int)

for val in unvalues:
    unvals[val] = 0

for line in newfunds:
    line = line.strip()

    if line[:6] in unvals.keys():
        unvals[line[:6]] += 1

for k in unvals.keys():
    if unvals[k] == 0:
        print "Match Not Found For %s" % k
</code></pre>
<p>might give you a good starting point for what you want to achieve , without being terribly messy. This gives you the performance advantage of only looping through each data set individually . </p>
<p>As a quick addendum , if you want line numbers , rather than building a counting variable outside the loop and incrementing it , try this instead : </p>
<pre><code>for i, line in enumerate(newfunds):
</code></pre>
<p>enumerate ( ) basically zips a sequential <span style="background-color:yellow;">integer</span> iterator with your list to produce the desired result without unnecessary counting operations . </p>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>Another approach using sets </p>
<pre><code>keys = set(line[:6] for line in open('file.txt'))
missing = set(value[:6] for value in open('file2.txt') if value[:6] not in keys)
if missing:
   print "Keys Missing " + ', '.join(missing)
</code></pre>
