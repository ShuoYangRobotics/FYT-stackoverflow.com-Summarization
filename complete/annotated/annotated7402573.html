<h3>Question ( ID-7402573 ) : </h3><h2>use type ( ) information to cast <span style="background-color:yellow;">values</span> stored as strings </h2><p>In my application I have generated a number of <span style="background-color:yellow;">values</span> ( three columns , of type int , str and <span style="background-color:yellow;">datetime</span> , see example below ) and these <span style="background-color:yellow;">values</span> are stored in a flat file as comma-separated strings. Furthermore , I store a file containing the type of the <span style="background-color:yellow;">values</span> ( see below ) . Now , how can I use this information to cast my <span style="background-color:yellow;">values</span> from the flat file to the correct data type in Python ? Is is possible or do I need to do some other stuff ? </p>
<p>Data file : </p>
<pre><code>#id,value,date
1,a,2011-09-13 15:00:00
2,b,2011-09-13 15:10:00
3,c,2011-09-13 15:20:00
4,d,2011-09-13 15:30:00
</code></pre>
<p>Type file : </p>
<pre><code>id,<type 'int'>
value,<type 'str'>
date,<type 'datetime.datetime'>
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-7 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>As I understand , you already parsed the file , you now just need to get the right type. So let 's say <span style="background-color:yellow;">id</span> , type and <span style="background-color:yellow;">value</span> are three strings that contain the <span style="background-color:yellow;">values</span> in the file. ( Note , type should contain 'int ' &mdash ; for example &mdash ; , not '&lt ; type 'int'&gt ; ' . </p>
<pre><code>try:
    # Check if it's a builtin type
    cls = getattr(__builtins__, type)
except AttributeError:
    module = sys.modules[__name__]
    cls = getattr(module, type)
</code></pre>
<p>Note that in that sample I assume the non-builtin is already imported in the current module. If not , you 'll have to parse the string and include the module yourself. Or not , depends exactly on what your program should do . </p>
<p>After you get the cls object , you do this : </p>
<pre><code>val = cls(value)
</code></pre>
<p>Obviously , cls must be initializable from a string . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>Follow these steps : </p>
<ol>Read the file line by line , for each line do the following steps Split the line using split ( ) with , as the separator . Cast the first element of list ( from step 2 ) as an int. Keep the second element as string. Parse the third <span style="background-color:yellow;">value</span> ( e.g. using slices ) and make a <span style="background-color:yellow;">datetime</span> object of the same . </ol>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>I had to deal with a similar situation in a recent program , that had to <span style="background-color:yellow;">convert</span> many fields. I used a list of tuples , where one element of the tuples was the conversion function to use. Sometimes it was int or float ; sometimes it was a simple lambda ; and sometimes it was the name of a function defined elsewhere . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>Instead of having a separate " type " file , take your list of tuples of ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">id</span> , <span style="background-color:yellow;">value</span> , <span style="background-color:yellow;">date</span> ) and just pickle it . </p>
<p>Or you 'll have to solve the problem of storing your string-to-type <span style="background-color:yellow;">converters</span> as <span style="background-color:yellow;">text</span> ( in your " type " file ) , which might be a fun problem to solve , but if you 're just trying to get something done , go with pickle or cPickle </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>First , you can not write a " universal " or " smart " conversion that magically handles anything . </p>
<p>Second , trying to summarize a string-to-data conversion in anything other than code never seems to work out well. So rather than write a string that names the conversion , just write the conversion . </p>
<p>Finally , trying to write a configuration file in a domain-specific language is silly. Just write Python code. It 's not much more complicated than trying to parse some configuration file . </p>
<blockquote>Is is possible or do i need to do some other stuff ? </blockquote>
<p>Do n't waste time trying to create a " type file " that 's not simply Python. It does n't help. It is simpler to write the conversion as a Python function. You can import that function as if it was your " type file " . </p>
<pre><code>import datetime

def convert( row ):
   return dict(
       id= int(row['id']),
       value= str(row['value']),
       date= datetime.datetime.strptime(row['date],"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"),
   )
</code></pre>
<p>That 's all you have in your " type file " </p>
<p>Now you can read ( and process ) your input like this . </p>
<pre><code> from type_file import convert
 import csv

 with open( "date", "rb" ) as source:
     rdr= csv.DictReader( source )
     for row in rdr:
         useful_row= convert( row )
</code></pre>
<hr />
<blockquote>in many cases i do not know the number of columns or the data type before runtime </blockquote>
<p>This means you are doomed . </p>
<p>You must have an actual definition the file content or you can not do any processing . </p>
<pre><code>"id","value","other value"
1,23507,3
</code></pre>
<p>You do n't know if " 23507 " should be an integer , a string , a postal code , or a floating-point ( which omitted the period ) , a duration ( in days or seconds ) or some other more complex thing. You ca n't hope and you ca n't guess . </p>
<p>After getting a definition , you need to write an explicit conversion function based on the actual definition . </p>
<p>After writing the conversion , you need to ( a ) test the conversion with a simple unit test , and ( b ) test the data to be sure it really <span style="background-color:yellow;">converts</span> . </p>
<p>Then you can process the file . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>Your types file can be simpler : </p>
<pre><code>id=int
value=str
date=datetime.datetime
</code></pre>
<p>Then in your main program you can </p>
<pre><code>import datetime

def convert_datetime(text):
    return datetime.datetime.strptime(text, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

data_types = {'int':int, 'str':str, 'datetime.datetime':convert_datetime}
fields = {}

for line in open('example_types.txt').readlines():
    key, val = line.strip().split('=')
    fields[key] = val

data_file = open('actual_data.txt')
field_info = data_file.readline().strip('#\n ').split(',')
values = [] #store it all here for now

for line in data_file.readlines():
    row = []
    for i, element in enumerate(line.strip().split(',')):
        element_type = fields[field_info[i]] # will get 'int', 'str', or 'datetime'
        convert = data_types[element_type]
        row.append(convert(element))
    values.append(row)

# to show it working...
for row in values:
    print row
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>You might want to look at the xlrd module. If you can load your data into excel , and it knows what type is associated with each column , xlrd will give you the type when you read the excel file. Of course , if the data is given to you as a <span style="background-color:yellow;">csv</span> then someone would have to go into the excel file and change the column types by hand . </p>
<p>Not sure this gets you all the way to where you want to go , but it might help </p>
