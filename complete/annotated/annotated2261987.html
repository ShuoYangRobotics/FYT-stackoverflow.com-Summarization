<h3>Question ( ID-2261987 ) : </h3><h2>Most Pythonic way of creating an infinite loop with a 'while ' statement </h2><p>Which one is the pythonic way of below two expressions . </p>
<pre><code>1. while 1:
2. while True:

<p>edit : Is there a pythonic way out of two above expressions ? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-11 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>Fundamentally it does <span style="background-color:yellow;">n't</span> matter , such minutiae does <span style="background-color:yellow;">n't</span> really affect whether something is 'pythonic ' or <span style="background-color:yellow;">not</span> . </p>
<p>If you 're interested in trivia however , there are some differences . </p>
<ol>The builtin boolean type did <span style="background-color:yellow;">n't</span> exist till Python 2.3 so code that was intended to run on ancient versions tends to use the while 1 : form. You 'll see it in the standard library , for instance . The True and False builtins are <span style="background-color:yellow;">not</span> reserved words prior to Python 3 so could be assigned to , changing their value. This helps with the case above because code could do True = 1 for backwards compatibility , but means that the <span style="background-color:yellow;">name</span> True <span style="background-color:yellow;">needs</span> to be looked up in the globals dictionary every time it is used . Because of the above restriction , the bytecode the two versions compile to is different in Python 2 as there 's an optimisation for constant integers that it ca <span style="background-color:yellow;">n't</span> use for True . Because Python can tell when compiling the 1 that it 's always <span style="background-color:yellow;">non-zero</span> , it removes the conditional jump and does <span style="background-color:yellow;">n't</span> load the constant at all : &gt ; &gt ; &gt ; import dis &gt ; &gt ; &gt ; def while_1 ( ) : ... while 1 : ... pass .. . &gt ; &gt ; &gt ; def while_true ( ) : ... while True : ... pass .. . &gt ; &gt ; &gt ; dis.dis ( while_1 ) 2 0 SETUP_LOOP 5 ( to 8 ) 3 &gt ; &gt ; 3 JUMP_ABSOLUTE 3 6 POP_TOP 7 POP_BLOCK &gt ; &gt ; 8 LOAD_CONST 0 ( None ) 11 RETURN_VALUE &gt ; &gt ; &gt ; dis.dis ( while_true ) 2 0 SETUP_LOOP 12 ( to 15 ) &gt ; &gt ; 3 LOAD_GLOBAL 0 ( True ) 6 JUMP_IF_FALSE 4 ( to 13 ) 9 POP_TOP 3 10 JUMP_ABSOLUTE 3 &gt ; &gt ; 13 POP_TOP 14 POP_BLOCK &gt ; &gt ; 15 LOAD_CONST 0 ( None ) 18 RETURN_VALUE </ol>
<p>So , while True : is a little easier to read , and while 1 : is a bit kinder to old versions of Python. As you 're unlikely to <span style="background-color:yellow;">need</span> to run on Python 2.2 these days or <span style="background-color:yellow;">need</span> to worry about the bytecode count of your loops , the former is marginally preferable . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>The most pythonic way will always be the most readable. Use while True : </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>Neither . </p>
<p>Both of them mean I have to scan the code looking for the break , instead of being able to see the stop condition right where it belongs . </p>
<p>I try to avoid this kind of thing wherever possible , and if it 's <span style="background-color:yellow;">not</span> possible , let the code speak for itself like this : </p>
<pre><code>while not found_answer:
    check_number += 1
    if check_number == 42:
        found_answer = True
</code></pre>
<p>Edit : It seems that the word " avoid " above was <span style="background-color:yellow;">n't</span> clear enough. Using a basically infinite loop and leaving it from somewhere within the loop ( using break ) should usually be avoided altogether . Sometimes that is <span style="background-color:yellow;">n't</span> possible. In that case , I like to use something like the code above , which , however , still represents the same concept &ndash ; the above code is <span style="background-color:yellow;">nothing</span> more than a compromise &ndash ; but at least , I can show the purpose of the loop at the beginning &ndash ; just like I would <span style="background-color:yellow;">n't</span> call a function do_something_with_args ( * args ) . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>It does <span style="background-color:yellow;">n't</span> really matter. Neither is hard to read or understand , though personally I 'd always use while True , which is a bit more explicit . </p>
<p></p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>I think this is mostly a matter of style. Both should be easily understandable as an infinite loop . </p>
<p>However , personally I prefer the second option. That 's because it just takes a mental micro-step less to understand , especially for programmers without C background . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>The first one will work also in those early versions where True is <span style="background-color:yellow;">not</span> yet defined . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>IMO the second option is more obvious . </p>
<p>If you could get rid of the while and write more compact code , that might be more pythonic . For example : </p>
<pre><code># Get the even numbers in the range 1..10
# Version 1
l = []
n = 1
while 1:
    if n % 2 == 0: l.append(n)
    n += 1
    if n > 10: break
print l

# Version 2
print [i for i in range(1, 11) if i % 2 == 0]

# Version 3
print range(2, 11, 2)
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>If you have an algorithm that is suppose to terminate in a finite time , I would recommend this , which is always safer than while True : </p>
<pre><code>maxiter = 1000
for i in xrange(maxiter):
   # your code
   # on success:
     break
else:
   # that algorithm has not finished in maxiter steps! do something accordingly
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 8 </b><br /><p>I believe the second expression is more explicit , and thus more pythonic . </p>
<br /><b># 9 </b><br /><p>This is only a matter of style , any programming beginner will understand either option . </p>
<p>But the second option will only work if True was <span style="background-color:yellow;">n't</span> assigned to False , which was possible until Python 3 : </p>
<pre><code>>>> True = False
>>> True
False
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 10 </b><br /><p>The better way is " while True " with a conditional break out of the loop . </p>
