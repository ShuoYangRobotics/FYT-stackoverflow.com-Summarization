<h3>Question ( ID-342434 ) : </h3><h2>Python <span style="background-color:yellow;">logging</span> in Django </h2><p>I 'm developing a Django app , and I 'm trying to use Python 's <span style="background-color:yellow;">logging</span> module for error/trace <span style="background-color:yellow;">logging.</span> Ideally I 'd like to have different loggers <span style="background-color:yellow;">configured</span> for different areas of the site. So far I 've got all of this working , but one thing has me scratching my head . </p>
<p>I have the root logger going to sys.stderr , and I have <span style="background-color:yellow;">configured</span> another logger to write to a file. This is in my settings.py file : </p>
<pre><code>sviewlog = logging.getLogger('MyApp.views.scans')
view_log_handler = logging.FileHandler('C:\\MyApp\\logs\\scan_log.log')
view_log_handler.setLevel(logging.INFO)
view_log_handler.setFormatter(logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s %(name)-12s %(levelname)-8s %(message)s'))
sviewlog.addHandler(view_log_handler)
</code></pre>
<p>Seems pretty simple. Here 's the problem , though : whatever I write to the <span style="background-color:yellow;">sviewlog</span> gets written to the log file twice. The root logger only prints it once. It 's like <span style="background-color:yellow;">addHandler</span> ( ) is being called twice. And when I put my code through a debugger , this is exactly what I see. The code in settings.py is getting executed twice , so two FileHandlers are created and added to the same logger instance. But why ? And how do I get around this ? </p>
<p>Can anyone tell me what 's going on here ? I 've tried moving the <span style="background-color:yellow;">sviewlog</span> logger/handler instantiation code to the file where it 's used ( since that actually seems like the appropriate place to me ) , but I have the same problem there. Most of the examples I 've seen online use only the root logger , and I 'd prefer to have multiple loggers . </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-11 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>Allow me to answer my own question. The underlying problem here is that settings.py gets imported twice , or maybe even more ( See here ) . ( I still do n't understand why this is. Maybe some Django expert could explain that to me. ) This seems to be true of some other modules as well. At this point I do n't think it 's wise to make assumptions about how many times settings.py will be imported. For that matter , such assumptions are n't safe in general. I 've had this code in places other than settings.py , and the results are similar . </p>
<p>You have to code around this. That is , you have to check your logger for existing <span style="background-color:yellow;">handlers</span> before adding additional <span style="background-color:yellow;">handlers</span> to it. This is a bit ugly because it 's perfectly reasonable to have multiple <span style="background-color:yellow;">handlers</span> -- even of the same type -- attached to one logger. There are a few solutions to dealing with this. One is check the <span style="background-color:yellow;">handlers</span> property of your logger object. If you only want one handler and your length &gt ; 0 , then do n't add it. Personally I do n't love this solution , because it gets messy with more <span style="background-color:yellow;">handlers</span> . </p>
<p>I prefer something like this ( thanks to Thomas Guettler ) : </p>
<pre><code># file logconfig.py
if not hasattr(logging, "set_up_done"):
    logging.set_up_done=False

def set_up(myhome):
    if logging.set_up_done:
        return
    # set up your logging here
    # ...
    logging.set_up_done=True
</code></pre>
<p>I must say , I wish the fact that Django imports settings.py multiple times were better documented. And I would imagine that my <span style="background-color:yellow;">configuration</span> is somehow cause this multiple import , but I 'm having trouble finding out what is causing the problem and why. Maybe I just could n't find that in their documents , but I would think that 's the sort of thing you need to warn your users about . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>As of version 1.3 , Django uses standard python <span style="background-color:yellow;">logging</span> , <span style="background-color:yellow;">configured</span> with the LOGGING setting ( documented here : 1.3 , dev ) . </p>
<p>Django <span style="background-color:yellow;">logging</span> reference : 1.3 , dev . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>Difficult to comment on your specific case. If settings.py is executed twice , then it 's normal that you get two lines for every log sent . </p>
<p>The way we set it up in our projects is to have one module dedicated to <span style="background-color:yellow;">logging.</span> That modules has a " module singleton " pattern , so that we only execute the interesting code once . </p>
<p>It looks like this : </p>
<pre><code>def init_logging():
    stdoutHandler = logging.StreamHandler( sys.stdout )
    stdoutHandler.setLevel( DEBUG )
    stdoutHandler.setFormatter( logging.Formatter( LOG_FORMAT_WITH_TIME ) )
    logging.getLogger( LOG_AREA1 ).addHandler( stdoutHandler )

logInitDone=False
if not logInitDone:
    logInitDone = True
   init_logging()
</code></pre>
<p>Importing the log.py the first time will <span style="background-color:yellow;">configure</span> the <span style="background-color:yellow;">logging</span> correctly . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>` ` To answer the question about why does " Django imports settings.py multiple times " : it does not.'' </p>
<p>Actually , it does get imported twice ( skip past the first code chunk to get right into it but a good read if you 've got the time ) : </p>
<p><span style="background-color:yellow;">http</span> : //blog.dscpl.com.au/2010/03/improved-wsgi-script-for-use-with.html </p>
<p>PS-- Sorry to revive an old thread . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>You could get around your problem by checking for the number of <span style="background-color:yellow;">handlers</span> when you are doing your init . </p>
<pre><code>def init_logging():
    stdoutHandler = logging.StreamHandler( sys.stdout )
    stdoutHandler.setLevel( DEBUG )
    stdoutHandler.setFormatter( logging.Formatter( LOG_FORMAT_WITH_TIME ) )
    logger = logging.getLogger( LOG_AREA1 )
    if len(logger.handlers) < 1:
        logger.addHandler( stdoutHandler )
</code></pre>
<p>I do n't think this is a great way to handle it. Personally , for <span style="background-color:yellow;">logging</span> in <span style="background-color:yellow;">django</span> with the python <span style="background-color:yellow;">logging</span> module , I create a logger in views.py for each application I 'm interested in , then grab the logger in each view function . </p>
<pre><code>from django.http import HttpResponse
from magic import makeLogger
from magic import getLogger

makeLogger('myLogName', '/path/to/myLogName.log')
def testLogger(request):
    logger = getLogger('myLogName')
    logger.debug('this worked')
    return HttpResponse('TEXT, HTML or WHATEVER')
</code></pre>
<p>This is a pretty good article about debugging <span style="background-color:yellow;">django</span> and covers some <span style="background-color:yellow;">logging</span> : <span style="background-color:yellow;">http</span> : //simonwillison.net/2008/May/22/debugging/ </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>To answer the question about why does " Django imports settings.py multiple times " : it does not . </p>
<p>You are probably running a multiprocess/multithread web server which creates several python sub-interpreters , where each of those imports the code from your <span style="background-color:yellow;">django</span> app once . </p>
<p>Test that on the <span style="background-color:yellow;">django</span> test server and you should see that settings are not imported many times . </p>
<p>Some time ago , I had designed a nice singleton ( python borg idiom version to be more precise ) with my first <span style="background-color:yellow;">django/apache</span> app , before I quickly realised that yes , I had more than one instances of my singleton created.. . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>You can also use a run-once Middleware to get a similar effect , without the private variables. Note that this will only <span style="background-color:yellow;">configure</span> the <span style="background-color:yellow;">logging</span> for web-requests - you 'll need to find a different solution if you want <span style="background-color:yellow;">logging</span> in your shell or command runs . </p>
<pre><code>from django.conf import settings
from django.core.exceptions import MiddlewareNotUsed
import logging
import logging.handlers
import logging.config

__all__ = ('LoggingConfigMiddleware',)


class LoggingConfigMiddleware:
    def __init__(self):
        '''Initialise the logging setup from settings, called on first request.'''
        if hasattr(settings, 'LOGGING'):
            logging.config.dictConfig(settings.LOGGING)
        elif getattr(settings, 'DEBUG', False):
            print 'No logging configured.'
        raise MiddlewareNotUsed('Logging setup only.')
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>Why using python logger instead of <span style="background-color:yellow;">django-logging</span> ? Give it a try it might just solve your problem . </p>
<p><span style="background-color:yellow;">http</span> : //code.google.com/p/django-logging/wiki/Overview </p>
<p>At the moment it would only allow to view the root logger , but you can sure write to multiple loggers . </p>
<br /><b># 8 </b><br /><p>Reviving an old thread , but I was experiencing duplicate messages while using Django 1.3 Python <span style="background-color:yellow;">logging</span> with the dictConfig format . </p>
<p>The disable_existing_loggers gets rid of the duplicate handler/logging problem with multiple settings.py loads , but you can still get duplicate log messages if you do n't specify the propagate boolean appropriately on the specific logger . Namely , make sure you set propagate = False for child loggers. E.g., </p>
<pre><code>'loggers': {
    'django': {
        'handlers':['null'],
        'propagate': True,
        'level':'INFO',
    },
    'django.request': {
        'handlers': ['console'],
        'level': 'ERROR',
        'propagate': False,
    },
    'project': {
        'handlers': ['console', 'project-log-file'],
        'level': 'DEBUG',
        'propagate': True,
    },
    'project.customapp': {
        'handlers': ['console', 'customapp-log-file'],
        'level': 'DEBUG',
        'propagate': False,
    },
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here , project.customapp sets propagate = False so that it wo n't be caught by the project logger as well. The Django <span style="background-color:yellow;">logging</span> docs are excellent , as always . </p>
<br /><b># 9 </b><br /><p>A hackish way , but you can try to put the <span style="background-color:yellow;">logging</span> code inside an admin.py. It is supposed to be imported only once . </p>
<p>Alternatively ; can you first check if MyApp.views.scans log exists ? If it exists ( maybe an error is raised ) you can simply skip creation ( and therefore not add the handler again ) . A cleaner way but I have n't tried this though . </p>
<p>Also there must be a more appropriate place to put this code ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">__init__.py</span> ? ) . settings.py is for settings . </p>
<br /><b># 10 </b><br /><p>To add to A Lee post , python <span style="background-color:yellow;">logging</span> documentation states this about propagate : </p>
<blockquote>Logger.propagate If this evaluates to false , <span style="background-color:yellow;">logging</span> messages are not passed by this logger or by its child loggers to the <span style="background-color:yellow;">handlers</span> of higher level ( ancestor ) loggers. The constructor sets this attribute to 1 . </blockquote>
<p>This means that if propagate = = False then child logger will NOT pass <span style="background-color:yellow;">logging</span> message to its parent logger </p>
