<h3>Question ( ID-1859959 ) : </h3><h2>Python static methods - how to call a method from another method </h2><p>When I have regular methods for calling another method in a class I have to do this </p>
<pre><code>class test:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    def dosomething(self):
        print "do something"
        self.dosomethingelse()
    def dosomethingelse(self):
        print "do something else"
</code></pre>
<p>but when I have static methods I ca n't write </p>
<pre><code>self.dosomethingelse()
</code></pre>
<p>because there is no instance. How do I have to do in Python for calling an static method from another static method of the same class ? </p>
<p>Edit : what a mess. Ok , I edited back the question to the original question. I already have the answer to the second question that 's in Peter Hansen 's comment. If you think I should open another question for an answer I already have , plz tell me . </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-6 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>class.method should work . </p>
<pre><code>class SomeClass:
  @classmethod
  class some_class_method(cls):
    pass

  @staticmethod
  class some_static_method():
    pass

SomeClass.some_class_method()
SomeClass.some_static_method()
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>you cant call non-static methods from static methods but by creating an instance inside the static method... . it should work like that </p>
<p>class <span style="background-color:yellow;">test2</span> ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> ) : def init ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">self</span> ) : pass </p>
<pre><code>@staticmethod
def dosomething():
    print "do something"
    #creating an instance to be able to call dosomethingelse(),or you may use any existing instace
    a=test2()
    a.dosomethingelse()

def dosomethingelse(self):
    print "do something else"
</code></pre>
<p><span style="background-color:yellow;">test2.dosomething</span> ( ) </p>
<p>hope that will help you : ) </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>NOTE - it looks like the question has changed some. The answer to the question of how you call an instance method from a static method is that you ca n't without passing an instance in as an argument or instantiating that instance inside the static method . </p>
<p>What follows is mostly to answer " how do you call a static method from another static method " : </p>
<p>Bear in mind that there is a difference between static methods and class methods in Python. A static method takes no implicit first argument , while a class method takes the class as the implicit first argument ( usually <span style="background-color:yellow;">cls</span> by convention ) . With that in mind , here 's how you would do that : </p>
<p>If it 's a static method : </p>
<pre><code>test.dosomethingelse()
</code></pre>
<p>If it 's a class method : </p>
<pre><code>cls.dosomethingelse()
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>ok the main deffirence between class methods and static methods is : class method has its own identity , thats why they have to be called from within an INSTANCE . on the other hand static method can be shared between multiple instances so that it must be called from within THE CLASS </p>

<pre><code>class Test() :
    @staticmethod
    def static_method_to_call()
        pass

    @staticmethod
    def another_static_method() :
        Test.static_method_to_call()

    @classmethod
    def another_class_method(cls) :
        cls.static_method_to_call()
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>ok , this is what I have </p>
<pre><code>class test2(object):
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    @staticmethod
    def dosomething():
        print "do something"
        test2.dosomethingelse()

    def dosomethingelse(self):
        print "do something else"

a = test2
a.dosomething()
</code></pre>
<p>if I call <span style="background-color:yellow;">dosomethingelse</span> from <span style="background-color:yellow;">dosomething</span> as <span style="background-color:yellow;">test2.dosomethingelse</span> ( ) I get " unbound method <span style="background-color:yellow;">dosomethingelse</span> ( ) must be called with <span style="background-color:yellow;">test2</span> instance as first argument ( got nothing instead ) " </p>
<p>if I call <span style="background-color:yellow;">dosomethingelse</span> from <span style="background-color:yellow;">dosomething</span> as <span style="background-color:yellow;">self.dosomethingelse</span> ( ) I get global name 'self ' is not defined . </p>
<p>BTW , arent in Python Static methods what in other languages are called Class methods ? </p>
