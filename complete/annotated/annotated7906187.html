<h3>Question ( ID-7906187 ) : </h3><h2>Enforcing method order in a python module </h2><p>What is the most pythonic way to deal with a module in which methods must be called in a certain order ? </p>
<p>As an example , I have an XML configuration that must be read before doing anything else because the configuration affects behavior. The <span style="background-color:yellow;">parse_config</span> ( ) must be called first with the config file provided. Calling other supporting methods like <span style="background-color:yellow;">query_data</span> ( ) wo n't work until <span style="background-color:yellow;">parse_config</span> ( ) has been called . </p>
<p>I first implemented this as a singleton to ensure that a filename for the config is passed at time of initialization , but noticing that modules are actually singletons , it 's no longer a class , but just a regular module . </p>
<p>What 's the best way to enforce the <span style="background-color:yellow;">parse_config</span> being called first in a module ? </p>
<p>Edit : Worth noting is that the function is actually <span style="background-color:yellow;">parse_config</span> ( configfile ) </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-6 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>If the <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> is n't valid before it 's called , then call that method in <span style="background-color:yellow;">__init__</span> ( or use a factory function ) . You do n't need any silly singletons , that 's for sure . </p>
<br /><b># <span style="background-color:yellow;">1</span> </b><br /><p>The model I have been using is that subsequent functions are only available as methods on the return value of previous functions , like this : </p>
<pre><code>class Second(object):
   def two(self):
     print "two"
     return Third()

class Third(object):
   def three(self):
     print "three"

def one():
   print "one"
   return Second()

one().two().three()
</code></pre>
<p>Properly designed , this style ( which I admit is not terribly Pythonic , yet ) makes for fluent libraries to handle complex pipeline operations where later steps in the library require both the results of early calculations and fresh input from the calling function . </p>
<p>An interesting result is error handling. What I 've found is the best way of handling well-understood errors in pipeline steps is having a blank <span style="background-color:yellow;">Error</span> class that supposedly can handle every function in the pipeline ( except initial <span style="background-color:yellow;">one</span> ) but those functions ( except possibly terminal <span style="background-color:yellow;">ones</span> ) return only <span style="background-color:yellow;">self</span> : </p>
<pre><code>class Error(object):
   def two(self, *args):
      print "two not done because of earlier errors"
      return self
   def three(self, *args):
      print "three not done because of earlier errors"

class Second(object):
   def two(self, arg):
     if arg == 2:
       print "two"
       return Third()
     else:
       print "two cannot be done"
       return Error()

class Third(object):
   def three(self):
     print "three"

def one(arg):
   if arg == 1:
      print "one"
      return Second()
   else:
      print "one cannot be done"
      return Error()

one(1).two(-1).three()

<p>In your example , you 'd have the Parser class , which would have almost nothing but a configure function that returned an instance of a ConfiguredParser class , which would do all the thing that only a properly configured parser could do. This gives you access to such things as multiple configurations and handling failed attempts at configuration . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>As Cat Plus Plus said in other words , wrap the behaviour/functions up in a class and put all the required setup in the <span style="background-color:yellow;">__init__</span> method. You might complain that the functions do n't seem like they naturally belong together in an <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> and , hence , this is bad OO design. If that 's the case , think of your class/object as a form of name-spacing. It 's much cleaner and more flexible than trying to enforce function calling order somehow or using singletons . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>What it comes down to is how friendly do you want your error messages to be if a function is called before it is configured . </p>
<p>Least friendly is to do nothing extra , and let the functions fail noisily with AttributeError s , IndexError s , etc . </p>
<p>Most friendly would be having stub functions that raise an informative exception , such as a custom <span style="background-color:yellow;">ConfigError</span> : configuration not initialized . When the ConfigParser ( ) function is called it can then replace the stub functions with real functions. Something like this : </p>
<pre><code>config.py
----------
class ConfigError(Exception):
    "configuration errors"

def query_data():
    raise ConfigError("parse_config() has not been called")

def _query_data():
    do_actual_work()

def parse_config(config_file):
    load_file(config_file)
    if failure:
        raise ConfigError("bad file")
    all_objects = globals()
    for name in ('query_data', ):
        working_func = all_objects['_'+name]
        all_objects[name] = working_func
</code></pre>
<p>If you have very many functions you can add decorators to keep track of the function names , but that 's an answer for a different question. ; ) </p>
<p>Okay , I could n't resist -- here is the decorator version , which makes my solution much easier to actually implement : </p>
<pre><code>class ConfigError(Exception):
    "various configuration errors"

class NeedsConfig(object):
    def __init__(self, module_namespace):
        self._namespace = module_namespace
        self._functions = dict()
    def __call__(self, func):
        self._functions[func.__name__] = func
        return self._stub
    @staticmethod
    def _stub(*args, **kwargs):
        raise ConfigError("parseconfig() needs to be called first")
    def go_live(self):
        for name, func in self._functions.items():
            self._namespace[name] = func
</code></pre>
<p>And a sample run : </p>
<pre><code>needs_parseconfig = NeedsConfig(globals())

@needs_parseconfig
def query_data():
    print "got some data!"

@needs_parseconfig
def set_data():
    print "set the data!"

def okay():
    print "Okay!"

def parse_config(somefile):
    needs_parseconfig.go_live()

try:
    query_data()
except ConfigError, e:
    print e

try:
    set_data()
except ConfigError, e:
    print e

try:
    okay()
except:
    print "this shouldn't happen!"
    raise

parse_config('config_file')
query_data()
set_data()
okay()
</code></pre>
<p>and the results : </p>
<pre><code>parseconfig() needs to be called first
parseconfig() needs to be called first
Okay!
got some data!
set the data!
Okay!
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see , the decorator works by remembering the functions it decorates , and instead of returning a decorated function it returns a simple stub that raises a <span style="background-color:yellow;">ConfigError</span> if it is ever called. When the <span style="background-color:yellow;">parse_config</span> ( ) routine is called , it needs to call the <span style="background-color:yellow;">go_live</span> ( ) method which will then replace all the error raising stubs with the actual remembered functions . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>The simple requirement that a module needs to be " configured " before it is used is best handled by a class which does the " configuration " in the <span style="background-color:yellow;">__init__</span> method , as in the currently-accepted answer. Other module functions become methods of the class. There is no benefit in trying to make a singleton ... the caller may well want to have <span style="background-color:yellow;">two</span> or more differently-configured gadgets operating simultaneously . </p>
<p>Moving on from that to a more complicated requirement , such as a temporal ordering of the methods : </p>
<p>This can be handled in a quite general fashion by maintaining state in attributes of the <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> , as is usually done in any OOPable language. Each method that has prerequisites must check that those prequisites are satisfied . </p>
<p>Poking in replacement methods is an obfuscation on a par with the COBOL ALTER verb , and made worse by using decorators -- it just would n't/should n't get past code review . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>A module does n't do anything it is n't told to do so put your function calls at the bottom of the module so that when you import it , things get ran in the order you specify : </p>
<h2>test.py </h2>
<pre><code>import testmod
</code></pre>
<h2><span style="background-color:yellow;">testmod.py</span> </h2>
<pre><code>def fun1():
    print('fun1')

def fun2():
    print('fun2')

fun1()
fun2()
</code></pre>
<p>When you run test.py , you 'll see <span style="background-color:yellow;">fun1</span> is ran before <span style="background-color:yellow;">fun2</span> : </p>
<pre><code>python test.py 
fun1
fun2
</code></pre>
