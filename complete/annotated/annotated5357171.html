<h3>Question ( ID-5357171 ) : </h3><h2>how to generate all possible combinations of a 14x10 matrix containing only 1 's and 0 's </h2><p>I 'm working on a problem and one solution would require an input of <span style="background-color:yellow;">every</span> 14x10 matrix that is possible to be made up of 1 's and 0 's... how can I generate these so that I can input <span style="background-color:yellow;">every</span> possible 14x10 matrix <span style="background-color:yellow;">into</span> another function ? Thank you ! </p>
<p>Added March 21 : It looks like I did n't word my post appropriately. Sorry. What I 'm trying to do is optimize the output of <span style="background-color:yellow;">10</span> different <span style="background-color:yellow;">production</span> units ( given different speeds and amounts of downtime ) for several scenarios. My goal is to place blocks of downtime to minimized the differences in <span style="background-color:yellow;">production</span> on a day-to-day basis. The amount of downtime and frequency <span style="background-color:yellow;">each</span> unit is allowed is given. I am currently trying to <span style="background-color:yellow;">evaluate</span> a three week cycle , meaning <span style="background-color:yellow;">every</span> three weeks <span style="background-color:yellow;">each</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">production</span> unit is taken down for a given amount of hours. I was asking the computer to determine the order the units would be taken down based on the constraint that the lines come down only once <span style="background-color:yellow;">every</span> 3 weeks and the difference in daily <span style="background-color:yellow;">production</span> is the smallest possible. My first approach was to use Excel ( as I tried to describe above ) and it did n't work ( no suprise there ) ... where 1- running , 0- off and when these are summed to calculate <span style="background-color:yellow;">production.</span> The calculated <span style="background-color:yellow;">production</span> is subtracted from a set max daily <span style="background-color:yellow;">production.</span> Then , these differences were compared going from Mon-Tues , Tues-Wed , <span style="background-color:yellow;">etc</span> for a three week time frame and minimized using solver. My next approach was to write a Matlab code where the input was a tolerance ( set allowed variation day-to-day ) . Is there a program that already does this or an approach to do this <span style="background-color:yellow;">easiest</span> ? It seems simple <span style="background-color:yellow;">enough</span> , but I 'm still thinking through the different ways to go about this. Any insight would be much appreciated . </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-10 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>Generating Every possible matrix of 1 's and 0 's for 14 * <span style="background-color:yellow;">10</span> would generate 2 * * 140 matrixes. I do n't believe you would have <span style="background-color:yellow;">enough</span> lifetime for this. I do n't know , if the sun would still shine before you finish that. This is why it is impossible to generate all those matrices. You must look for some other solution , this looks like a brute force . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>The actual implementation depends heavily on how you want to represent matricesâ€Ś But assuming the matrix can be represented by a 14 * 10 = 140 element list:</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import product
for matrix in product([0, 1], repeat=140):
    # ... do stuff with the matrix ...
</code></pre>
<p></p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>Trying this : </p>
<pre><code>import numpy
for i in xrange(int(1e9)): a = numpy.random.random_integers(0,1,(14,10))
</code></pre>
<p>( which is much , much , much smaller than what you require ) should be <span style="background-color:yellow;">enough</span> to convince you that this is not feasible. It also shows you how to calculate one , or few , such random matrices <span style="background-color:yellow;">even</span> up to a million is pretty fast ) . </p>
<p>EDIT : changed to xrange to " improve speed and memory requirements " : ) </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>Are you sure you want <span style="background-color:yellow;">every</span> possible 14x10 matrix ? There are 140 <span style="background-color:yellow;">elements</span> in <span style="background-color:yellow;">each</span> matrix , and <span style="background-color:yellow;">each</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">element</span> can be on or off. Therefore there are 2 ^ 140 possible matrices. I suggest you reconsider what you really want . </p>
<p>Edit : I noticed you mentioned in a comment that you are trying to minimize something. There is an <span style="background-color:yellow;">entire</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">mathematical</span> field called optimization devoted to doing this type of thing. The reason this field <span style="background-color:yellow;">exists</span> is because quite often it is not possible to <span style="background-color:yellow;">exhaustively</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">examine</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">every</span> solution in anything resembling a reasonable amount of time . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>This is absolutely impossible ! The number of possible matrices is 2 140 , which is around 1.4e42. However , consider the following.. . </p>
<ul>If you were to generate two 14-by-10 matrices at random , the odds that they would be the same are 1 in 1.4e42 . If you were to generate 1 billion unique 14-by-10 matrices , then the odds that the next one you generate would be the same as one of those would still be <span style="background-color:yellow;">exceedingly</span> slim : 1 in 1.4e33 . The default random number stream in MATLAB uses a Mersenne twister algorithm that has a period of 2 19936 -1. Therefore , the random number generator should n't start <span style="background-color:yellow;">repeating</span> itself any time this <span style="background-color:yellow;">eon</span> . </ul>
<p>Your approach should be thus : </p>
<ul>Find a computer no one <span style="background-color:yellow;">ever</span> wants to use again . Give it as much storage space as possible to save your results . Install MATLAB on it and fire it up . Start computing matrices at random like so : while true newMatrix = randi ( [ 0 1 ] ,14,10 ) ; % # Process the matrix and output your results to disk <span style="background-color:yellow;">end</span> Walk away </ul>
<p>Since there are so many combinations , you do n't have to compare newMatrix with any of the previous matrices since the length of time before a <span style="background-color:yellow;">repeat</span> is likely to occur is astronomically large. Your processing is more likely to stop due to other reasons first , such as ( in order of likely occurrence ) : </p>
<ul>You run out of disk space to store your results . There 's a power outage . Your computer suffers a fatal hardware failure . You pass away . The Earth passes away . The Universe dies a slow heat death . </ul>
<hr />
<p>NOTE : Although I injected some humor <span style="background-color:yellow;">into</span> the above answer , I think I have illustrated one useful alternative. If you simply want to <span style="background-color:yellow;">sample</span> a small subset of the possible combinations ( where <span style="background-color:yellow;">even</span> 1 billion could be considered " small " due to the sheer number of combinations ) then you do n't have to go through the <span style="background-color:yellow;">extra</span> time- and memory-consuming steps of saving all of the matrices you 've already processed and comparing new ones to it to make sure you are n't <span style="background-color:yellow;">repeating</span> matrices. Since the odds of <span style="background-color:yellow;">repeating</span> a combination are so low , you could safely do this : </p>
<pre><code>for iLoop = 1:whateverBigNumberYouWant
  newMatrix = randi([0 1],14,10);  %# Generate a new matrix
  %# Process the matrix and save your results
end
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>You do n't have to iterate over this : </p>
<pre><code>def everyPossibleMatrix(x,y):
    N=x*y
    for i in range(2**N):
        b="{:0{}b}".format(i,N)
        yield '\n'.join(b[j*x:(j+1)*x] for j in range(y))
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>Depending on what you want to accomplish with the generated matrices , you might be better off generating a random <span style="background-color:yellow;">sample</span> and running a number of simulations. Something like : </p>
<pre><code>matrix_samples = []
# generate 10 matrices
for i in range(10):
    sample = numpy.random.binomial(1, .5, 14*10)
    sample.shape = (14, 10)
    matrix_samples.append(sample)
</code></pre>
<p>You could do this a number of times to see how results vary across simulations. Of course , you could also modify the code to <span style="background-color:yellow;">ensure</span> that there are no <span style="background-color:yellow;">repeats</span> in a <span style="background-color:yellow;">sample</span> set , again depending on what you 're trying to accomplish . </p>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>Are you saying that you have a table with 140 cells and <span style="background-color:yellow;">each</span> value can be 1 or 0 and you 'd like to generate <span style="background-color:yellow;">every</span> possible output ? If so , you would have 2 ^ 140 possible combinations...which is quite a large number . </p>
<br /><b># 8 </b><br /><p>Instead of just suggesting the this is unfeasible , I would suggest considering a scheme that <span style="background-color:yellow;">samples</span> the important subset of all possible combinations instead of applying a brute force approach. As one of your replies suggested , you are doing minimization. There are numerical techniques to do this such as simulated annealing , monte carlo sampling as well as traditional minimization algorithms. You might want to look <span style="background-color:yellow;">into</span> whether one is appropriate in your case . </p>
<br /><b># 9 </b><br /><p>I was actually much more pessimistic to begin with , but consider : </p>
<pre><code>from math import log, e

def timeInYears(totalOpsNeeded=2**140, currentOpsPerSecond=10**9, doublingPeriodInYears=1.5):
    secondsPerYear = 365.25 * 24 * 60 * 60
    doublingPeriodInSeconds = doublingPeriodInYears * secondsPerYear
    k = log(2,e) / doublingPeriodInSeconds  # time-proportionality constant
    timeInSeconds = log(1 + k*totalOpsNeeded/currentOpsPerSecond, e) / k
    return timeInSeconds / secondsPerYear
</code></pre>
<p>if we assume that computer processing power continues to double <span style="background-color:yellow;">every</span> 18 months , and you can currently do a billion combinations per second ( optimistic , but for sake of argument ) and you start today , your calculation will be complete on or about April 29th 2137 . </p>
