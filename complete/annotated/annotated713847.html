<h3>Question ( ID-713847 ) : </h3><h2>Recommendations of Python REST ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">web</span> services ) framework ? </h2><p>Is there a list somewhere of recommendations of different Python-based REST frameworks for use on the serverside to write your own RESTful APIs ? Preferably with pros and cons . </p>
<p>Please feel free to add recommendations here. : ) </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-15 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>Something I do n't like about CherryPy and Django is that , by default , they treat <span style="background-color:yellow;">GET</span> and POST as if they were the same thing. In a proper RESTful API HTTP-verbs are very important , and unless you 're very careful and do explicit checks at every request handler , you 'll end up falling into a REST anti-pattern . </p>
<p>One framework that gets it right is <span style="background-color:yellow;">web.py</span> . When combined with the <span style="background-color:yellow;">mimerender</span> library , it allows you to write nice RESTful <span style="background-color:yellow;">webservices</span> : </p>
<pre><code>import web
import json
from mimerender import mimerender

render_xml = lambda message: '<message>%s</message>'%message
render_json = lambda **args: json.dumps(args)
render_html = lambda message: '<html><body>%s</body></html>'%message
render_txt = lambda message: message

urls = (
    '/(.*)', 'greet'
)
app = web.application(urls, globals())

class greet:
    @mimerender(
        default = 'html',
        html = render_html,
        xml  = render_xml,
        json = render_json,
        txt  = render_txt
    )
    def GET(self, name):
        if not name: 
            name = 'world'
        return {'message': 'Hello, ' + name + '!'}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
</code></pre>
<p>The service 's logic is implemented only once , and the correct representation selection ( Accept header ) + dispatch to the proper render function ( or template ) is done in a tidy , transparent way . </p>
<pre><code>$ curl localhost:8080/x
<html><body>Hello, x!</body></html>

$ curl -H "Accept: application/html" localhost:8080/x
<html><body>Hello, x!</body></html>

$ curl -H "Accept: application/xml" localhost:8080/x
<message>Hello, x!</message>

$ curl -H "Accept: application/json" localhost:8080/x
{'message':'Hello, x!'}

$ curl -H "Accept: text/plain" localhost:8080/x
Hello, x!

<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>Surprised no one mentioned flask . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>We 're using Django for RESTful <span style="background-color:yellow;">web</span> services . </p>
<p>Note that -- out of the box -- Django did not have fine-grained enough authentication for our needs. We used the Django-REST interface , which helped a lot. [ We 've since rolled our own because we 'd made so many extensions that it had become a maintenance nightmare. ] </p>
<p>We have two kinds of URL 's : " html " URL 's which implement the human-oriented HTML pages , and " <span style="background-color:yellow;">json</span> " URL 's which implement the <span style="background-color:yellow;">web-services</span> oriented processing. Our view functions often look like this . </p>
<pre><code>def someUsefulThing( request, object_id ):
    # do some processing
    return { a dictionary with results }

def htmlView( request, object_id ):
    d = someUsefulThing( request, object_id )
    render_to_response( 'template.html', d, ... )

def jsonView( request, object_id ):
    d = someUsefulThing( request, object_id )
    data = serializers.serialize( 'json', d['object'], fields=EXPOSED_FIELDS )
    response = HttpResponse( data, status=200, content_type='application/json' )
    response['Location']= reverse( 'some.path.to.this.view', kwargs={...} )
    return response
</code></pre>
<p>The point being that the useful functionality is factored out of the two presentations. The JSON presentation is usually just one object that was requested. The HTML presentation often includes all kinds of navigation aids and other contextual clues that help people be productive . </p>
<p>The <span style="background-color:yellow;">jsonView</span> functions are all very similar , which can be a bit annoying. But it 's Python , so make them part of a callable class or write decorators if it helps . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>See Python Web Frameworks wiki . </p>
<p>You probably do not need the full stack frameworks , but the remaining list is still quite long . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>I really like CherryPy . Here 's an example of a restful <span style="background-color:yellow;">web</span> service : </p>
<pre><code>import cherrypy
from cherrypy import expose

class Converter:
    @expose
    def index(self):
        return "Hello World!"

    @expose
    def fahr_to_celc(self, degrees):
        temp = (float(degrees) - 32) * 5 / 9
        return "%.01f" % temp

    @expose
    def celc_to_fahr(self, degrees):
        temp = float(degrees) * 9 / 5 + 32
        return "%.01f" % temp

cherrypy.quickstart(Converter())
</code></pre>
<p>This emphasizes what I really like about CherryPy ; this is a completely working example that 's very understandable even to someone who does n't know the framework. If you run this code , then you can immediately see the results in your <span style="background-color:yellow;">web</span> browser ; e.g. visiting http : //localhost : 8080/celc_to_fahr ? <span style="background-color:yellow;">degrees</span> = 50 will display 122.0 in your <span style="background-color:yellow;">web</span> browser . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>Take a look at </p>
<ul>Itty ( blog post ) Bottle <span style="background-color:yellow;">web.py</span> juno </ul>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>Here is a discussion in CherryPy docs on REST : http : //docs.cherrypy.org/dev/progguide/REST.html </p>
<p>In particular it mentions a built in CherryPy dispatcher called MethodDispatcher , which invokes methods based on their HTTP-verb identifiers ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">GET</span> , POST , etc... ) . </p>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>Piston is very flexible framework for wirting RESTful APIs for Django applications . </p>
<br /><b># 8 </b><br /><p>I am not an expert on the python world but I have been using django which is an excellent <span style="background-color:yellow;">web</span> framework and can be used to create a restful framework . </p>
<br /><b># 9 </b><br /><p>In 2010 , the Pylons and repoze.bfg communities " joined forces " to create Pyramid , a <span style="background-color:yellow;">web</span> framework based most heavily on repoze.bfg. It retains the philosophies of its parent frameworks , and can be used for RESTful services . It 's worth a look . </p>
<br /><b># 10 </b><br /><p>I do n't see any reason to use Django just to <span style="background-color:yellow;">expose</span> a REST api , there are lighter and more flexible solutions. Django carries a lot of other things to the table , that are not always needed. For sure not needed if you only want to <span style="background-color:yellow;">expose</span> some code as a REST service . </p>
<p>My personal experience , fwiw , is that once you have a one-size-fits-all framework , you 'll start to use its ORM , its plugins , etc. just because it 's easy , and in no time you end up having a dependency that is very hard to get rid of . </p>
<p>Choosing a <span style="background-color:yellow;">web</span> framework is a tough decision , and I would avoid picking a full stack solution just to <span style="background-color:yellow;">expose</span> a REST api . </p>
<p>Now , if you really need/want to use Django , then Piston is a nice REST framework for django apps . </p>
<p>That being said , CherryPy looks really nice too , but seems more RPC than REST . </p>
<p>Looking at the samples ( I never used it ) , probably <span style="background-color:yellow;">web.py</span> is the best and cleanest if you only need REST . </p>
<br /><b># 11 </b><br /><p>I strongly recommend TurboGears or Bottle : </p>
<p>TurboGears : </p>
<ul>less verbose than django more flexible , less HTML-oriented but : less famous </ul>
<p>Bottle : </p>
<ul>very fast very easy to learn but : minimalistic and not mature </ul>
<br /><b># 12 </b><br /><p><span style="background-color:yellow;">web2py</span> includes support for easily building RESTful API 's , described here and here ( video ) . In particular , look at parse_as_rest , which lets you define URL patterns that map request <span style="background-color:yellow;">args</span> to database queries ; and smart_query , which enables you to pass arbitrary natural language queries in the URL . </p>
<br /><b># 13 </b><br /><p>We are working on a framework for strict REST services , check out http : //prestans.googlecode.com </p>
<p>Its in early Alpha at the moment , we are testing against mod_wsgi and Google 's AppEngine . </p>
<p>Looking for testers and feedback. Thanks . </p>
<br /><b># 14 </b><br /><p>I you are using Django then you can consider django-tastypie as an alternative to django-piston . It is easier to tune to non-ORM data sources than piston , and has great documentation . </p>
