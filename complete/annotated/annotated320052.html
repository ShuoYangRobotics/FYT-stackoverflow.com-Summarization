<h3>Question ( ID-320052 ) : </h3><h2>How do you iterate over a tree ? </h2><p>What is you preferred method of traversing a tree data structure , since recursive method calls can be pretty inefficient in some circumstances , I am simply using a generator like the one above. Do you have any hints to make it faster ? </p>
<pre><code>def children(self):
    stack = [self.entities]

                stack.append(e.entities)

<p>here is some test data : first one is recursive , second uses the generator </p>

<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>I ca n't think of any big algorithmic improvements , but a simple microoptimisation you can make is to bind frequently called methods ( such as stack.append / stack.pop ) to locals ( this saves a dictionary lookup ) </p>
<pre><code>def children(self):
    stack = [self.entities]
    push = stack.append
    pop = stack.pop
    while stack: 
        for e in pop():

            if e.entities:
                push(e.entities)

<p>This gives a small ( ~ 15 % ) speedup by my tests ( using <span style="background-color:yellow;">100</span> traversals of an 8-deep tree with 4 <span style="background-color:yellow;">children</span> at <span style="background-color:yellow;">each</span> node gives me the below timings : ) </p>

<p>Not huge , but worth doing if speed is important . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>I 'm not sure if you can reduce the overhead much on a full in-order traversal of a tree , if you use recursion the call stack will grow some , otherwise you must manually use a stack to push references of the <span style="background-color:yellow;">children</span> while visiting <span style="background-color:yellow;">each</span> node. Which way is fastest and uses less memory , depends on the <span style="background-color:yellow;">expensiveness</span> of the call stack vs. a normal stack. ( I would guess the callstack is faster since it should be optimized for its use , and recursion is much <span style="background-color:yellow;">easier</span> to implement ) </p>
<p>If you do n't care about the order you visit the nodes , some implementations of trees is actually stored in a dynamic array or linked list or stack wich you can traverse linearly if you do n't care about the order it 's traversed . </p>
<p>But why is it important to have a fast traversal anyway ? Trees are good for searching , arrays/linked lists is good for full traversal. If you often need full in-order traversal but few searches and insertions/deletions , an ordered linked list might be best , if searching is what you do most you use a tree. If the data is really massive , so that memory overhead may render recursion impossible , you should use a database . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>Recursive function calls are not incredibly inefficient , that is an old programming myth. ( If they 're badly implemented , they may incur a larger overhead than necessary , but calling them " incredibly inefficient " is plain wrong. ) </p>
<p>Remember : do n't optimize prematurely , and never optimize without benchmarking first . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>If you have a lot of RAM and the tree does n't change often , you can cache the result of the call : </p>
<pre><code>def children(self):
    if self._children_cache is not None:
        return self._children_cache
    # Put your code into collectChildren()
    self._children_cache = self.collectChildren()
    return self._children_cache
</code></pre>
<p>Whenever the tree changes , set the cache to None. In this case , using recursive calls might be more <span style="background-color:yellow;">effective</span> since the results will accumulate faster . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>I 've written iterative tree-traversal code in the past : it 's very ugly , and not fast , unless you know <span style="background-color:yellow;">exactly</span> how many <span style="background-color:yellow;">children</span> not only <span style="background-color:yellow;">each</span> subtree will have , but how many levels there are . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>I do n't know too much about Python internals of function calls , but I really ca n't imagine that your code snippet is faster than recursively traversing the tree . </p>
<p>The call stack ( used for function calls , including recursive ones ) is typically very fast. Going to the next object will only cost you a single function call. But in your snippet - where you use a stack object , going to the next object will cost you a stack.append ( possibly allocating memory on heap ) , a stack.push ( possibly freeing memory from heap ) , and a yield . </p>
<p>The main problem with recursive calls is that you might blow the stack if your tree gets too deep. This is n't likely to happen . </p>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>Here 's a pair of small corrections . </p>
<pre><code>def children(self):
    stack = [self.entities]
    for e in stack:
        yield e
        if e.entities:
            stack.extend(e.entities)
</code></pre>
<p>I actually think the generator , using append , is n't visiting all the nodes. I think you mean to <span style="background-color:yellow;">extend</span> the stack with all <span style="background-color:yellow;">entities</span> , not append a simple list of <span style="background-color:yellow;">entities</span> to the stack . </p>
<p>Also , when the for loop terminates , the while loop in your original <span style="background-color:yellow;">example</span> will also terminate because there 's no change to the <span style="background-color:yellow;">empty</span> stack after the for loop . </p>
