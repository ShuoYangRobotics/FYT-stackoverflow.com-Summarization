<h3>Question ( ID-4099042 ) : </h3><h2>sequence of vowels count </h2><p>This is not a homework question , it is an exam preparation question . </p>
<p>I should deﬁne a function <code>syllables(word)</code> that counts the number of syllables in
a word in the following way:</p>
<p></p>
<p>• a ﬁnal <strong>e</strong> in a word is not a syllable (or the vowel sequence it is a part
of).</p>
<p>I do not have to deal with any special cases, such as a ﬁnal <strong>e</strong> in a
one-syllable word (e.g., ’be’ or ’bee’).</p>
<pre><code>>>> syllables(’honour’)
2
>>> syllables(’decode’)
2
>>> syllables(’oiseau’)
2
</code></pre>
<p>Should I use <span style="background-color:yellow;">regular</span> expression here or just list comprehension ? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-9 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>Use <span style="background-color:yellow;">regexps</span> - most languages will let you count the number of matches of a <span style="background-color:yellow;">regexp</span> in a string . </p>
<p>Then special-case the terminal-e by checking the right-most match group . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>I find <span style="background-color:yellow;">regular</span> expressions natural for this question. ( I think a non-regex answer would take more coding. I use two string methods , 'lower ' and 'endswith ' to make the answer more clear. ) </p>
<pre><code>import re
def syllables(word):
    word = word.lower()
    if word.endswith('e'):
        word = word[:-1]
    count = len(re.findall('[aeiou]+', word))
    return count

for word in ('honour', 'decode', 'decodes', 'oiseau', 'pie'):
    print word, syllables(word)
</code></pre>
<p>Which prints : </p>
<pre><code>honour 2
decode 2
decodes 3
oiseau 2
pie 1
</code></pre>
<p>Note that 'decodes ' has one more syllable than 'decode ' ( which is strange , but fits your definition ) . </p>
<p>Question. How does this help you ? Is n't the point of the study question that you work through it yourself ? You may get more benefit in the future by posting a failed attempt in your question , so you can learn exactly where you are lacking . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>I do n't think <span style="background-color:yellow;">regex</span> is the right solution here . </p>
<p>It seems pretty straightforward to write this treating each string as a list . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>Some pointers : </p>
<p>[ abc ] matches a , b or c . </p>
<p>A + after a <span style="background-color:yellow;">regex</span> token allows the token to match once or more </p>
<p>$ matches the end of the string . </p>
<p>( ? &lt ; = x ) matches the current position only if the previous character is an x . </p>
<p>( ? ! x ) matches the current position only if the next character is not an x . </p>
<p>EDIT : </p>
<p>I just saw your comment that since this is not homework , actual code is <span style="background-color:yellow;">requested</span> . Well , then : </p>
<pre><code>[aeiou]+(?!(?<=e)$)
</code></pre>
<p>If you do n't want to count final vowel sequences that end in e at all ( like the u in tongue or the o in toe ) , then use </p>
<pre><code>[aeiou]+(?=[^aeiou])|[aeiou]*[aiou]$
</code></pre>
<p>I 'm sure you 'll be able to figure out how it works if you <span style="background-color:yellow;">read</span> the explanation above . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Here 's an answer without <span style="background-color:yellow;">regular</span> expressions. My <span style="background-color:yellow;">real</span> answer ( also posted ) uses <span style="background-color:yellow;">regular</span> expressions. Untested code : </p>
<pre><code>def syllables(word):
    word = word.lower()
    if word.endswith('e'):
        word = word[:-1]
    vowels = 'aeiou'
    in_vowel_group = False
    vowel_groups = 0
    for letter in word:
        if letter in vowels:
            if not in_vowel_group:
                in_vowel_group = True
                vowel_groups += 1
        else:
            in_vowel_group = False
    return vowel_groups
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>Both ways work. You said yourself that it was for exam preparation. Use whichever is going to be on the exam. If they 're both on the exam , use which you need more practice for. Just <span style="background-color:yellow;">remember</span> : </p>
<blockquote>Some people , when confronted with a problem , think " I know , I 'll use <span style="background-color:yellow;">regular</span> expressions. " Now they have two problems. ~ Jamie Zawinski </blockquote>
<p>So in my opinion , do n't use <span style="background-color:yellow;">regex</span> unless you need the practice . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>Regular expressions would be way too complex , and a list comprehension probably would n't be robust enough. You will probably be able to solve this easily using a grammar lexer like PyParsing . Give it a shot ! </p>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>Use a <span style="background-color:yellow;">regex</span> that matches a,e,i,o , or u , convert the string to a list , then iterate through the list... 1 for first true , 1 for next false , 2 for next true , 2 for next false , etc . </p>
<p>To handle the case where the last letter is 'e ' following a consonant ( as in ate ) , just check the last two letters of the <span style="background-color:yellow;">word</span> before you start. If they match that pattern truncate the final e and process as normal . </p>
<br /><b># 8 </b><br /><p>This pattern works for your definition : </p>
<pre><code>(?!e$)([aeiouy]+)
</code></pre>
<p>Just count how many times it occurs . </p>
