<h3>Question ( ID-592931 ) : </h3><h2>Why does n't Python have static variables ? </h2><p>There is a questions asking how to simulate static variables in python . </p>
<p>Also , on the web one can find many different solutions to create static variables. ( Though I have n't seen one that I like yet. ) </p>
<p>Why does n't Python support static variables in methods ? Is this considered unpythonic or has it something to do with Python 's syntax ? </p>
<p>Edit : </p>
<p>I asked specifically about the why of the design decision and I have n't provided any code example because I wanted to avoid explanation to simulate static variables . </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-9 ) : </h3><b># <span style="background-color:yellow;">0</span> </b><br /><p>The idea behind this omission is that static variables are only useful in two situations : when you really should be using a class and when you really should be using a generator . </p>
<p>If you want to attach stateful information to a <span style="background-color:yellow;">function</span> , what you need is a class. A trivially simple class , perhaps , but a class nonetheless : </p>
<pre><code>def foo(bar):
    static my_bar # doesn't work

    if not my_bar:
        my_bar = bar

    do_stuff(my_bar)

foo(bar)
foo()

# -- becomes ->

class Foo(object):
    def __init__(self, bar):
        self.bar = bar

    def __call__(self):
        do_stuff(self.bar)

foo = Foo(bar)
foo()
foo()
</code></pre>
<p>If you want your <span style="background-color:yellow;">function</span> 's behavior to change each time it 's called , what you need is a generator : </p>
<pre><code>def foo(bar):
    static my_bar # doesn't work

    if not my_bar:
        my_bar = bar

    my_bar = my_bar * 3 % 5

    return my_bar

foo(bar)
foo()

# -- becomes ->

def foogen(bar):
    my_bar = bar

    while True:
        my_bar = my_bar * 3 % 5
        yield my_bar

foo = foogen(bar)
foo.next()
foo.next()
</code></pre>
<p></p>
<pre><code>def foo():
    global bar
    do_stuff(bar)

foo()
foo()
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>One alternative to a class is a <span style="background-color:yellow;">function</span> attribute : </p>
<pre><code>def foo(arg):
    if not hasattr(foo, 'cache'):
        foo.cache = get_data_dict()
    return foo.cache[arg]
</code></pre>
<p>While a class is probably cleaner , this technique can be useful and is nicer , in my opinion , then a global . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>I think most uses of local static variables is to simulate generators , that is , having some <span style="background-color:yellow;">function</span> which performs some iteration of a process , returns the result , but mantains the state for the subsequent invocation. Python handles this very elegantly using the yield command , so it seems there is not so much need for static variables . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>It 's a design choice . </p>
<p>I 'm assuming Guido thinks you do n't need them very often , and you never really need them : you can always just use a global variable and tell everyone to keep their greasy paws offa ' your variable ; - ) </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>For caching or memoization purposes , decorators can be used as an elegant and general solution . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>In Python 3 , I would use a closure : </p>
<pre><code>def makefoo():
    x = 0
    def foo():
        nonlocal x
        x += 1
        return x
    return foo

foo = makefoo()

print(foo())
print(foo())
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>The answer 's pretty much the same as why nobody uses static methods ( even though they exist ) . You have a module-level namespace that serves about the same purpose as a class would anyway . </p>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>An ill-advised alternative : </p>
<p>You can also use the side-effects of the definition time evaluation of <span style="background-color:yellow;">function</span> defaults : </p>
<pre><code>def func(initial=0, my_static=[])
  if not my_static:
    my_static.append(initial)

   my_static[0] += 1
  return my_static[0]

print func(0), func(0), func(0)
</code></pre>
<p>Its really ugly and easily subverted , but works. Using global would be cleaner than this , imo . </p>
<br /><b># 8 </b><br /><p>From one of your comments : " I 'd like to use them to cache things loaded from disk. I think it clutters the instance less , if I could assign them to the <span style="background-color:yellow;">function</span> " </p>
<p>Use a caching class then , as a class or instance attribute to your other class. That way , you can use the full feature set of classes without cluttering other things. Also , you get a reusable tool . </p>
<p>This shows that on SO it always pays off to state one 's problem instead of asking for a specific , low level solution ( e.g. for a missing language feature ) . That way , instead of endless debates about simulating " static " ( a deprecated feature from an ancient language , in my view ) someone could have given a good answer to you problem sooner . </p>
