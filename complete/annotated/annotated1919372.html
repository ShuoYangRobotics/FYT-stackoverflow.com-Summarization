<h3>Question ( ID-1919372 ) : </h3><h2>Nested Methods ? Why are they useful ? </h2><p>So I 'm just learning some new stuff in C # &amp ; Python. Turns out both lanuages support nested methods ( C # sort of does ) . </p>
<p>Python : </p>
<pre><code>def MyMethod():

    print 'Hello from a method.'

    def MyInnerMethod():
        print 'Hello from a nested method.'

    MyInnerMethod()
</code></pre>
<p>C # ( using new features in .NET <span style="background-color:yellow;">3.5</span> ) : * </p>
<pre><code>static void Main()
{
    Console.WriteLine("Hello from main.");

    Func<int, int> NestedMethod =
        (x) =>
        {
            Console.WriteLine("In nested method. Value of x is {0}.", x);
            return x;
        };

    int result = NestedMethod(3);
}
</code></pre>
<p>So why are nested methods so important ? What makes them useful ? </p>
<p></p>
<p>* The C # code has not been tested. Feel free to edit if it does n't compile . </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-8 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>First , realize I can not give you a complete <span style="background-color:yellow;">list.</span> If you were to ask " why are screwdrivers useful ? " , I would would talk about screws and paint can lids but would miss their value in termite inspection. When you ask , " Why are nested functions useful ? " , I can tell you about scoping , closures , and entry points . </p>
<p>First , nesting can be an alternative to classes. I recently wrote some rendering code that took a file name for specialized mark-up code and returned a bitmap. This naturally lead to functions named <span style="background-color:yellow;">grab_markup_from_filename</span> ( ) and render_text_onto_image ( ) and others. The cleanest organization was one entry point named <span style="background-color:yellow;">generate_png_from_markup_filename</span> ( ) . The entry point did its job , using nested functions to accomplish its task. There was no need for a class , because there was no object with state. My alternative was to create a module with private methods hiding my helpers , but it would be messier . </p>
<pre><code>def generate_png_from_markup_filename(filename):
    def grab_markup_from_filename():
        ... 
    ... # code that calls grab_markup_from_filename() to make the image
    return image
</code></pre>
<p>Second , I use nesting for closures. The most common example is for creating decorators. The trick is that I return a reference to an inner function , so that inner function and the outer parameter value are not garbage collected . </p>
<pre><code>def verify_admin(function_to_call):
    def call_on_verify_admin(*args, **kwargs):
        if is_admin(global.session.user):
            return function_to_call(*args, **kwargs)
        else:
           throw Exception("Not Admin")
    return call_on_verify_admin  # the return value of verify_admin()
</code></pre>
<p>use it this way : </p>
<pre><code> def update_price(item, price):
     database.lookup(item).set_field('price', price)
 update_price = verify_admin(update_price)
</code></pre>
<p>or , more concisely : </p>
<pre><code> @verify_admin
 def update_price(item, price):
     database.lookup(item).set_field('price', price)
</code></pre>
<p>And yes , it should be hard to trace. Remember that " def " is just another statement . </p>
<p>So , here are two places nested classes are helpful. There are more. It is a tool . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>Nested methods are useful because there are many cases where you want to pass behaviour around , rather than just data . In many instances , it is clearer and easier to follow , in addition to being easier and faster to write , to just define that behaviour in the body of your method , where you are going to use it . </p>
<p>In .NET , LINQ is a great example of this. Suppose you wanted to create a <span style="background-color:yellow;">list</span> where each value was double its value in the original <span style="background-color:yellow;">list</span> : </p>
<pre><code>list.Select(i => i*2)
</code></pre>
<p>where i = &gt ; i * 2 is equivalent to : </p>
<pre><code>Func<int,int> double = delegate(int x) { return x*2; }
</code></pre>
<p>This is much simpler and clearer than creating a separate function . </p>
<p>Further , the function you declare may not have meaning elsewhere ( ie , outside the scope of your method ) . In C # , you can even reference to variables declared inside your method body -- which you can not do with a non-nested function . </p>
<p>Of course , you can also abuse nested functions.. . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>Nested methods also allow you to control scope of the caller as well as allowing you to access internally created members without them being exposed to other functions in a similar scope ( i.e. inside of a class ) </p>
<br /><b># <span style="background-color:yellow;">3</span> </b><br /><p>Try this Pythonish pseudocode example for a glimpse at one use-case for this technique : </p>
<pre><code>def MyMethod(base):
    base = expensivePreparation(base)
    def MyInnerMethod(some_modifier):
        doSomethingCoolWith(base, some_modifier)

    return MyInnerMethod

process = MyMethod(some_obj)
process(arg1)
process(arg2)
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Along the above mentioned points , - these can be treated as Higer order functions , functions that themselves take or return functions . </p>
<p>Checkout the sample . </p>
<pre><code>     static void Main(string[] args)
    {

        Func<int, int> NestedMethod = delegate(int x)     
        {             Console.WriteLine("In nested method. Value of x is {0}.", x);        
            return x;         
        };

        HigerOrderTest(NestedMethod)();
    }

     private static Action HigerOrderTest(Func<int, int> highFunction)
    {
          var sam = highFunction(3);

          Action DoIt =() =>
          {
              Console.WriteLine("Output is {0}.", sam);    
          };
             return DoIt;
    }
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>Nested methods increase locality of your code which is a good thing as you do n't have to pollute classes with small private methods used only in one place . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>Many useful answers here already , but here goes . </p>
<ul>inner classes : not ! nice try , but too much make-work. Nested functions / procs are much quicker and to the point. King Java 's [ 1 ] classes with one method [ 2 ] really suck , and nested functions ( or procedures ) circumvent such syntactic nonsense . functional decomposition : break a long routine into smaller ones , which are hidden from other places where they are n't used. Pascal supported this eons ago , and I 'm pretty sure it was n't a new invention even then ( early 70s ) . closures : mentioned elsewhere , but useful. use local variables in the enclosing function to initialize the generated function , and return a customized function ( or otherwise use the generated code ) </ul>

<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>You are perhaps already aware of the usefulness of passing functions to other functions , for example , providing a sort ( ) routine with a comparison function , and the obvious examples of map ( ) and filter ( ) and so on. Likewise , it is often useful to receive functions as a result from another function. The most common usage is for closures , but currying is also common . </p>
<p>A central benefit of a closure is being able to create a new function at runtime that contains all the temporal information required for its execution at that point in time. In language implementations that do n't support closures , such state management is usually done , arguably less elegantly , via classes : object instance variables are set , and then later read when needed. Closures provide a means to bundle the state with the action . </p>
<p>So as a basic point of understanding , it may help to think of nested functions as a way to write on-the-spot functions to perform very specific actions where the details of those actions will be known at runtime , but you only want to execute that action at some later time . </p>
<p>There are other things that can be done with nested functions , but you have to start somewhere . </p>
