<h3>Question ( ID-1732452 ) : </h3><h2>Django ease of building a RESTful interface </h2><p>I 'm looking for an excuse to learn Django for a new project that has come up. Typically I like to build RESTful server-side interfaces where a URL maps to <span style="background-color:yellow;">resources</span> that spits out data in some platform independent context , such as XML or JSON. This is rather straightforward to do without the use of frameworks , but some of them such as Ruby on Rails conveniently allow you to easily spit back XML to a client based on the type of URL you pass it , based on your existing model code . </p>
<p>My question is , does something like Django have support for this ? I 've googled and found some 'RESTful ' 3rd party code that can go on top of Django. Not sure if I 'm too keen on that . </p>
<p>If not Django , any other Python framework that 's already built with this in mind so I do not have to reinvent the wheel as I already have in languages like PHP ? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-6 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>This is probably pretty easy to do . </p>
<p>URL mappings are easy to construct , for example : </p>
<pre><code>urlpatterns = patterns('books.views',
  (r'^books/$', 'index'),
  (r'^books/(\d+)/$', 'get'))
</code></pre>
<p>Django supports model serialization , so it 's easy to turn <span style="background-color:yellow;">models</span> into XML : </p>
<pre><code>from django.core import serializers
from models import Book

data = serializers.serialize("xml", Book.objects.all())
</code></pre>
<p>Combine the two with decorators and you can build fast , quick <span style="background-color:yellow;">handlers</span> : </p>
<pre><code>from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404

def xml_view(func):
  def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
    result = func(*args, **kwargs)
    return HttpResponse(serializers.serialize("xml", result),
        mimetype="text/xml")
  return wrapper

@xml_view
def index(request):
  return Books.objects.all()

@xml_view
def get(request, id):
  return get_object_or_404(Book, pk=id)
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>( I had to edit out the most obvious links. ) </p>
<p>+ 1 for <span style="background-color:yellow;">piston</span> - ( link above ) . I had used <span style="background-color:yellow;">apibuilder</span> ( Washington Times open source ) in the past , but Piston works easier for me. The most difficult thing for me is in figuring out my URL structures for the API , and to help with the regular expressions. I 've also used <span style="background-color:yellow;">surlex</span> which makes that chore much easier . </p>
<p>Example , using this model for <span style="background-color:yellow;">Group</span> ( from a timetable system we 're working on ) : </p>
<pre><code>class Group(models.Model):
    """
    Tree-like structure that holds groups that may have other groups as leaves. 
    For example ``st01gp01`` is part of ``stage1``.
    This allows subgroups to work. The name is ``parents``, i.e.::

        >>> stage1group01 = Group.objects.get(unique_name = 'St 1 Gp01')
        >>> stage1group01
        >>> <Group: St 1 Gp01>
        # get the parents...
        >>> stage1group01.parents.all()
        >>> [<Group: Stage 1>]

    ``symmetrical`` on ``subgroup`` is needed to allow the 'parents' attribute to be 'visible'.
    """
    subgroup = models.ManyToManyField("Group", related_name = "parents", symmetrical= False, blank=True)
    unique_name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    academic_year = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    dept_id = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    class Meta:
        db_table = u'timetable_group'
    def __unicode__(self):
        return "%s" % self.name
</code></pre>
<p>And this urls.py fragment ( note that <span style="background-color:yellow;">surlex</span> allows regular expression macros to be set up easily ) : </p>
<pre><code>from surlex.dj import surl
from surlex import register_macro
from piston.resource import Resource
from api.handlers import GroupHandler
group_handler = Resource(GroupHandler)

# add another macro to our 'surl' function
# this picks up our module definitions
register_macro('t', r'[\w\W ,-]+')

urlpatterns = patterns('',
# group handler
# all groups
url(r'^groups/$', group_handler),
surl(r'^group/<id:#>/$', group_handler),
surl(r'^group/<name:t>/$', group_handler),)
</code></pre>
<p>Then this handler will look after JSON output ( by default ) and can also do XML and YAML . </p>
<pre><code>class GroupHandler(BaseHandler):
    """
    Entry point for Group model
    """

    allowed_methods = ('GET', )
    model = Group
    fields = ('id', 'unique_name', 'name', 'dept_id', 'academic_year', 'subgroup')

    def read(self, request, id=None, name=None):
        base = Group.objects
        if id:
            print self.__class__, 'ID'
            try:
                return base.get(id=id)
            except ObjectDoesNotExist:
                return rc.NOT_FOUND
            except MultipleObjectsReturned: # Should never happen, since we're using a primary key.
                return rc.BAD_REQUEST
        else:
            if name:
                print self.__class__, 'Name'
                return base.filter(unique_name = name).all()
            else:
                print self.__class__, 'NO ID'
                return base.all()
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see , most of the handler code is in figuring out what parameters are being passed in urlpatterns . </p>
<p>Some example URLs are <span style="background-color:yellow;">api/groups/</span> , <span style="background-color:yellow;">api/group/3301/</span> and <span style="background-color:yellow;">api/group/st1gp01/</span> - all of which will output JSON . </p>

<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>Take a look at Piston , it 's a mini-framework for Django for creating RESTful APIs . </p>
<p>A recent blog post by Eric Holscher provides some more insight on the PROs of using Piston : Large Problems in Django , Mostly Solved : APIs </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Regarding your comment about not liking 3rd party code - that 's too bad because the pluggable apps are one of <span style="background-color:yellow;">django</span> 's greatest features . Like others answered , <span style="background-color:yellow;">piston</span> will do most of the work for you . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>A little over a year ago , I wrote a REST web service in Django for a large Seattle company that does streaming media on the Internet . </p>
<p>Django was excellent for the purpose. As " a paid nerd " observed , the Django URL config is wonderful : you can set up your URLs just the way you want them , and have it serve up the appropriate objects . </p>
<p>The one thing I did n't like : the Django ORM has absolutely no support for binary BLOBs. If you want to serve up photos or something , you will need to keep them in a file system , and not in a database. Because we were using multiple servers , I had to choose between writing my own BLOB support or finding some replication framework that would keep all the servers up to date with the latest binary data. ( I chose to write my own BLOB support. It was n't very hard , so I was actually annoyed that the Django guys did n't do that work. There should be one , and preferably only one , obvious way to do something. ) </p>
<p>I really like the Django ORM. It makes the database part really easy ; you do n't need to know any SQL. ( I do n't like SQL and I do like Python , so it 's a double win. ) The " admin interface " , which you <span style="background-color:yellow;">get</span> for free , gives you a great way to look through your data , and to poke data in during testing and development . </p>
<p>I recommend Django without reservation . </p>
