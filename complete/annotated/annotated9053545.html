<h3>Question ( ID-9053545 ) : </h3><h2>Finding the sum of even valued terms in fibonacci sequence </h2><pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python2

"""
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

    even = odd + even     #Even
    if even < 4000000:

<p>My algo : </p>
<ol>If I take first 2 numbers as <span style="background-color:yellow;">0</span> , 1 ; the number that I find first in while loop will be an odd number and first of Fibonacci series . This way I calculate the even number and each time add the value of even to <span style="background-color:yellow;">total</span> . If value of even is greater than 4e6 , I break from the infinite loop . </ol>
<p>I have tried so much but my answer is always wrong. Googling says answer should be 4613732 but I always seem to get 5702886 </p>
<p>Thanks for the support . </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-7 ) : </h3><b># <span style="background-color:yellow;">0</span> </b><br /><p>Basically what you 're doing here is adding every second element of the fibonacci sequence while the question asks to only sum the even elements . </p>
<p>What you should do instead is just iterate over all the fibonacci values below 4000000 and do a if value % 2 = = <span style="background-color:yellow;">0</span> : <span style="background-color:yellow;">total</span> + = value . The % is the remainder on division operator , if the remainder when dividing by 2 equals <span style="background-color:yellow;">0</span> then the number is even . </p>
<p>E.g. : </p>
<pre><code>prev, cur = 0, 1
total = 0
while True:
    prev, cur = cur, prev + cur
    if cur >= 4000000:
        break
    if cur % 2 == 0:
        total += cur
print(total)
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>Your code includes every other term , not the even- valued ones. To see what 's going on , print even just before <span style="background-color:yellow;">total</span> + = even - you 'll see odd numbers. What you need to do instead is check the number you 're adding to the <span style="background-color:yellow;">total</span> for evenness with the modulo operator : </p>
<pre><code>total = 0
x, y = 0, 1
while y < 4000000:
    x, y = y, x + y
    if x % 2:
        continue
    total += x

print total

<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>it should be : </p>
<pre><code>odd, even = 1,0
</code></pre>
<p>Also , every third numer is even ( even + odd + odd = even ) . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>If you add every second value of the fibonacci sequence you 'll get the next fibonacci value after the last added value. For example : </p>
<pre><code>f(0) + f(2) + f(4) = f(5)
0 + 1 + 3 + 8 = 13
</code></pre>
<p>But your code currently does not add the first even value 1 . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Other answers are correct but note that to just add all even numbers in an array , just do myarray = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 55 , 89 ] </p>
<pre><code>sum(map(lambda k:k if k%2 else 0, myarray))
</code></pre>
<p>or </p>
<pre><code>sum([k if k%2 else 0 for k in [1,2,3,4,5]])
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>Every 3rd item in the Fibonnaci sequence is even. So , you could have this : </p>
<pre><code>prev, cur = 0, 1
count = 1
total = 0
while True:
    prev, cur = cur, prev + cur
    count = count + 1
    if cur >= 4000000:
        break
    if count % 3 == 0:
        total += cur
print(total)
</code></pre>
<p>or this ( changing your code as little as possible ) : </p>
<pre><code>even, odd = 0,1                       # this line was corrected
total = 0
while True:
    secondOdd = even + odd                   # this line was changed
    even = odd + secondOdd     #Even         # this line was changed
    if even < 4000000:
        total += even
        odd = secondOdd + even               # this line was added
    else:
        break
print total
</code></pre>
<hr />
<p>Another way would be ( by the use of some simple math ) to check that the sum of a2 + a5 + a8 + a11 + ... + a ( 3N + 2 ) ( the sum of even Fibonacci values ) is equal to ( a ( 3N + 4 ) -1 ) /2 . So , if you can calculate directly that number , there is no need to calculate all the previous Fibonacci numbers . </p>

    a, b = 0, 1
    while a < limit:
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

print sum(a for a in fibonacci_iter(4e6) if not (a & 1))
