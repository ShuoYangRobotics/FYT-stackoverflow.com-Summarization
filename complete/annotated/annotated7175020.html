<h3>Question ( ID-7175020 ) : </h3><h2>Python efficient way to check if very large <span style="background-color:yellow;">string</span> contains a substring </h2><p>Python is not my best language , and so I 'm not all that good at finding the most efficient solutions to some of my problems. I have a very large <span style="background-color:yellow;">string</span> ( coming from a 30 MB file ) and I need to check if that file contains a smaller substring ( this <span style="background-color:yellow;">string</span> is only a few dozen characters ) . The way I am currently doing it is : </p>
<pre><code>if small_string in large_string:
    # logic here
</code></pre>
<p>But this seems to be very inefficient because it will check every possible sequence of characters in the file. I know that there will only be an exact match on a newline , so would it be better to read the file in as a list and iterate through that list to match ? </p>
<p>EDIT : To clear up some confusion on " matching on a newline only " , here 's an example : </p>
<pre><code>small_string = "This is a line"
big_string = "This is a line\nThis is another line\nThis is yet another"
</code></pre>
<p>If I 'm not mistake , the in keyword will check all sequences , not just every line . </p>

<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>You can use one of these algorithms : </p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Although I believe KMP is more efficient , it 's more complicated to implement.The first link includes some pseudo-code that should make it very easy to implement in python . </p>
<p>you can look for alternatives here : http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_searching_algorithm </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>I do not see how to make it more optimal on the comparison , to be honest. But you can use less memory and lose less time with I/O if you read the file line by line : </p>
<pre><code>has_small_string = False
for line in large_file:
    if small_string in line:
        has_small_string = True
        break
if has_small_string:
   # ... Your stuff here ...
</code></pre>
<p>This is no revolutionary improvement , and can be even less useful if you really need the large <span style="background-color:yellow;">string</span> in the memory , but it may be helpful , so I am posting here : ) </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>Is it really slow ? You 're talking about 30MB <span style="background-color:yellow;">string</span> ; let 's try it with even bigger <span style="background-color:yellow;">string</span> : </p>
<pre><code>In [12]: string="agu82934u"*50*1024*1024+"string to be found"

In [13]: len(string)
Out[13]: 471859218

In [14]: %timeit "string to be found" in string
1 loops, best of 3: 335 ms per loop

In [15]: %timeit "string not to be found" in string
1 loops, best of 3: 200 ms per loop
</code></pre>
<p>I would n't say that 335 ms is much time looking for substring in 450MB <span style="background-color:yellow;">string</span> . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>If you just want to check if that substring exists, </p>
<pre><code>for line in open("file"):
    if substring in line:
         print "exists"
         sys.exit() # or break to do some other stuff
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>Are you implying that only a complete line will match ? ( your EDIT : matching on a newline only example seems to ) </p>
<p>Then I imagine </p>
<pre><code>for line in open('file').readlines():
  if line==small_string:
    return True
return False
</code></pre>
<p>IE , using = = is quicker than 'in ' - perhaps. I would n't be surprised if the underlying implementation of in catches the case where the line to search and the <span style="background-color:yellow;">string</span> to search for are the same length and just attempts an = = itself . </p>
<p>woudl be better . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>I would rely on fast implementation by someone else : </p>
<pre><code>import subprocess
from subprocess import STDOUT
import os

...
with open(os.devnull, 'w') as devnull:
    if subprocess.call('grep %s "%s"' % (smallstring, file), shell=True, stdout=devnull, stderr=STDOUT) == 0:
        pass #do stuff
</code></pre>
<p>Wo n't work on windows . </p>
<p>edit : I 'm worried taht grep returns 0 wheter it finds something or not. But I do n't have any <span style="background-color:yellow;">shell</span> available to me now so I ca n't test it . </p>
