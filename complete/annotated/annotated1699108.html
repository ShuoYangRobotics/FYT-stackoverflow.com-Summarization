<h3>Question ( ID-1699108 ) : </h3><h2>Local import statements in Python </h2><p>I think putting the import statement as close to the fragment that uses it helps readability by making its dependencies more clear. Will Python cache this ? Should I care ? Is this a bad idea ? </p>
<pre><code>def Process():
    import StringIO
    file_handle=StringIO.StringIO('hello world')
    #do more stuff

for i in xrange(10): Process()
</code></pre>
<p>A little more justification : it 's for methods which use arcane bits of the library , but when I refactor the method into another file , I do n't realize I missed the external dependency until I get a runtime error . </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-6 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>The other answers evince a mild confusion as to how import really works . </p>
<p>This statement : </p>
<pre><code>import foo
</code></pre>
<p>is roughly equivalent to this statement : </p>
<pre><code>foo = __import__('foo', globals(), locals(), [], -1)
</code></pre>
<p>That is , it creates a variable in the current scope with the same name as the requested module , and assigns it the result of calling __import__ ( ) with that module name and a boatload of default arguments . </p>
<p>The __import__ ( ) function handles conceptually converts a string ( 'foo ' ) into a module object. Modules are cached in <span style="background-color:yellow;">sys.modules</span> , and that 's the first place __import__ ( ) looks--if <span style="background-color:yellow;">sys.modules</span> has an entry for 'foo ' , that 's what __import__ ( 'foo ' ) will return , whatever it is. It really does n't care about the type. You can see this in action yourself ; try running the following code : </p>
<pre><code>import sys
sys.modules['boop'] = (1, 2, 3)
import boop
print boop
</code></pre>
<p>Leaving aside stylistic concerns for the moment , having an import statement inside a function works how you 'd want. If the module has never been imported before , it gets imported and cached in <span style="background-color:yellow;">sys.modules.</span> It then assigns the module to the local variable with that name. It does not not not modify any module-level state. It does possibly modify some global state ( adding a new entry to <span style="background-color:yellow;">sys.modules</span> ) . </p>
<p>That said , I almost never use " import " inside a function. If importing the module creates a noticeable slowdown in your program--like it performs a long computation in its static initialization , or it 's simply a massive module--and your program rarely actually needs the module for anything , it 's perfectly fine to have the import only inside the functions in which it 's used. ( If this was <span style="background-color:yellow;">distasteful</span> , Guido would jump in his time machine and change Python to prevent us from doing it. ) But as a rule , I and the general Python community put all our import statements at the top of the module in module scope . </p>
<br /><b># <span style="background-color:yellow;">1</span> </b><br /><p>I 've done this , and then wished I had n't. Ordinarily , if I 'm writing a function , and that function needs to use <span style="background-color:yellow;">StringIO</span> , I can look at the top of the module , see if it 's being imported , and then add it if it 's not . </p>
<p>Suppose I do n't do this ; suppose I add it locally within my function. And then suppose at someone point I , or someone else , adds a bunch of other functions that use <span style="background-color:yellow;">StringIO</span> . That person is going to look at the top of the module and add import <span style="background-color:yellow;">StringIO</span> . Now your function contains code that 's not only unexpected but redundant . </p>
<p>Also , it violates what I think is a pretty important principle : do n't directly modify module-level state from inside a function . </p>
<p>Edit : </p>
<p>Actually , it turns out that all of the above is nonsense . </p>
<p>Importing a module does n't modify module-level state ( it initializes the module being imported , if nothing else has yet , but that 's not at all the same thing ) . Importing a module that you 've already imported elsewhere costs you nothing except a lookup to <span style="background-color:yellow;">sys.modules</span> and creating a variable in the local scope . </p>
<p>Knowing this , I feel kind of dumb fixing all of the places in my code where I fixed it , but that 's my cross to bear . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>Please see PEP 8 : </p>
<blockquote>Imports are always put at the top of the file , just after any module comments and docstrings , and before module globals and constants . </blockquote>
<p>Please note that this is purely a stylistic choice as Python will treat all import statements the same regardless of where they are declared in the source file. Still I would recommend that you follow common practice as this will make your code more readable to others . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>Style aside , it is true that an imported module will only be imported once ( unless reload is called on said module ) . However , each call to import <span style="background-color:yellow;">Foo</span> will have implicitly check to see if that module is already loaded ( by checking <span style="background-color:yellow;">sys.modules</span> ) . </p>
<p>Consider also the " <span style="background-color:yellow;">disassembly</span> " of two otherwise equal functions where one tries to import a module and the other does n't : </p>
<pre><code>>>> def Foo():
...     import random
...     return random.randint(1,100)
... 
>>> dis.dis(Foo)
  2           0 LOAD_CONST               1 (-1)
              3 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)
              6 IMPORT_NAME              0 (random)
              9 STORE_FAST               0 (random)

  3          12 LOAD_FAST                0 (random)
             15 LOAD_ATTR                1 (randint)
             18 LOAD_CONST               2 (1)
             21 LOAD_CONST               3 (100)
             24 CALL_FUNCTION            2
             27 RETURN_VALUE        
>>> def Bar():
...     return random.randint(1,100)
... 
>>> dis.dis(Bar)
  2           0 LOAD_GLOBAL              0 (random)
              3 LOAD_ATTR                1 (randint)
              6 LOAD_CONST               1 (1)
              9 LOAD_CONST               2 (100)
             12 CALL_FUNCTION            2
             15 RETURN_VALUE

<p>I 'm not sure how much more the bytecode gets translated for the virtual machine , but if this was an important inner loop to your program , you 'd certainly want to put some weight on the <span style="background-color:yellow;">Bar</span> approach over the <span style="background-color:yellow;">Foo</span> approach . </p>
<p>A quick and dirty timeit test does show a modest speed improvement when using <span style="background-color:yellow;">Bar</span> : </p>
<pre><code>$ python -m timeit -s "from a import Foo,Bar" -n 200000 "Foo()"
200000 loops, best of 3: 10.3 usec per loop
$ python -m timeit -s "from a import Foo,Bar" -n 200000 "Bar()"
200000 loops, best of 3: 6.45 usec per loop

<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>When the python interpreter hits an import statement , it starts reading all the function definitions in the file that is being imported. This explains why sometimes , imports can take a while . </p>
<p>The idea behind doing all the importing at the start IS a stylistic convention as Andrew Hare points out. However , you have to keep in mind that by doing so , you are implicitly making the interpreter check if this file has already been imported after the first time you import it. It also becomes a problem when your code file becomes large and you want to " upgrade " your code to remove or replace certain dependencies. This will require you to search your whole code file to find all the places where you have imported this module . </p>
<p>I would suggest following convention and keeping the imports at the top of your code file. If you really do want to keep track of dependencies for functions , then I would suggest adding them in the docstring for that function . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>I can see two ways when you need to import it locally </p>
<ol>For testing purpose or for temporary usage , you need to import something , in that case you should put import at the place of usage . Sometime to avoid cyclic dependency you will need to import it inside a function but that would mean you have problem else where . </ol>
<p>Otherwise always put it at top for efficiency and consistency sake . </p>
