<h3>Question ( ID-2247140 ) : </h3><h2>How can I filter a <span style="background-color:yellow;">pcap</span> file by specific protocol using python ? </h2><p>I have some <span style="background-color:yellow;">pcap</span> files and I want to filter by protocol , i.e. , if I want to filter by HTTP protocol , anything but HTTP packets will remain in the <span style="background-color:yellow;">pcap</span> file . </p>
<p>There is a tool called openDPI , and it 's perfect for what I need , but there is no wrapper for python language . </p>
<p>Does anyone knows any python modules that can do what I need ? </p>
<p>Thanks </p>
<p>Edit 1 : </p>
<p>HTTP filtering was just an example , there is a lot of protocols that I want to filter . </p>
<p>Edit 2 : </p>
<p>I tried Scapy , but I do n't figure how to filter correctly. The filter only accepts Berkeley Packet Filter expression , i.e. , I ca n't apply a msn , or HTTP , or another specific filter from upper layer. Can anyone help me ? </p>

from pcapy import open_offline

<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>A quick example using Scapy , since I just wrote one : </p>
<pre><code>pkts = rdpcap('packets.pcap')
ports = [80, 25]
filtered = (pkt for pkt in pkts if
    TCP in pkt and
    (pkt[TCP].sport in ports or pkt[TCP].dport in ports))
wrpcap('filtered.pcap', filtered)
</code></pre>
<p>That will filter out packets that are neither HTTP nor SMTP. If you want all the packets but HTTP and SMTP , the third line should be : </p>
<pre><code>filtered = (pkt for pkt in pkts if
    not (TCP in pkt and
    (pkt[TCP].sport in ports or pkt[TCP].dport in ports)))
wrpcap('filtered.pcap', filtered)
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>I know this is a super-old question , but I just ran across it thought I 'd provide my answer. This is a problem I 've encountered several times over the years , and I keep finding myself falling back to <span style="background-color:yellow;">dpkt</span> . Originally from the very capable dugsong , <span style="background-color:yellow;">dpkt</span> is primarily a packet creation/parsing library. I get the sense the <span style="background-color:yellow;">pcap</span> parsing was an afterthought , but it turns out to be a very useful one , because parsing <span style="background-color:yellow;">pcaps</span> , IP , TCP and and TCP headers is straightforward. It 's parsing all the higher-level protocols that becomes the time sink ! ( I wrote my own python <span style="background-color:yellow;">pcap</span> parsing library before finding <span style="background-color:yellow;">dpkt</span> ) </p>
<p>The documentation on using the <span style="background-color:yellow;">pcap</span> parsing functionality is a little thin. Here 's an example from my files : </p>
<pre><code>import socket
import dpkt
import sys
pcapReader = dpkt.pcap.Reader(file(sys.argv[1], "rb"))
for ts, data in pcapReader:
    ether = dpkt.ethernet.Ethernet(data)
    if ether.type != dpkt.ethernet.ETH_TYPE_IP: raise
    ip = ether.data
    src = socket.inet_ntoa(ip.src)
    dst = socket.inet_ntoa(ip.dst)
    print "%s -> %s" % (src, dst)

<p>Hope this helps the next guy to run across this post ! </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Try pylibpcap . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>to filter in/out a specific protocol you have to do a per packet analysis otherwise you could miss some http traffic on a non-conventional port that is flowing in your network. of course if you want a loose <span style="background-color:yellow;">system</span> , you could check just for source and destination port number but that wont give you exact results. you have to look for specific feature of a protocol like GET , POST , HEAD etc keywords for HTTP and others for other protocol and check each TCP packets . </p>
