<h3>Question ( ID-746774 ) : </h3><h2>Basic python. Quick question regarding calling a function </h2><p>I 've got a basic problem in python , and I would be glad for some help : - ) </p>
<p>I have two functions. One that convert a <span style="background-color:yellow;">text</span> file to a dictionary. And one that splits a sentence into separate words : </p>
<p>( This is the <span style="background-color:yellow;">functiondoc.txt</span> ) </p>
<pre><code>def autoparts():

    list_of_parts= open('list_of_parts.txt', 'r')
    for line in list_of_parts:
        k, v= line.split()
        list1.append(k)
        list2.append(v)

    dictionary = dict(zip(k, v))

def splittext(text):
    words = text.split()

    print words
</code></pre>
<p>Now I want to make a program that uses these two functions . </p>
<p>( this is the program.txt ) </p>
<pre><code>from functiondoc import *

# A and B are keys in the dict. The values are 'rear_bumper' 'back_seat'
text = 'A B'    # Input

# Splits the input into separate strings.
input_ = split_line(text)
</code></pre>
<p>Here 's the part I cant get right. I need to use the <span style="background-color:yellow;">autoparts</span> function to output the <span style="background-color:yellow;">values</span> ( rear_bumper back_seat ) , but I 'm not sure how to call that function so it does that. I do n't think it 's that hard. But I ca n't figure it out.. . </p>
<p>Kind Regards, </p>

<ul>You should not name Python source files " .txt " , you should use " .py " . Your indents look wrong , but that might just be Stack Overflow . You need to call the <span style="background-color:yellow;">autoparts</span> ( ) function to set up the dictionary . The <span style="background-color:yellow;">autoparts</span> ( ) function should probably return the dictionary , to make it usable by other code . When open ing a <span style="background-color:yellow;">text</span> file , you should use the t mode specifier. On some platforms , the lower-level I/O code must <span style="background-color:yellow;">know</span> that it is reading <span style="background-color:yellow;">text</span> , so you need to tell it . </ul>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>In addition to all of the other hints and tips , I think you 're missing something crucial : your functions actually need to return something . </p>
<p>When you create <span style="background-color:yellow;">autoparts</span> ( ) or <span style="background-color:yellow;">splittext</span> ( ) , the idea is that this will be a function that you can call , and it can ( and should ) give something back . </p>
<p>Once you figure out the output that you want your function to have , you need to put it in a return statement . </p>
<p>For example , if you wanted to <span style="background-color:yellow;">splittext</span> to return the list of words , rather than print them , you would need the line return words . If you want your <span style="background-color:yellow;">autoparts</span> to return the dictionary you 've built , you would use return dictionary . </p>
<p>To be more precise ( and to answer your comment/question below ) : you do n't want to " return a function that makes a dictionary " ; you want to return the dictionary while inside the function. So , the last line of your function should be return dictionary ( inside the function ! ) See , for example , the ( accepted ! ) solution from dbr , above . </p>
<p>I think you need to go back to the beginning and read a book or website about python in particular and programming in general , since you are slightly rusty on some of the concepts. One good one ( others are available , of course ) is http : //diveintopython.org/ </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>As people have pointed out , you need to use the py extension for python source files. Your files would become " <span style="background-color:yellow;">functiondoc.py</span> " and " program.py " . This will make your import <span style="background-color:yellow;">functiondoc</span> work correctly ( as long as they are in the same directory ) </p>
<p>The biggest problem with the <span style="background-color:yellow;">autoparts</span> function is you never returned anything. The other big problem is you used the wrong <span style="background-color:yellow;">variable.</span> . </p>
<pre><code>for line in list_of_parts:
    k, v = line.split()
    list1.append(k)
    list2.append(v)

# k and v are now the last line split up, *not* the list you've been constructing.
# The following incorrect line:
dictionary = dict(zip(k, v))
# ...should be:
dictionary = dict(zip(list1, list2))
# ..although you shouldn't use zip for this:
</code></pre>
<p>You almost never have to use zip , there are times when it can be useful , but for creating a simple dict , it 's incorrect.. Instead of doing. . </p>
<pre><code>for line in list_of_parts:
    ...
dictionary = dict(zip(k, v))
</code></pre>
<p>..simply create an empty dict before the loop , then do mydict [ <span style="background-color:yellow;">key_variable</span> ] = <span style="background-color:yellow;">value_variable</span> </p>
<p>For example , how I might have written the function. . </p>
<pre><code>def autoparts():
    # open() returns a file object, not the contents of the file,
    # you need to use .read() or .readlines() to get the actual text
    input_file = open('list_of_parts.txt', 'r')
    all_lines = input_file.read_lines() # reads files as a list (one index per line)

    mydict = {} # initialise a empty dictionary

    for line in list_of_parts:
        k, v = line.split()
        mydict[k] = v

    return mydict # you have to explicitly return stuff, or it returns None
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>Do n't bother creating the lists first , just go straight to the dictionary : </p>
<pre><code>parts_dict={}
list_of_parts = open('list_of_parts.txt', 'r')
for line in list_of_parts:
        k, v = line.split()
        parts_dict[k] = v
</code></pre>
<p>Also , are these <span style="background-color:yellow;">keys</span> unique ? Because if not some of the <span style="background-color:yellow;">values</span> will get overwritten . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>There are a lot of problems with what you 've written so far , but your question was how to call the auto parts function. Here 's how ; first , rename your files to <span style="background-color:yellow;">functiondocs.py</span> and program.py - they 're python so make them python files . </p>
<p>Next , to call the <span style="background-color:yellow;">autoparts</span> function , you simply change your main program listing from : </p>
<pre><code>from functiondoc import *

# A and B are keys in the dict. The values are 'rear_bumper' 'back_seat'
text = 'A B'    # Input

# Splits the input into separate strings.
input_ = split_line(text)
</code></pre>
<p>to : </p>
<pre><code>from functiondoc import *

# Call the autparts function
autoparts()
</code></pre>
<p>In my opinion , it looks like you 're asking us to do a CS homework assignment.. but maybe I 'm just cynical ; - ) </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>Here 's about the simplest way you could do this : </p>
<pre><code>def filetodict(filename):
    return dict(line.split() for line in open(filename))

parts = filetodict("list_of_parts.txt")
print parts
</code></pre>
<p>Here 's the output : </p>
<pre><code>{'a': 'apple', 'c': 'cheese', 'b': 'bacon', 'e': 'egg', 'd': 'donut'}
</code></pre>
<p>The file contents : </p>
<pre><code>a apple
b bacon
c cheese
d donut
e egg
</code></pre>
