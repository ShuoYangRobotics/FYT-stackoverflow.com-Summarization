<h3>Question ( ID-3393431 ) : </h3><h2>How to <span style="background-color:yellow;">counting</span> not 0 elements in an <span style="background-color:yellow;">iterable</span> ? </h2><p>I 'm looking for a better/more Pythonic solution for the following snippet </p>
<pre><code>count = sum(1 for e in iterable if e)
</code></pre>

<p>Using None as the predicate for filter just says to use the truthiness of the <span style="background-color:yellow;">items.</span> ( maybe clearer would be len ( filter ( bool , <span style="background-color:yellow;">iterable</span> ) ) ) </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>Honestly , I ca n't think of a better way to do <span style="background-color:yellow;">it</span> than what you 've got . </p>
<p>Well , I guess people could argue about " better , " but I think you 're unlikely to find anything shorter , simpler , and clearer . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>Most Pythonic is to write a small auxiliary function and put <span style="background-color:yellow;">it</span> in your trusty " utilities " module ( or submodule of appropriate package , when you have enough ; - ) : </p>
<pre><code>import itertools as it

def count(iterable):
  """Return number of items in iterable."""
  return sum(1 for _ in iterable)

def count_conditional(iterable, predicate=None):
  """Return number of items in iterable that satisfy the predicate."""
  return count(it.ifilter(predicate, iterable))
</code></pre>
<p>Exactly how you choose to implement these utilities is less important ( you could choose at any time to recode some of them in Cython , for example , if some profiling on an application using the utilities shows <span style="background-color:yellow;">it</span> 's useful ) : the key thing is having them as your own useful library of utility functions , with names and calling patterns you like , to make your all-important application level code clearer , more readable , and more concise that if you stuffed <span style="background-color:yellow;">it</span> full of inlined contortions ! - ) </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><pre><code>sum(not not e for e in iterable)
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>This is n't the fastest , but maybe handy for code-golf </p>
<pre><code>sum(map(bool, iterable))
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>If you 're just trying to see whether the <span style="background-color:yellow;">iterable</span> is not empty , then this would probably help : </p>
<pre><code>def is_iterable_empty(it):
    try:
        iter(it).next()
    except StopIteration:
        return True
    else:
        return False
</code></pre>
<p>The other answers will take O ( N ) time to complete ( and some take O ( N ) memory ; good eye , John ! ) . This function takes O ( 1 ) time. If you really need the length , then the other answers will help you more . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>Propably the most Pythonic way is to write code that does not need <span style="background-color:yellow;">count</span> function . </p>
<p>Usually fastest is to write the style of functions that you are best with and continue to refine your style . </p>
<p>Write Once Read Often code . </p>
<p>By the way your code does not do what your title says ! To <span style="background-color:yellow;">count</span> not 0 elements is not simple considering rounding errors in floating numbers , that False is 0. . </p>
<p>If you have not floating point values in <span style="background-color:yellow;">list</span> , this could do <span style="background-color:yellow;">it</span> : </p>
<pre><code>def nonzero(seq):
  return (item for item in seq if item!=0) 

seq = [None,'', 0, 'a', 3,[0], False] 
print seq,'has',len(list(nonzero(seq))),'non-zeroes' 

print 'Filter result',len(filter(None, seq))

"""Output:
[None, '', 0, 'a', 3, [0], False] has 5 non-zeroes
Filter result 3
"""
