<h3>Question ( ID-1006169 ) : </h3><h2>How do I look inside a Python <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> ? </h2><p>I 'm starting to code in various projects using Python ( including Django web development and Panda3D game development ) . To help me understand whats going on , I would like to basically 'look ' inside the Python <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> to see how they tick - like their methods and properties. So say I have a Python <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> , what could would I need to print out it 's contents ? Is that even possible ? </p>
<p>Thanks . </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-11 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>Python has a strong set of introspection features . </p>
<p>Take a look at the following built-in functions : </p>
<ul>type ( ) dir ( ) id ( ) getattr ( ) hasattr ( ) globals ( ) locals ( ) callable ( ) </ul>
<p>type ( ) and dir ( ) are particularly useful for inspecting the type of an <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> and its set of attributes , respectively . </p>
<p>Here is an online resource worth perusing : Dive Into Python Chapter 4 : The Power of Introspection </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>First , read the source . </p>
<p>Second , use the dir ( ) function . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>If this is for exploration to see what 's going on , I 'd recommend looking at IPython . This adds various shortcuts to obtain an <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> documentation , properties and even source code. For instance appending a " ? " to a function will give the help for the <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> ( effectively a shortcut for " help ( obj ) " , wheras using two ? 's ( " func ? ? " ) will display the sourcecode if it is available . </p>
<p>There are also a lot of additional conveniences , like tab completion , pretty printing of results , result history etc. that make it very handy for this sort of exploratory programming . </p>
<p>For more programmatic use of introspection , the basic builtins like dir ( ) , vars ( ) , getattr etc will be useful , but it is well worth your time to check out the inspect module. To fetch the source of a function , use " inspect.getsource " eg , applying it to itself : </p>
<pre><code>>>> print inspect.getsource(inspect.getsource)
def getsource(object):
    """Return the text of the source code for an object.

    The argument may be a module, class, method, function, traceback, frame,
    or code object.  The source code is returned as a single string.  An
    IOError is raised if the source code cannot be retrieved."""
    lines, lnum = getsourcelines(object)
    return string.join(lines, '')
</code></pre>
<p>inspect.getargspec is also frequently useful if you 're dealing with wrapping or manipulating functions , as it will give the names and default values of function parameters . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>You can list the attributes of a <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> with dir ( ) in the shell : </p>
<pre><code>>>> dir(object())
['__class__', '__delattr__', '__doc__', '__format__', '__getattribute__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__setattr__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__']
</code></pre>
<p>Of course , there is also the inspect module : http : //docs.python.org/library/inspect.html # module-inspect </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>pprint and dir together work great </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p><span style="background-color:yellow;">object.__dict__</span> </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>Others have already mentioned the dir ( ) built-in which sounds like what you 're looking for , but here 's another good tip. Many libraries -- including most of the standard library -- are distributed in source form. Meaning you can pretty easily read the source code directly. The trick is in finding it ; for example : </p>
<pre><code>>>> import string
>>> string.__file__
'/usr/lib/python2.5/string.pyc'
</code></pre>
<p>The * .pyc file is compiled , so remove the trailing 'c ' and open up the uncompiled * .py file in your favorite editor or file viewer : </p>
<pre><code>/usr/lib/python2.5/string.py
</code></pre>
<p>I 've found this incredibly useful for discovering things like which exceptions are raised from a given API. This kind of detail is rarely well-documented in the Python world . </p>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>I 'm surprised no one 's mentioned help yet ! </p>
<pre><code>In [1]: def foo():
   ...:     "foo!"
   ...:

In [2]: help(foo)
Help on function foo in module __main__:

foo()
    foo!
</code></pre>
<p>Help lets you read the docstring and get an idea of what attributes a class might have , which is pretty helpful . </p>

def info(object, spacing=10, collapse=1):
    """Print methods and doc strings.

methodList = [e for e in dir(object) if callable(getattr(object, e))]
processFunc = collapse and (lambda s: " ".join(s.split())) or (lambda s: s)

<br /><b># 9 </b><br /><p>In addition if you want to look inside list and dictionaries , you can use pprint ( ) </p>
<br /><b># 10 </b><br /><p>If you want to look at parameters and methods , as others have pointed out you may well use pprint or dir ( ) </p>
<p>If you want to see the actual value of the contents , you can do </p>
<p><span style="background-color:yellow;">object.__dict__</span> </p>
