<h3>Question ( ID-1988484 ) : </h3><h2>Python lists with STL like <span style="background-color:yellow;">interface</span> </h2><p>I have to port a C + + STL application to Python. I am a Python newbie , but have been programming for over a decade. I have a great deal of experience with the STL , and find that <span style="background-color:yellow;">it</span> keeps me hooked to using C + + . I have been searching for the following <span style="background-color:yellow;">items</span> on Google these past several days : </p>
<ol>Python STL ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">in</span> hope of leveraging my years of STL experience ) Python linked lists Python advanced list usage Python list optimization Python ordered sets </ol>
<p>And have found posts about the above topic , tutorials on Python lists that are decidedly NOT advanced , or dead ends. I am really surprised at my lack of success , I think I am just burned out from overworking and entering bad search terms ! </p>
<p>( MY QUESTION ) Can I get a Python STL wrapper , or an <span style="background-color:yellow;">interface</span> to Python lists that works like the STL ? If not can someone point me to a truly advanced tutorial or paper on managing very large sorted collections of non trivial objects ? </p>
<p>P.S. I can easily <span style="background-color:yellow;">implement</span> workarounds for one or two uses , but <span style="background-color:yellow;">if</span> management wants to port more code , I want to be ready to replace any STL code I find with equivalent Python code <span style="background-color:yellow;">immediately.</span> And YES I HAVE MEASURED AND DO NEED TO HAVE TOTALLY OPTIMAL CODE ! I CANT JUST DO REDUNDANT SORTS AND SEARCHES ! </p>
<p>( ADDENDUM ) Thanks for the replies , I have checked out some of the references and am pleased. In response to some of the comments here : </p>
<p>1 - It <span style="background-color:yellow;">is</span> being ported to python because managements says so , I would just as soon leave <span style="background-color:yellow;">it</span> alone - <span style="background-color:yellow;">if</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">it</span> aint broke , why fix <span style="background-color:yellow;">it</span> ? </p>
<p>2 - Advanced list usage with non trivial objects , what I mean by that <span style="background-color:yellow;">is</span> : Many different ways to order and compare objects , not by one cmp method. I want to splice , sort , merge , search , <span style="background-color:yellow;">insert</span> , erase , and combine the lists extensively. I want lists of list <span style="background-color:yellow;">iterators</span> , I want to avoid copying . </p>
<p>3 - I now know that built <span style="background-color:yellow;">in</span> lists are actually arrays , and I should be looking for a different python class. I think this was the root of my confusion . </p>
<p>4 - Of course I am learning to do things <span style="background-color:yellow;">in</span> the Python way , but I also have deadlines. The STL code I am porting <span style="background-color:yellow;">is</span> working right , I would like to change <span style="background-color:yellow;">it</span> as little as possible , because that would <span style="background-color:yellow;">introduce</span> bugs . </p>
<p>Thanks to everyone for their <span style="background-color:yellow;">input</span> , I really appreciate <span style="background-color:yellow;">it</span> . </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-6 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>If I were you I would take the time to learn how to properly use the various data structures available <span style="background-color:yellow;">in</span> Python <span style="background-color:yellow;">instead</span> of looking for things that are similar to what you know from C + + . </p>
<p>It 's not like you 're looking for something fancy , just working with some data structures. In that case I would refer you to Python 's documentation on the subject . </p>
<p>Doing this the 'Python ' way would help you and more <span style="background-color:yellow;">importantly</span> future maintainers who will wonder why you try to program C + + <span style="background-color:yellow;">in</span> Python . </p>
<p>Just to whet your appetite , there 's also no reason to prefer STL 's style to Python ( and for the record , I 'm also a C + + programmer who knows STL throughly ) , consider the most trivial example of constructing a list and traversing <span style="background-color:yellow;">it</span> : </p>
<p>The Pythonic way : </p>
<pre><code>mylist = [1, 2, 3, 4]

for value in mylist:
    # playaround with value
</code></pre>
<p>The STL way ( I made this up , to resemble STL ) <span style="background-color:yellow;">in</span> Python : </p>
<pre><code>mylist = [1, 2, 3, 4]
mylistiter = mylist.begin()

while mylistiter != mylist.end():
    value = mylistiter.item()
    mylistiter.next()
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>Python 's " lists " are not linked lists -- they 're like Java ArrayList s or C + + 's std : : vector s , <span style="background-color:yellow;">i.e.</span> , <span style="background-color:yellow;">in</span> lower-level terms , a resizable compact array of pointers . </p>
<p>A good " advanced tutorial " on such subjects <span style="background-color:yellow;">is</span> Hettinger 's Core Python containers : under the hood presentation ( the video at the URL <span style="background-color:yellow;">is</span> of the presentation at an Italian conference , but <span style="background-color:yellow;">it</span> 's <span style="background-color:yellow;">in</span> English ; another , shorter presentation of essentially the same talk <span style="background-color:yellow;">is</span> here ) . </p>
<p>So the performance characteristics of Python lists are essentially those of C + + 's std : : vector : Python 's .append , like C + + 's push_back , <span style="background-color:yellow;">is</span> O ( 1 ) , but <span style="background-color:yellow;">insertion</span> or removal " <span style="background-color:yellow;">in</span> the middle " <span style="background-color:yellow;">is</span> O ( N ) . Consequently , keeping a list sorted ( as can be easily done with the help of functions <span style="background-color:yellow;">in</span> Python 's standard library module bisect ) <span style="background-color:yellow;">is</span> costly ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">if</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">items</span> arrive and/or depart randomly , each <span style="background-color:yellow;">insertion</span> and removal <span style="background-color:yellow;">is</span> O ( N ) , just like similarly maintaining order <span style="background-color:yellow;">in</span> an std : : vector would be. For some purposes , such as priority queues , you may get away with a " heap queue " , also easy to maintain with the help of functions <span style="background-color:yellow;">in</span> Python 's standard library module heapq -- but of course that does n't afford the same range of uses as a completely sorted list ( or vector ) would . </p>
<p>So for purposes for which <span style="background-color:yellow;">in</span> C + + you 'd use a std : : set ( and rely on <span style="background-color:yellow;">its</span> being ordered , <span style="background-color:yellow;">i.e.</span> , a hashset would n't do -- Python 's set s are hash-based , not ordered ) you may be better off avoiding Python builtin containers <span style="background-color:yellow;">in</span> favor of something like this module ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">if</span> you need to keep things pure-Python ) , or this one ( which offers AVL trees , not RB ones , but <span style="background-color:yellow;">is</span> coded as a C-implemented Python extension and so may offer better performance ) <span style="background-color:yellow;">if</span> C-coded extensions are OK . </p>
<p>If you do end up using your own module ( be <span style="background-color:yellow;">it</span> pure Python , or C-coded ) , you may , <span style="background-color:yellow;">if</span> you wish , give <span style="background-color:yellow;">it</span> an STL-like veneer/interface ( with .begin , .end , <span style="background-color:yellow;">iterator</span> objects that are advanced by <span style="background-color:yellow;">incrementing</span> rather than , as per normal Python behavior , by calling their next methods , ... ) , although <span style="background-color:yellow;">it</span> will never perform as well as " going with the grain " of the language would ( the for statement <span style="background-color:yellow;">is</span> optimized to use normal Python <span style="background-color:yellow;">iterators</span> , <span style="background-color:yellow;">i.e.</span> , one with next methods , and <span style="background-color:yellow;">it</span> will be faster than wrapping a somewhat awkward while around non-Python-standard , STL-like <span style="background-color:yellow;">iterators</span> ) . </p>
<p>To give an STL-like veneer to any Python built-in container , you 'll <span style="background-color:yellow;">incur</span> substantial wrapping overhead , so the performance hit may be considerable. If you , as you say , " DO NEED TO HAVE TOTALLY OPTIMAL CODE " , using such a veneer just for " syntax convenience " purposes would therefore seem to be a very bad choice . </p>
<p>Boost Python , the Python extension package that wraps the powerful C + + Boost library , might perhaps serve your purposes best . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>For linked-list-like operations people usually use collections.deque . </p>
<p>What operations do you need to perform fast ? Bisection ? Insertion ? </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>I would say that your <span style="background-color:yellow;">issues</span> go beyond just STL porting. Since the list , dict , and set data structures , which are bolted on to C + + via the STL , are native to core Python , then their usage <span style="background-color:yellow;">is</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">incorporated</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">into</span> common Python code <span style="background-color:yellow;">idioms.</span> If you want to give Google another shot , try looking for references for " Python for C + + Programmers " . One of your hits will be this presentation by Alex Martelli . It 's a little dated , from way back <span style="background-color:yellow;">in</span> ought-three , but there <span style="background-color:yellow;">is</span> a side-by-side comparison of some basic Python code that reads through a text file , and how <span style="background-color:yellow;">it</span> would look using STL . </p>
<p>From there , I would recommend that you read up on these Python features : </p>
<ul><span style="background-color:yellow;">iterators</span> generators list and generator comprehensions </ul>
<p>And these builtin functions : </p>
<ul>zip map </ul>
<p>Once you are familiar with these , then you will be able to construct your own translation/mapping between STL usage and Python builtin data structures . </p>
<p>As others have said , <span style="background-color:yellow;">if</span> you are looking for a " plug-and-chug " formula to convert STL C + + code to Python , you will just end up with bad Python. Such a brute force approach will never result <span style="background-color:yellow;">in</span> the power , elegance , and brevity of a single-line list comprehension. ( I had this very experience when <span style="background-color:yellow;">introducing</span> Python to one of our managers , who was familiar with Java and C + + <span style="background-color:yellow;">iterators.</span> When I showed him this code : </p>
<pre><code>numParams = 1000
paramRequests = [ ("EqptEmulator/ProcChamberI/Sensors", 
                   "ChamberIData%d"%(i%250)) for i in range(numParams) ]
record.internalArray = [ParameterRequest(*pr) for pr in paramRequests]
</code></pre>
<p>and I explained that these replaced this code ( or something like <span style="background-color:yellow;">it</span> , this might be a mishmash of C + + and Java APIs , sorry ) : </p>
<pre><code>std::vector<ParameterRequest> prs = new std::vector<ParameterRequest>();
for (int i = 0; i<1000; ++i) {
    string idstr;
    strstream sstr(idstr);
    sstr << "ChamberIData" << (i%250);
    prs.add(new ParameterRequest("EqptEmulator/ProcChamberI/Sensors", idstr));
}
record.internalArray = new ParameterRequest[prs.size];
prs.toArray(record.internalArray);
</code></pre>
<p>One of your <span style="background-color:yellow;">instincts</span> from working with C + + will be a reluctance to create new lists from old , but rather to update or filter a list <span style="background-color:yellow;">in</span> place. We even see this on many forums from Python developers asking about how to modify a list while <span style="background-color:yellow;">iterating</span> over <span style="background-color:yellow;">it.</span> In Python , you are much better off building a new list from the old with a list comprehension . </p>
<pre><code>allItems = [... some list of items, perhaps from a database query ...]
validItems = [it for it in allItems if it.isValid()]
</code></pre>
<p>As opposed to : </p>
<pre><code>validItems = []
for it in allItems:
    if it.isValid():
        validItems.add(it)
</code></pre>
<p>or worse : </p>
<pre><code># get list of indexes of items to be removed
removeIndexes = []
for i in range(len(allItems)):
    if not allItems[i].isValid():
        removeIndexes.add(i)

# don't forget to remove items in descending order, or later indexes
# will be invalidated by earlier removals
sort(removeIndexes,reverse=True)

# copy list
validItems = allItems[:]

# now remove the items from allItems
for idx in removeIndexes:
    del validItems[i]
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Python STL ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">in</span> hope of leveraging my years of STL experience ) - Start with the collections ABC 's to learn what Python has. http : //docs.python.org/library/collections.html </p>
<p>Python linked lists. Python lists have all the features you would want from a linked list . </p>
<p>Python advanced list usage. What does this mean ? </p>
<p>Python list optimization. What does this mean ? </p>
<p>Python ordered sets. You have several choices here ; you could <span style="background-color:yellow;">invent</span> your own " ordered set " as a list that discards duplicates. You can subclass the heapq and add methods that discard duplicates : http : //docs.python.org/library/heapq.html . </p>
<p>In many cases , however , the cost of maintaing an ordered set <span style="background-color:yellow;">is</span> actually excessive because <span style="background-color:yellow;">it</span> must only be ordered once at the end of the algorithm. In other cases , the " ordered set " really <span style="background-color:yellow;">is</span> a heapq -- you never needed the set-like features and only needed the ordering . </p>
<p>Non-Trivial . ( I 'm guessing at what you meant by " non-trivial " ) . All Python objects are equivalent. There 's no " trivial " vs. " non-trivial " objects. They 're all first-class objects and can all have " non-trivial " complexity without any real work. This <span style="background-color:yellow;">is</span> not C + + where there are primitive ( non-object ) values floating around. Everything 's an object <span style="background-color:yellow;">in</span> Python . </p>
<p>Management Expectations . For the most part the C + + brain-cramping does n't exist <span style="background-color:yellow;">in</span> Python. Use the obvious Python classes the obvious way and you 'll have much less code. The reduction <span style="background-color:yellow;">in</span> code volume <span style="background-color:yellow;">is</span> the big win. Often , the management reason for converting C + + to Python <span style="background-color:yellow;">is</span> to get rid of the C + + complexity . </p>
<p>Python code will be much simpler , making <span style="background-color:yellow;">it</span> much more reliable and much easier to maintain . </p>
<p>While <span style="background-color:yellow;">it</span> 's generally true that Python <span style="background-color:yellow;">is</span> slower than C + + , <span style="background-color:yellow;">it</span> 's also true that picking the right algorithm and data structure can have dramatic <span style="background-color:yellow;">improvements</span> on performance. In one benchmark , someone found that Python was actually faster than C because the C program had such a poorly chosen data structure . </p>
<p>It 's possible that your C + + has a really poor algorithm and you will see comparable performance from Python . </p>
<p>It 's also possible that your C + + program <span style="background-color:yellow;">is</span> I/O bound , or has other limitations that will leave the Python running at a comparable speed . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>The design of Python <span style="background-color:yellow;">is</span> quite <span style="background-color:yellow;">intentionally</span> " you can use just a few data structures ( arrays and hash tables ) for whatever you want to do , and <span style="background-color:yellow;">if</span> that <span style="background-color:yellow;">is</span> n't fast enough there 's always C " . </p>
<p>Python 's standard library does n't have a sorted-list data structure like std : : set . You can download a red/black tree <span style="background-color:yellow;">implementation</span> or roll your own. ( For small data sets , just using a list and periodically sorting <span style="background-color:yellow;">it</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">is</span> a totally normal thing to do <span style="background-color:yellow;">in</span> Python. ) </p>
<p>Rolling your own linked list <span style="background-color:yellow;">is</span> very easy . </p>
