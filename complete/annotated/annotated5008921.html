<h3>Question ( ID-5008921 ) : </h3><h2>How do I reverse an <span style="background-color:yellow;">itertools.chain</span> object ? </h2><p>My function creates a chain of generators : </p>
<pre><code>def bar(num):
    import itertools
    some_sequence = (x*1.5 for x in range(num))
    some_other_sequence = (x*2.6 for x in range(num))
    chained = itertools.chain(some_sequence, some_other_sequence)
    return chained
</code></pre>
<p>My function sometimes needs to return <span style="background-color:yellow;">chained</span> in reversed order. Conceptually , the following is what I would like to be able to do : </p>
<pre><code>if num < 0:
    return reversed(chained)
return chained
</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately : </p>
<pre><code>>>> reversed(chained)
TypeError: argument to reversed() must be a sequence
</code></pre>
<p>What are my options ? </p>
<p>This is in some realtime graphic rendering code so I do n't want to make it too complicated/slow . </p>
<p>EDIT : When I first posed this question I had n't thought about the reversibility of generators. As many have pointed out , generators ca n't be reversed . </p>
<p>I do in fact want to reverse the flattened contents of the chain ; not just the order of the generators . </p>
<p>Based on the responses , there is no single call I can use to reverse an <span style="background-color:yellow;">itertools.chain</span> , so I think the only solution here is to use a <span style="background-color:yellow;">list</span> , at least for the reverse case , and perhaps for both . </p>

<p>reversed ( ) needs an actual sequence , because it <span style="background-color:yellow;">iterates</span> it backwards by index , and that would n't work for a generator ( which only has the notion of " next " item ) . </p>
<p>Since you will need to unroll the whole generator anyway for reversing , the most efficient way is to read it to a <span style="background-color:yellow;">list</span> and reverse the <span style="background-color:yellow;">list</span> in-place with the .reverse ( ) method . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>You can not reverse generators by definition. The interface of a generator is the <span style="background-color:yellow;">iterator</span> , which is a container that supports only forward <span style="background-color:yellow;">iteration.</span> When you want to reverse a <span style="background-color:yellow;">iterator</span> , you have to collect all it 's items first and reverse them after that . </p>
<p>Use <span style="background-color:yellow;">lists</span> instead or generate the sequences backwards from the start . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p><span style="background-color:yellow;">itertools.chain</span> would need to implement __reversed__ ( ) ( this would be best ) or __len__ ( ) and __getitem__ ( ) </p>
<p>Since it does n't , and there 's not even a way to access the internal sequences you 'll need to expand the entire sequence to be able to reverse it . </p>
<pre><code>reversed(list(CHAIN_INSTANCE))
</code></pre>
<p>It would be nice if chain would make __reversed__ ( ) available when all the sequences are reversable , but currently it does not do that. Perhaps you can write your own version of chain that does </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>reversed only works on objects that support len and indexing. You have to first generate all results of a generator before wrapping reversed around them . </p>
<p>However , you could easily do this : </p>
<pre><code>def bar(num):
    import itertools
    some_sequence = (x*1.5 for x in range(num, -1, -1))
    some_other_sequence = (x*2.6 for x in range(num, -1, -1))
    chained = itertools.chain(some_other_sequence, some_sequence)
    return chained
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Does this work in you real app ? </p>
<pre><code>def bar(num):
    import itertools
    some_sequence = (x*1.5 for x in range(num))
    some_other_sequence = (x*2.6 for x in range(num))
    list_of_chains = [some_sequence, some_other_sequence]
    if num < 0:
        list_of_chains.reverse()
    chained = itertools.chain(*list_of_chains)
    return chained
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>In theory you ca n't because <span style="background-color:yellow;">chained</span> objects may even contain infinite sequences such as <span style="background-color:yellow;">itertools.count</span> ( ... ) . </p>
<p>You should try to reverse your generators/sequences or use reversed ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">iterable</span> ) for each sequence if applicable and then chain them together last-to-first. Of course this highly depends on your use case . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><pre><code>def reversed2(iter):
    return reversed(list(iter))
</code></pre>
