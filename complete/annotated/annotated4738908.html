<h3>Question ( ID-4738908 ) : </h3><h2>Python : Generalizing solution </h2><p>I 'm currently using singpath.com to practice on my python , but I face an issue with a problem : </p>
<p>A number , a , is a power of b if it is divisible by b and a/b is a power of b . Write a function called <span style="background-color:yellow;">is_power</span> that takes parameters a and b and returns True if a is a power of b . </p>
<pre><code>def is_power(a,b):
    c = a/b
    if (((a%b) == 0) and ((c%b) == 0)):
        return True
    else:
        return False 
</code></pre>
<p>Above is my solution but the system prompt me to generalize my solution . Can anyone tell me whats wrong with my solution ? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-8 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>The reason reason why your original code does not work is the following : You just check ( c % b ) = = 0 ) aka ( a/b ) is divisible by b , which is much weaker than the a/b is a power of b part of the definition . </p>
<p>When you want to solve a problem such as this you should always start with the trivial cases. In this case there are two such cases : <span style="background-color:yellow;">is_power</span> ( x,x ) and <span style="background-color:yellow;">is_power</span> ( 1,x ) - in both the answer is True , because x * * 1 = = x and x * * 0 = = 1 . </p>
<p>Once you have these cases covered you just need to write down the rest of the definition. Write code for ( a is divisible by b ) and ( a/b is a power of b ) and put it all together . </p>
<p>The final function will look like this : </p>
<pre><code>def is_power(a,b):
    if <trivial case 1> or <trivial case 2>:
        return True
    # its a recursive definition so you have to use `is_power` here
    return <a is divisible by b> and <a/b is a power of b>
</code></pre>
<p>The only question left is how to answer &lt ; a/b is a power of b&gt ; . The easiest way to do this is using the function <span style="background-color:yellow;">is_power</span> itself - this is called recursion . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>You are only checking the first two powers : a divides b and a/b divides b. It could be that a = b * * 3 or b * * 4 ( or b * * n in general ) , so the actual solution will have to involve recursion or a loop . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>I would n't say to generalize it. I would say to correct it as it 's incorrect. Using your solution <span style="background-color:yellow;">is_power</span> ( 12,2 ) returns True as does <span style="background-color:yellow;">is_power</span> ( 18,3 ) . </p>
<p>I think that the reason that the system says to generalize it is that it 's probably working correctly for some of their test cases , but not others. It 's likely that the test cases for which it is working are coincidentally those for which it would work if it were hard-coded in a certain way ( only checking powers of 2 , for example ) . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>You 're checking whether a/b is divisible by b ( in the expression ( c % b ) = = 0 ) , rather than whether a/b is a power of b . Hint : What function would you call to see whether something is a power of b ? </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>To understand recursion , you need first to understand recursion . </p>
<pre><code> def is_power(a, b):
     if a < b: # 3 is never a power of 10, right?
         return False # prevent recursion
     if a == b:  # a is always a**1, right?
         return True  # prevent recursion
     else:
         return is_power(a / b, b) # recursion!
</code></pre>
<p>Note that for integers a / b will give you rounding errors. Make sure you pass <span style="background-color:yellow;">floats</span> . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>I do n't think you have the right implementation. Based on the problem , the <span style="background-color:yellow;">is_power</span> function should look something like this : </p>
<pre><code>def is_power(a,b):
    if a%b == 0 and is_power(float(a)/float(b), b):
        return True
    else:
        return False
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>You can cheat and use log . </p>
<pre><code>import math

def is_power(a, b):
    return math.log(a, b) % 1 == 0
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>def <span style="background-color:yellow;">is_power</span> ( a,b ) : if ( a = = b ) : return True if ( a % b = = 0 ) : if <span style="background-color:yellow;">is_power</span> ( a/b,b ) : return True else : return False else : return False </p>
