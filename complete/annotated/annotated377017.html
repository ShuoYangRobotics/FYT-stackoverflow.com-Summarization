<h3>Question ( ID-377017 ) : </h3><h2>Test if executable exists in Python ? </h2><p>In python , is there a portable and simple way to test if an executable <span style="background-color:yellow;">program</span> exists ? </p>
<p>By simple I mean something like the ' <span style="background-color:yellow;">which</span> ' command <span style="background-color:yellow;">which</span> would be just perfect. I do n't want to search PATH manually or something involving trying to execute it with Popen &amp ; al and see if it fails ( that 's what I 'm doing now , but imagine it 's launchmissiles ) </p>
<p>EDIT : The answer is ' No ' , from the different posts , I just have to search path manually ans use Jay 's answer ( sorry for the bad formulation about 'which ' <span style="background-color:yellow;">which</span> I understand , but I thought maybe there 's something in <span style="background-color:yellow;">os.path</span> that does that though named strangely ) . </p>

<pre><code>def which(program):
    import os
    def is_exe(fpath):
        return os.path.exists(fpath) and os.access(fpath, os.X_OK)

    fpath, fname = os.path.split(program)
    if fpath:
        if is_exe(program):
            return program
    else:
        for path in os.environ["PATH"].split(os.pathsep):
            exe_file = os.path.join(path, program)
            if is_exe(exe_file):
                return exe_file

    return None

<p>Edit : Updated code sample to include logic for handling case where provided argument is already a full path to the executable , i.e. " <span style="background-color:yellow;">which</span> /bin/ls " . This mimics the behavior of the UNIX 'which ' command . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>See <span style="background-color:yellow;">os.path</span> module for some useful functions on pathnames. To check if an existing file is executable , use <span style="background-color:yellow;">os.access</span> ( path , mode ) , with the <span style="background-color:yellow;">os.X_OK</span> mode . </p>
<blockquote><span style="background-color:yellow;">os.X_OK</span> Value to include in the mode parameter of access ( ) to determine if path can be executed . </blockquote>
<p>EDIT : The suggested <span style="background-color:yellow;">which</span> ( ) implementations are missing one clue - using <span style="background-color:yellow;">os.path.join</span> ( ) to build full file names . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>Just remember to specify the file extension on windows. Otherwise , you have to write a much complicated <span style="background-color:yellow;">is_exe</span> for windows using PATHEXT environment variable. You may just want to use FindPath . </p>
<p>OTOH , why are you even bothering to search for the executable ? The operating system will do it for you as part of popen call &amp ; will raise an exception if the executable is not found. All you need to do is catch the correct exception for given OS. Note that on Windows , subprocess.Popen ( exe , shell = True ) will fail silently if exe is not found . </p>
<hr />
<p>Incorporating PATHEXT into the above implementation of <span style="background-color:yellow;">which</span> ( in Jay 's answer ) : </p>
<pre><code>def which(program):
    def is_exe(fpath):
        return os.path.exists(fpath) and os.access(fpath, os.X_OK)

    def ext_candidates(fpath):
        yield fpath
        for ext in os.environ.get("PATHEXT", "").split(os.pathsep):
            yield fpath + ext

    fpath, fname = os.path.split(program)
    if fpath:
        if is_exe(program):
            return program
    else:
        for path in os.environ["PATH"].split(os.pathsep):
            exe_file = os.path.join(path, program)
            for candidate in ext_candidates(exe_file):
                if is_exe(candidate):
                    return candidate

    return None

<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>None of previous examples do work on all platforms. Usually they fail to work on Windows because you can execute without the file extension and that you can register new extension. For example on Windows if python is well installed it 's enough to execute 'file.py ' and it will work . </p>
<p>The only valid and portable solution I had was to execute the command and see error code. Any decent executable should have a set of calling parameters that will do nothing . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>you can tell if a file exists with the <span style="background-color:yellow;">os</span> module. an executable in particular seems quite unportable considering lots of things are executable on nix that are n't on windows and vice versa . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>It would seem the obvious choice is " <span style="background-color:yellow;">which</span> " , parsing the results via popen , but you could simulate it otherwise using the <span style="background-color:yellow;">os</span> class. In pseudopython , it would look like this : </p>
<pre><code>for each element r in path:
    for each file f in directory p:
        if f is executable:
           return True
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>So basically you want to find a file in mounted filesystem ( not necessarily in PATH directories only ) and check if it is executable. This translates to following plan : </p>
<ul>enumerate all files in locally mounted filesystems match results with name pattern for each file found check if it is executable </ul>
<p>I 'd say , doing this in a portable way will require lots of computing power and time. Is it really what you need ? </p>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>There is a <span style="background-color:yellow;">which.py</span> script in a standard Python distribution ( e.g. on Windows ' \ PythonXX \ Tools \ Scripts \ <span style="background-color:yellow;">which.py</span> ' ) . </p>
<p>EDIT : <span style="background-color:yellow;">which.py</span> depends on ls therefore it is not cross-platform . </p>
<br /><b># 8 </b><br /><p>If you have bash and a function sh ( subprocess.Popen ( ... ) .communicate ( ) ) , use the bash builtin type : </p>
<pre><code>type -p ls  =>  /bin/ls
type -p nonesuch  =>  ""
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 9 </b><br /><p>An important question is " Why do you need to test if executable exist ? " Maybe you do n't ? ; - ) </p>
<p>Recently I needed this functionality to launch viewer for PNG file. I wanted to iterate over some predefined viewers and run the first that exists. Fortunately , I came across <span style="background-color:yellow;">os.startfile</span> . It 's much better ! Simple , portable and uses the default viewer on the system : </p>
<pre><code>>>> os.startfile('yourfile.png')
</code></pre>
<p>Update : I was wrong about <span style="background-color:yellow;">os.startfile</span> being portable... It 's Windows only. On Mac you have to run open command. And xdg_open on Unix. There 's a Python issue on adding Mac and Unix support for <span style="background-color:yellow;">os.startfile</span> . </p>
<br /><b># 10 </b><br /><p>I found something in StackOverflow that solved the problem for me. This works provided the executable has an option ( like --help or --version ) that outputs something and returns an exit status of zero. See Suppress output in Python calls to executables - the " result " at the end of the code snippet in this answer will be zero if the executable is in path , else it is most likely to be 1 . </p>
