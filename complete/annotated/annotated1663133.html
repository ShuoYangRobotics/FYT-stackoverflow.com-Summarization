<h3>Question ( ID-1663133 ) : </h3><h2>Using Python to check <span style="background-color:yellow;">words</span> </h2><p>I 'm stuck on a simple problem. I 've got a dictionary of <span style="background-color:yellow;">words</span> in the English language , and a sample text that is to be checked. I 've got to check every <span style="background-color:yellow;">word</span> in the sample against the dictionary , and the code I 'm using is wrong . </p>
<pre><code>for word in checkList:      # iterates through every word in the sample
    if word not in refDict: # checks if word is not in the dictionary
         print word         # just to see if it's recognizing misspelled words
</code></pre>
<p>The only problem is , as it goes through the loop it prints out every <span style="background-color:yellow;">word</span> , not just the misspelled ones. Can someone explain this and offer a solution possibly ? Thank you so much ! </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-6 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>The snippet you have is functional. See for example </p>
<pre><code>>>> refDict = {'alpha':1, 'bravo':2, 'charlie':3, 'delta':4}
>>> s = 'he said bravo to charlie O\'Brian and jack Alpha'
>>> for word in s.split():
...   if word not in refDict:
...       print(repr(word))  # by temporarily using repr() we can see exactly
...                          #  what the words are like
...
'he'
'said'
'to'
"O'Brian"
'and'
'jack'
'Alpha'     # note how Alpha was not found in refDict (u/l case difference)
</code></pre>
<p>Therefore , the dictionary contents must differ from what you think , or the <span style="background-color:yellow;">words</span> out of checklist are not exactly as they appear ( eg. with whitespace or capitalization ; see the use of <span style="background-color:yellow;">repr</span> ( ) ( * ) in print statement to help identify cases of the former ) . </p>
<p>Debugging suggestion : FOCUS on the first <span style="background-color:yellow;">word</span> from checklist ( or the first that you suspect is to be found in dictionary ) . Then for this <span style="background-color:yellow;">word</span> and this <span style="background-color:yellow;">word</span> only , print it in details , with its length , with bracket on either side etc. , for both the <span style="background-color:yellow;">word</span> out of checklist and the corresponding key in the dictionary.. . </p>
<p>( * ) <span style="background-color:yellow;">repr</span> ( ) was a suggestion from John Machin. Instead I often use brackets or other characters as in print ( ' [ ' + <span style="background-color:yellow;">word</span> + ' ] ' ) , but <span style="background-color:yellow;">repr</span> ( ) is more exacting in its output . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>Consider <span style="background-color:yellow;">stripping</span> your <span style="background-color:yellow;">words</span> of any whitespace that might be there , and changing all the <span style="background-color:yellow;">words</span> of both sets to the same case. Like this : </p>
<pre><code>word.strip().lower()
</code></pre>
<p>That way you can make sure you 're comparing apples to apples . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>Clearly " <span style="background-color:yellow;">word</span> not in refDict " always evaluates to True. This is probably because the contents of refDict or checkList are not what you think they are. Are they both tuples or lists of strings ? </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>The code you have would work if the keys in refDict are the correctly spelt <span style="background-color:yellow;">words.</span> If the correctly spelt <span style="background-color:yellow;">words</span> are the values in your dict then you need something like this : </p>
<pre><code>for word in checkList:
    if word not in refDict.values():
        print word
</code></pre>
<p>Is there a reason you dictionary is stored as a mapping as opposed to a list or a set ? A python dict contains name-value pairs for example I could use this mapping : { " dog " : 23 , " cat " : 45 , " pony " : 67 } to store an index of a <span style="background-color:yellow;">word</span> and page number it is found in some book. In your case your dict is a mapping of what to what ? </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Are the <span style="background-color:yellow;">words</span> in the refDict the keys or the values ? </p>
<p>Your code will only see keys : e.g. : </p>
<pre><code>refDict = { 'w':'x', 'y':'z' }
for word in [ 'w','x','y','z' ]:
  if word not in refDict:
  print word
</code></pre>
<p>prints : </p>
<pre><code>x
z
</code></pre>
<p>Othewise you want ; </p>
<p>if <span style="background-color:yellow;">word</span> not in refDict.values ( ) </p>
<p>Of course this rather assumes that your dictionary is an actual python dictionary which seems an odd way to store a list of <span style="background-color:yellow;">words</span> . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>Your refDict is probably wrong. The in keyword checks if the value is in the keys of the dictionary. I believe you 've put your <span style="background-color:yellow;">words</span> in as values . </p>
<p>I 'd propose using a set instead of a dictionary . </p>
<pre><code>knownwords = set("dog", "cat")
knownwords.add("apple")

text = "The dog eats an apple."
for word in text.split(" "):
    # to ignore case word is converted to lowercase
    if word.lower() not in knownwords:
        print word
# The
# eats
# an
# apple.       <- doesn't work because of the dot
</code></pre>
