<h3>Question ( ID-7896935 ) : </h3><h2>Independent function or method </h2><p>I need to deal with a two objects of a class in a way that will return a third object of the same class , and I am trying to determine whether it is <span style="background-color:yellow;">better</span> to do this as an independent function that receives two objects and returns the third or as a method which would take one other object and return the third . </p>
<hr />
<p>For a simple example. Would this : </p>
<pre><code>from collections import namedtuple

class Point(namedtuple('Point', 'x y')):
    __slots__ = ()
    #Attached to class
    def midpoint(self, otherpoint):
        mx = (self.x + otherpoint.x) / 2.0
        my = (self.y + otherpoint.y) / 2.0
        return Point(mx, my)

a = Point(1.0, 2.0)
b = Point(2.0, 3.0)

print a.midpoint(b)
#Point(x=1.5, y=2.5)
</code></pre>
<p>Or this : </p>
<pre><code>from collections import namedtuple

class Point(namedtuple('Point', 'x y')):
    __slots__ = ()


#not attached to class
#takes two point objects
def midpoint(p1, p2):
    mx = (p1.x + p2.x) / 2.0
    my = (p1.y + p2.y) / 2.0
    return Point(mx, my)


a = Point(1.0, 2.0)
b = Point(2.0, 3.0)

print midpoint(a, b)
#Point(x=1.5, y=2.5)
</code></pre>
<p>and why would one <span style="background-color:yellow;">be</span> preferred over the other ? </p>
<hr />
<p>This seems far less clear cut than I had expected when I asked the question . </p>
<p>In summary , it seems that something like a.midpoint ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">b</span> ) is not preferred since it seems to give a special place to one point or another in what is really a symmetric function that returns a completely new point instance. But it seems to <span style="background-color:yellow;">be</span> largely a matter of taste and style <span style="background-color:yellow;">between</span> something like a freestanding module function or a function attached to the class , <span style="background-color:yellow;">but</span> not meant to <span style="background-color:yellow;">be</span> called <span style="background-color:yellow;">by</span> the insance , such as <span style="background-color:yellow;">Point.midpoint</span> ( a , <span style="background-color:yellow;">b</span> ) . </p>
<p>I think , personally , I stylistically lean towards free-standing module functions , <span style="background-color:yellow;">but</span> it may depend on the circumstances. In cases where the function is definitely tightly <span style="background-color:yellow;">bound</span> to the class and there is any risk of namespace pollution or potential confusion , then making a class function probably makes more sense . </p>
<p>Also , a couple of people mentioned making the function more general , perhaps <span style="background-color:yellow;">by</span> implementing additional features of the class to support this. In this particular case dealing with points and <span style="background-color:yellow;">midpoints</span> , that is probably the overall <span style="background-color:yellow;">best</span> approach. It supports polymorphism and code reuse and is highly readable. In a lot of cases though , that would not work ( the project that inspired me to ask this for instance ) , <span style="background-color:yellow;">but</span> points and <span style="background-color:yellow;">midpoints</span> seemed like a concise and understandable example to illustrate the question . </p>
<p>Thank you all , it was enlightening . </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-6 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>The first approach is reasonable and is n't conceptually different from what set.union and set.intersection do. Any func ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">Point</span> , <span style="background-color:yellow;">Point</span> ) --&gt ; <span style="background-color:yellow;">Point</span> is clearly related to the <span style="background-color:yellow;">Point</span> class , so there is no question about interfering with the unity or cohesion of the class . </p>
<p>It would <span style="background-color:yellow;">be</span> a tougher choice if different classes were involved : draw_perpendicular ( line , point ) --&gt ; line . To resolve the choice of classes , you would pick the one that has the most related logic. For example , str.join needs a string delimiter and a list of strings. It could have <span style="background-color:yellow;">been</span> a standalone function ( as it was in the old days with the string module ) , or it could <span style="background-color:yellow;">be</span> a method on lists ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">but</span> it only works for lists of strings ) , or a method on strings. The latter was chosen <span style="background-color:yellow;">because</span> joining is more about strings than it is about lists. This choice was made eventhough it led to the arguably awkward expression delimiter.join ( things_to_join ) . </p>
<p>I disagree with the other respondent who recommended using a classmethod. Those are often used for alternate constructor signatures <span style="background-color:yellow;">but</span> not for transformations on instances of the class. For example , datetime.fromordinal is a classmethod for constructing a date from something other than an instance of the class ( in this case , an from an int ) . This contrasts with datetime.replace which is a regular method for making a new datetime instance <span style="background-color:yellow;">based</span> on an existing instance. This should steer you away from using classmethod for the <span style="background-color:yellow;">midpoint</span> computation . </p>
<p>One other thought : if you keep <span style="background-color:yellow;">midpoint</span> ( ) with the <span style="background-color:yellow;">Point</span> ( ) class , it makes it possible to create other classes that have the same <span style="background-color:yellow;">Point</span> API <span style="background-color:yellow;">but</span> a different internal representation ( i.e. polar coordinates may <span style="background-color:yellow;">be</span> more convenient for some types of work than Cartesian coordinates ) . If <span style="background-color:yellow;">midpoint</span> ( ) is a separate function you start to lose the <span style="background-color:yellow;">benefits</span> of encapsulation and of a coherent interface . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>I would choose the second option <span style="background-color:yellow;">because</span> , in my opinion , it is clearer than the first. You are performing the <span style="background-color:yellow;">midpoint</span> operation <span style="background-color:yellow;">between</span> two points ; not the <span style="background-color:yellow;">midpoint</span> operation with respect to a point. Similarly , a natural extension of this interface could <span style="background-color:yellow;">be</span> to define dot , cross , magnitude , average , median , etc. Some of those functions will operate on pairs of <span style="background-color:yellow;">Points</span> and others may operate on lists. Making it a function makes them all have consistent interfaces . </p>
<p>Defining it as a function also allows it to <span style="background-color:yellow;">be</span> used with any pair of objects that present a .x .y interface , while making it a method requires that at least one of the two is a <span style="background-color:yellow;">Point</span> . </p>
<p>Lastly , to address the location of the function , I <span style="background-color:yellow;">believe</span> it makes sense to co-locate it in the same package as the <span style="background-color:yellow;">Point</span> class. This places it in the same namespace , which clearly indicates its relationship with <span style="background-color:yellow;">Point</span> and , in my opinion , is more pythonic than a static or class method . </p>
<p>Update : Further reading on the Pythonicness of @ staticmethod vs package/module : </p>
<p>In <span style="background-color:yellow;">both</span> Thomas Wouter 's answer to the question What is the difference <span style="background-color:yellow;">between</span> staticmethod and classmethod in Python and Mike Steder 's answer to init and arguments in Python , the authors indicated that a package or module of related functions is perhaps a <span style="background-color:yellow;">better</span> solution. Thomas Wouter has this to say : </p>
<blockquote>[ staticmethod ] is <span style="background-color:yellow;">basically</span> useless in Python -- you can just use a module function instead of a staticmethod . </blockquote>
<p>While Mike Steder comments : </p>
<blockquote>If you find yourself creating objects that consist of nothing <span style="background-color:yellow;">but</span> staticmethods the more pythonic thing to do would <span style="background-color:yellow;">be</span> to create a new module of related functions . </blockquote>
<p>However , codeape rightly points out <span style="background-color:yellow;">below</span> that a calling convention of <span style="background-color:yellow;">Point.midpoint</span> ( a,b ) will co-locate the functionality with the type. The BDFL also seems to value @ staticmethod as the __new__ method is a staticmethod . </p>
<p>My personal preference would <span style="background-color:yellow;">be</span> to use a function for the reasons cited above , <span style="background-color:yellow;">but</span> it appears that the choice <span style="background-color:yellow;">between</span> @ staticmethod and a stand-alone function are largely in the eye of the <span style="background-color:yellow;">beholder</span> . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>In this case you can use operator overloading : </p>
<pre><code>from collections import namedtuple

class Point(namedtuple('Point', 'x y')):
    __slots__ = ()
    #Attached to class
    def __add__(self, otherpoint):
        mx = (self.x + otherpoint.x)
        my = (self.y + otherpoint.y)
        return Point(mx, my)

    def __div__(self, scalar):
        return Point(self.x/scalar, self.y/scalar)


a = Point(1.0, 2.0)
b = Point(2.0, 3.0)

def mid(a,b): # general function
    return (a+b)/2

print mid(a,b)
</code></pre>
<p>I think the decision mostly depends on how general and abstract the function is. If you can write the function in a way that works on all objects that implement a small set of clean interfaces , then you can turn it into a separate function. The more interfaces your function depends on and the more specific they are , the more it makes sense to put it on the class ( as instances of this class will most likely <span style="background-color:yellow;">be</span> the only objects the function will work with anyways ) . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>I would choose version one , <span style="background-color:yellow;">because</span> this way all functionality for points is stored in the point class , i.e. grouping related functionality. Additionally , point objects know <span style="background-color:yellow;">best</span> about the meaning and inner workings of their data , so it 's the right place to implement your function. An external function , for example in C + + , would have to <span style="background-color:yellow;">be</span> a friend , which smells like a hack . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Another option is to use a @ classmethod . It is probably what I would prefer in this case . </p>
<pre><code>class Point(...):
    @classmethod
    def midpoint(cls, p1, p2):
        mx = (p1.x + p2.x) / 2.0
        my = (p1.y + p2.y) / 2.0
        return cls(mx, my)

# ...
print Point.midpoint(a, b)
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>A different way of doing this is to access x and y through the <span style="background-color:yellow;">namedtuple</span> 's subscript interface. You can then completely generalize the <span style="background-color:yellow;">midpoint</span> function to n dimensions . </p>
<pre><code>class Point(namedtuple('Point', 'x y')):
    __slots__ = ()

def midpoint(left, right):
    return tuple([sum(a)/2. for a in zip(left, right)])
</code></pre>
<p>This design works for <span style="background-color:yellow;">Point</span> classes , n -tuples , lists of length n , etc. For example : </p>
<pre><code>>>> midpoint(Point(0,0), Point(1,1))
(0.5, 0.5)
>>> midpoint(Point(5,1), (3, 2))
(4.0, 1.5)
>>> midpoint((1,2,3), (4,5,6))
(2.5, 3.5, 4.5)
</code></pre>
