<h3>Question ( ID-2264889 ) : </h3><h2>What statically typed languages are similar to Python ? </h2><p>Python is the nicest language I currently know of , but static typing is a big advantage due to auto-completion ( although there is limited support for dynamic languages , it is nothing compared to that supported in static ) . I 'm curious if there are any languages which try to <span style="background-color:yellow;">add</span> the benefits of Python to a statically typed language. In particular I 'm interesting in languages with features like : </p>
<ul>Syntax support : such as that for dictionaries , array comprehensions Functions : Keyword arguments , closures , tuple/multiple return values Runtime modification/creation of classes Avoidance of specifying classes everywhere ( in Python this is due to duck typing , although type inference would work better in a statically typed language ) Metaprogramming support : <span style="background-color:yellow;">This</span> is achieved in Python through reflection , annotations and metaclasses </ul>
<p>Are there any statically typed languages with a significant number of these features ? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">Total-9</span> ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>Boo is a statically typed language for the Common Language Infrastructure ( aka. the Microsoft .NET platform ) . <span style="background-color:yellow;">The</span> syntax is highly inspired by Python , and hashes/lists/array are part of the syntax : </p>
<pre><code>i = 5
if i > 5:
    print "i is greater than 5."
else:
    print "i is less than or equal to 5."

hash = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'monkey': 3, 42: 'the answer'}
print hash['a']
print hash[42]

for item in hash:
    print item.Key, '=>', item.Value

<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>It may not match all your needs , but have a look at Boo - <span style="background-color:yellow;">The</span> wristfriendly language for the CLI </p>
<p>If you do , I highly recommend DSLs in Boo : Domain-Specific Languages in .NET which apart from the DSL aspects , covers Boo syntax in a very nice appendix and a lot of meta-programming . </p>
<p>Furthermore the tutorials are a great resource . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>Cobra is a statically typed language for the CLR ( as Boo ) . From its web page : </p>
<blockquote>Cobra is a general purpose programming language with : - a clean , high-level syntax - static and dynamic binding - first class support for unit tests and contracts - compiled performance with scripting conveniences - lambdas and closures - extensions and mixins - ...and more </blockquote>

<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>Although it is not object-oriented , Haskell offers a significant number of the features that interest you : </p>
<ul>Syntax support for list comprehensions , plus do notation for a wide variety of sequencing/binding constructs. ( Syntax support for dictionaries is limited to lists of pairs , e.g , dict = ofElements [ ( " Sputnik " , 1957 ) , ( " Apollo " , 1969 ) , ( " Challenger " , 1988 ) ] Functions support full closures and multiple return values using tuple types. Keyword arguments are not supported but a powerful feature of " implicit arguments " can sometimes substitute . No runtime modification of classes , types or objects . Avoidance of specificying classes/types everywhere through type inference . Metaprogramming using <span style="background-color:yellow;">Template</span> Haskell . </ul>
<p>Also , just so you will feel at home , Haskell has significant indentation ! </p>
<p>I actually think Haskell has quite a different feel from Python overall , but that is primarily because of the extremely powerful static type system. If you are interested in trying a statically typed language , Haskell is one of the most ambitious ones out there right now . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>try the Go programming language ? I 've seen some similar paradigm . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>If auto-completion is the thing you are looking for , then you might wan na stick with Python and use a great IDE instead . </p>
<p><span style="background-color:yellow;">Try</span> PyCharm : http : //www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/index.html </p>
<p>Unless you are coding some extremely dynamic stuff ( which you ca n't probably do in a static language anyway ) , it will keep up with the code and give you completion , refactoring and all the other goodies we are used to in statically typed languages . </p>
<p>You can give typehints to the IDE where you really need it by doing : </p>
<pre><code>def foo(bar):
    if 0: bar = Bar() # "if 0" will be removed from the bytecode automatically by python
    bar. # will now autocomplete
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p><span style="background-color:yellow;">The</span> D programming language is a statically typed , natively compiled language that has some significant features inspired by Python . </p>
<p>Arrays and associative arrays are built into the language. <span style="background-color:yellow;">There</span> are no list comprehensions , but the std.range and std.algorithm libraries fill much of that void. For example , here 's a way to sum up all the even numbers from 0 to 100 in D : </p>
<pre><code>auto result = reduce!"a + b"(
    filter!"a % 2 == 0"(
        iota(0, 100)
    )
);
</code></pre>
<p><span style="background-color:yellow;">There</span> are no keyword arguments so far , but closures are there. <span style="background-color:yellow;">Tuples</span> are supported , but not unpacked automatically . </p>
<p>In D , you avoid specifying classes ( and types in general ) everywhere with the auto keyword and with templates. For example , here is generic code to find the product of array of any numeric type : </p>
<pre><code>// The return type of product() is inferred.
auto product(T)(T[] array) {
    T ret = 1;
    foreach(num; array) { // typeof(num) is inferred.
        ret *= num;
    }

    return ret;
}
</code></pre>
<p>D 's metaprogramming support consists of compile time introspection ( for example , you can iterate over the fields of a class or struct at compile time ) , runtime type information , and templates that are actually designed for metaprogramming beyond simple generics. For example , here 's how to write a generic function that generates a default comparison operation for two structs , which is useful if you need an arbitrary total ordering for something like a binary tree : </p>
<pre><code>/**Returns -1 if lhs < rhs, 0 if lhs == rhs, 1 if lhs > rhs.*/
int compareStructs(T)(T lhs, T rhs) {
    foreach(tupleIndex, value; lhs.tupleof) {
        if(value < rhs.tupeof[tupleIndex]) {
            return -1;
        } else if(value > rhs.tupleof[tupleIndex]) {
            return 1;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}

<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>Autocompletion is still possible in a dynamically typed language ; nothing prevents the IDE from doing type inference or inspection , even if the language implementation does n't . </p>
<br /><b># 8 </b><br /><p>I think Eric and PyScripter have nice autocompletion on Windows , but maybe not as good as PyTools for Visual Studio ( Express ) . </p>
<p>For static typing in Python , i 'd use Cython : http : //docs.cython.org/src/quickstart/cythonize.html </p>
