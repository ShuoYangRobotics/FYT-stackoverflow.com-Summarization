<h3>Question ( ID-245792 ) : </h3><h2>When is not a good <span style="background-color:yellow;">time</span> to use python generators ? </h2><p>This is rather the inverse of What can you use Python generator <span style="background-color:yellow;">functions</span> for ? : python generators , generator expressions , and the itertools module are some of my favorite features of python these days. They 're especially useful when setting up chains of operations to perform on a big pile of data--I often use them when processing DSV files . </p>
<p>So when is it not a good <span style="background-color:yellow;">time</span> to use a generator , or a generator expression , or an itertools <span style="background-color:yellow;">function</span> ? </p>
<ul>When should I prefer zip ( ) over itertools.izip ( ) , or <span style="background-color:yellow;">range</span> ( ) over <span style="background-color:yellow;">xrange</span> ( ) , or [ <span style="background-color:yellow;">x</span> for <span style="background-color:yellow;">x</span> in foo ] over ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">x</span> for <span style="background-color:yellow;">x</span> in foo ) ? </ul>
<p>Obviously , we eventually need to " resolve " a generator into actual data , usually by creating a list or iterating over it with a non-generator loop. Sometimes we just need to know the length. This is n't what I 'm asking . </p>
<p>We use generators so that we 're not assigning new lists into memory for interim data. This especially makes sense for large datasets. Does it make sense for small datasets too ? Is there a noticeable memory/cpu trade-off ? </p>
<p>I 'm especially interested if anyone has done some profiling on this , in light of the eye-opening discussion of list comprehension performance vs. map ( ) and filter ( ) . </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-8 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>You should never favor zip over izip , <span style="background-color:yellow;">range</span> over <span style="background-color:yellow;">xrange</span> , or list comprehensions over generator comprehensions. In Python 3.0 <span style="background-color:yellow;">range</span> has <span style="background-color:yellow;">xrange-like</span> semantics and zip has izip-like semantics . </p>
<p>List comprehensions are actually clearer like list ( frob ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">x</span> ) for <span style="background-color:yellow;">x</span> in foo ) for those <span style="background-color:yellow;">times</span> you need an actual list . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>In general , do n't use a generator when you need list operations , like len ( ) , reversed ( ) , and so on . </p>
<p>There may also be <span style="background-color:yellow;">times</span> when you do n't want lazy evaluation ( e.g. to do all the calculation up front so you can release a resource ) . In that case , a list expression might be better . </p>

<p>Profiling your code is the only way to know if what you 're doing has any effect at all . </p>
<p>Most usages of <span style="background-color:yellow;">xrange</span> , generators , etc are over static size , small datasets. It 's only when you get to large datasets that it really makes a difference. <span style="background-color:yellow;">range</span> ( ) vs. <span style="background-color:yellow;">xrange</span> ( ) is mostly just a matter of making the code look a tiny little bit more ugly , and not losing anything , and maybe gaining something . </p>

<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>As far as performance is concerned , I ca n't think of any <span style="background-color:yellow;">times</span> that you would want to use a list over a generator . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Regarding performance : if using <span style="background-color:yellow;">psyco</span> , lists can be quite a bit faster than generators. In the example below , lists are almost 50 % faster when using <span style="background-color:yellow;">psyco.full</span> ( ) </p>

<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>As you mention , " This especially makes sense for large datasets " , I think this answers your question . </p>
<p>If your not hitting any walls , performance-wise , I would stick to lists and standard <span style="background-color:yellow;">functions.</span> Then when you run into problems with performance make the switch . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>I 've never found a situation where generators would hinder what you 're trying to do. There are , however , plenty of instances where using generators would not help you any more than not using them . </p>
<p>For example : </p>
<pre><code>sorted(xrange(5))
</code></pre>
<p>Does not offer any improvement over : </p>
<pre><code>sorted(range(5))
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>You should prefer list comprehensions if you need to keep the values around for something else later and the size of your set is not too large . </p>
<p>For example : you are creating a list that you will loop over several <span style="background-color:yellow;">times</span> later in your program . </p>
<p>To some extent you can think of generators as a replacement for iteration ( loops ) vs. list comprehensions as a type of data structure initialization. If you want to keep the data structure then use list comprehensions . </p>
