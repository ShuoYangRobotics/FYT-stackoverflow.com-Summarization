<h3>Question ( ID-3305287 ) : </h3><h2>Python -- How do you view output that does n't fit the screen ? </h2><p>I should say I 'm looking for a solution to the problem of viewing output that does not fit on your screen. For example , range ( 100 ) will show the last 30ish <span style="background-color:yellow;">lines</span> in your terminal of 30 height . </p>
<p>I am only looking to be nudged in the right direction and am curious how you guys have approached this problem . </p>
<p>What have you done when you run into a situation where you wish you could conveniently scroll through some large output ? </p>
<h2>Best Answer </h2>
<p>Use the scrollback buffer on your terminal . </p>
<p>If you 're using GNU Screen , it can be set with defscrollback <span style="background-color:yellow;">1000</span> or any <span style="background-color:yellow;">other</span> number in HOME/.screenrc . </p>
<p>Use Ctrl-a , [ to enter copy mode </p>
<pre><code>j -    Move the cursor down by one line
k -    Move the cursor up by one line
C-u -  Scrolls a half page up.
C-b -  Scrolls a full page up.
C-d -  Scrolls a half page down.
C-f -  Scrolls the full page down.
G -    Moves to the specified line

<p>The best part is ? for reverse search , / for forward search while in copy mode . </p>
<p>Super convenient . </p>
<p>Thank you ! </p>

<h2>Original question : </h2>
<p>What is the python equivalent of the bash <span style="background-color:yellow;">less</span> command ? </p>
<pre><code>LongString | less 
</code></pre>
<p>Is there something like that for python ? I find myself thinking I could use it fairly often but just move on and find some <span style="background-color:yellow;">other</span> solution . </p>
<p>By " long things " I mean anything that generates more output <span style="background-color:yellow;">lines</span> than my screen. <span style="background-color:yellow;">1000</span> print messages , a dictionary , a large string , range ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">1000</span> ) , etc . </p>
<p>My googlefu has failed . </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-8 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>Yes , there is a way and it is quite trivial , that 's why not specifically described. Say you have long list and want to see just the beginning : </p>

<p>The same [ ] slicing works the same for strings. For dictionary you can cheat somehow , like using str ( ) to convert it to string and then display with the same slicing : - ) </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>If you want to do this for an interactive python session , you should use a terminal emulation that allows you to scroll back up. I believe most of them do . </p>
<p>If you 're using an actual terminal , or if you do n't have a choice of terminal emulators , perhaps you can use GNU screen . </p>
<p>( If you 're using Windows , you can change the screen buffer size to allow scrolling back up to 9999 <span style="background-color:yellow;">lines</span> ) . </p>
<p>And if you need this for the output of your program , you can try to use the curses module to implement scrolling yourself . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>If you work in ipython you can issue shell commands within your interactive python session. That means that you just do </p>
<pre><code>In [1]: less myfile.txt
</code></pre>
<p>I also really like being able to arrow up and down to get previous commands and getting the output from previous commands by doing something like </p>
<pre><code>In [33]: print cos(Out[7]*pi/180)
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>if your data is json serilizable then you can try </p>
<pre><code>import simplejson
print simplejson.dumps({'shipping-line': {'price': '0.00', 'code': 'Local Pickup (Portland, OR)', 'title': 'Local Pickup (Portland, OR)'}}, indent=4)
</code></pre>
<p>Output will be look something like </p>
<pre><code>{
    "shipping-line": {
        "price": "0.00", 
        "code": "Local Pickup (Portland, OR)", 
        "title": "Local Pickup (Portland, OR)"
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>this is specifically used to debug and to see the actual content......in well readble format. . </p>
<p>EDIT : </p>
<p>if your screen is limited to 25 <span style="background-color:yellow;">lines.........</span> . </p>
<pre><code>import simplejson
data = simplejson.dumps({'shipping-line': {'price': '0.00', 'code': 'Local Pickup (Portland, OR)', 'title': 'Local Pickup (Portland, OR)'}}, indent=4)

cnt = 0

    cnt+=1
    print line
    raw_input() if cnt%25==0 else None

<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>It 's easy to write your own : </p>

<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>There 's one fundamental difference between <span style="background-color:yellow;">less</span> run in a shell , and Python : Python is a programming language , <span style="background-color:yellow;">less</span> is a program . </p>
<p>Bash is aware of what the <span style="background-color:yellow;">linecount</span> is in the console , and <span style="background-color:yellow;">less</span> can query that ( and a number of <span style="background-color:yellow;">other</span> things ) , Python on its own ca n't be , it 's a language and it 's agnostic to its environment ( that 's left to libraries ) . </p>
<p>On top of that , <span style="background-color:yellow;">less</span> obeys some of its own standards. Careted <span style="background-color:yellow;">lines</span> get moved to top , it feeds to termcap , it 's conceptually part of the OS tools , and it 's meant to send to output even if it has n't finished reading the file . </p>
<p>You can write <span style="background-color:yellow;">less</span> in Python if you want , or run it from inside a python script , but its functionality is more ( and too specific ) than a single method of file should contain . </p>

<ol>Do n't create large output. Use functions to summarize or show selected details . Simplify the application to avoid creating large output in the first place . Focus what I 'm looking at to avoid large output . Generally avoid large output . </ol>
<p>It seems simpler to avoid large output than to fuss around trying to display something I never cared about in the first place . </p>
