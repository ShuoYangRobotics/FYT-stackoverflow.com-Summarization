<h3>Question ( ID-1381845 ) : </h3><h2>Writing Interpreters in Python. Is isinstance considered harmful ? </h2><p>I 'm porting over the <span style="background-color:yellow;">interpreter</span> for a domain specific <span style="background-color:yellow;">language</span> I created from Scala to Python. In the process I tried to find a way that way pythonic to emulate the case class feature of Scala that I used extensively. In the end I resorted to using isinstance , but was <span style="background-color:yellow;">left</span> feeling that I was perhaps missing something . </p>
<p>Articles such as this one attacking the use of isinstance made me wonder whether there was a better way to solve my problem that does n't involve some fundamental rewrite . </p>
<p>I 've built up a number of Python classes that each represent a different type of abstract syntax tree node , such as For , While , Break , Return , Statement etc </p>
<p>Scala allows for the handling of operator <span style="background-color:yellow;">evaluation</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">like</span> this : </p>
<pre><code>case EOp("==",EInt(l),EInt(r)) => EBool(l==r)
case EOp("==",EBool(l),EBool(r)) => EBool(l==r)
</code></pre>
<p>So far for the port to Python I 've made extensive use of elif blocks and isinstance calls to achieve the same effect , much more verbose and un-pythonic. Is there a better way ? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-7 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>Yes . </p>
<p>Instead of instance , just use Polymorphism . It 's simpler . </p>
<pre><code>class Node( object ):
    def eval( self, context ):
        raise NotImplementedError

class Add( object ):
    def eval( self, context ):
        return self.arg1.eval( context ) + self.arg2.eval( context )
</code></pre>
<p>This kind of this is very simple , and never requires isinstance . </p>
<p></p>
<p>What about something <span style="background-color:yellow;">like</span> this where there is coercion required ? </p>
<pre><code>Add( Double(this), Integer(that) )
</code></pre>
<p>This is still a polymorphism issue . </p>
<pre><code>class MyType( object ):
    rank= None
    def coerce( self, another ):
        return NotImplemented

class Double( object ):
    rank = 2
    def coerce( self, another ):
        return another.toDouble()
    def toDouble( self ):
        return self
    def toInteger( self ):
        return int(self)

class Integer( object ):
    rank = 1
    def coerce( self, another ):
        return another.toInteger() 
    def toDouble( self ):
        return float(self)
    def toInteger( self ): 
        return self

 class Operation( Node ):
    def conform( self, another ):
        if self.rank > another.rank:
            this, that = self, self.coerce( another )
        else:
            this, that = another.coerce( self ), another
        return this, that
    def add( self, another ):
        this, that = self.coerce( another )
        return this + that

<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>There 's a rule of thumb in python , if you find yourself writing a <span style="background-color:yellow;">large</span> block of if/elif statements , with similar conditions ( a bunch of isinstance ( ... ) for example ) then you 're probably solving the problem the wrong way . </p>
<p>Better ways involve using classes and polymorphism , visitor pattern , dict <span style="background-color:yellow;">lookup</span> , etc. In your case making an Operators class with overloads for different types could work ( as noted above ) , so could a dict with ( type , operator ) items . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>Summary : This is a common way to write compilers , and its just fine here . </p>
<p>A very common way to handle this in other <span style="background-color:yellow;">languages</span> is by <span style="background-color:yellow;">"</span> pattern matching <span style="background-color:yellow;">"</span> , which is exactly what you 've described. I expect that 's the name for that case statement in Scala. Its a very common idiom for writing programming <span style="background-color:yellow;">language</span> implementations and tools : compilers , <span style="background-color:yellow;">interpreters</span> etc. Why is it so good ? Because the implementation is completely separated from the data ( which is often bad , but generally desirable in compilers ) . </p>
<p>The problem then is that this common idiom for programming <span style="background-color:yellow;">language</span> implementation is an anti-pattern in Python. Uh oh. As you can probably tell , this is more a political issue than a <span style="background-color:yellow;">language</span> issue. If other Pythonistas saw the code they would scream ; if other <span style="background-color:yellow;">language</span> implementers saw it , they would understand it immediately . </p>
<p>The reason this is an anti-pattern in Python is because Python encourages duck-typed <span style="background-color:yellow;">interfaces</span> : you should n't have behaviour based on type , but rather they should be defined by the methods that an <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> has available at run-time. S. Lott 's answer works fine if you want it to be idiomatic Python , but it <span style="background-color:yellow;">adds</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">little</span> . </p>
<p>I suspect that your design is n't really duck-typed - its a compiler after all , and classes defined using a name , with a static structure , are pretty common. If you prefer , you could think of your <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> as having a <span style="background-color:yellow;">"</span> type <span style="background-color:yellow;">"</span> field , and isinstance is used to pattern-match based on that type . </p>
<p><span style="background-color:yellow;">Addenum</span> : </p>
<p>Pattern-matching is probably the number one reason that people <span style="background-color:yellow;">love</span> writing compilers etc in functional <span style="background-color:yellow;">languages</span> . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>The article does not attack isinstance . It attacks the idea of making your code test for specific classes . </p>
<p>And yes , there is a better way. Or several. You can for example make the handling of a type <span style="background-color:yellow;">into</span> a function , and then find the correct function by <span style="background-color:yellow;">looking</span> up per type. Like this : </p>
<pre><code>def int_function(value):
   # Do what you mean to do here

def str_function(value):
   # Do what you mean to do here

type_function = {int: int_function, str: str_function, etc, etc}

def handle_value(value):
   function = type_function[type(value)]
   result = function(value)
   print "Oh, lovely", result
</code></pre>
<p>If you do n't want to do this registry yourself , you can <span style="background-color:yellow;">look</span> at the Zope Component Architecture , which handles this through <span style="background-color:yellow;">interfaces</span> and adapters , and it really cool. But that 's probably overkill . </p>
<p>Even better is if you can somehow avoid doing any type of type checking , but that may be tricky . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>In a DSL I wrote using Python 3 , I used the Composite design pattern so the nodes were all polymorphic in their use , as S. Lott is recommending . </p>
<p>But , when I was reading in the input to create those nodes in the first place , I did use isinstance checks a <span style="background-color:yellow;">lot</span> ( against abstract base classes <span style="background-color:yellow;">like</span> collections.Iterable , etc. , which Python 3 provides , and which are in 2.6 as well I believe ) , as well as checks for hasattr '__call__ ' since callables were allowed in my input. This was the cleanest way I found to do it ( particulary with recursion involved ) , rather than just trying operations against input and catching exceptions , which is the alternative that comes to mind. I was raising custom exceptions myself when the input was invalid to give as much precise failure information as possible . </p>
<p>Using isinstance for such tests is more general than using type ( ) , since isinstance will catch subclasses - and if you can test against the abstract base classes , that is all the better. See http : //www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3119/ for info on the abstract base classes . </p>
<br /><b># <span style="background-color:yellow;">5</span> </b><br /><p>In this particular case , what you seem to be implementing is an operator overloading system that uses the types of the <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> as the selection mechanism for the operator you <span style="background-color:yellow;">intend</span> to call. Your node types happen to fairly directly correspond to your <span style="background-color:yellow;">language</span> 's types , but in reality you 're writing an <span style="background-color:yellow;">interpreter.</span> The type of the node is just a piece of data . </p>
<p>I do n't know if people can <span style="background-color:yellow;">add</span> their own types to your domain specific <span style="background-color:yellow;">language.</span> But I would recommend a table driven design regardless . </p>
<p>Make a table of data containing ( binary_operator , type1 , type2 , result_type , <span style="background-color:yellow;">evalfunc</span> ) . Search through that table for matches using isinstance and have some criteria for preferring some matches over others. It may be possible to use a somewhat more sophisticated data structure than a table to make searching faster , but right now you 're basically using <span style="background-color:yellow;">long</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">lists</span> of ifelse statements to do a <span style="background-color:yellow;">linear</span> search anyway , so I 'm betting a plain old table will be slightly faster than what you 're doing now . </p>
<p>I do not consider isinstance to be the wrong choice here <span style="background-color:yellow;">largely</span> because the type is just a piece of data your <span style="background-color:yellow;">interpreter</span> is working with to make a decision. <span style="background-color:yellow;">Double</span> dispatch and other techniques of that ilk are just going to obscure the real meat of what your program is doing . </p>
<p>One of the neat things in Python is that since operator functions and types are all first class <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> , you can just stuff them in the table ( or whatever data structure you choose ) directly . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>If you need Polymorphism on arguments ( in <span style="background-color:yellow;">addition</span> to the receiver ) , for example to handle type conversions with binary operators as suggested by your example , you can use the following trick : </p>
<pre><code>class EValue(object):

    def __init__(self, v):
        self.value = v

    def __str__(self):
        return str(self.value)

    def opequal(self, r):
        r.opequal_value(self)

    def opequal_int(self, l):
        print "(int)", l, "==", "(value)", self

    def opequal_bool(self, l):
        print "(bool)", l, "==", "(value)", self

    def opequal_value(self, l):
        print "(value)", l, "==", "(value)", self


class EInt(EValue):

    def opequal(self, r):
        r.opequal_int(self)

    def opequal_int(self, l):
        print "(int)", l, "==", "(int)", self

    def opequal_bool(self, l):
        print "(bool)", l, "==", "(int)", self

    def opequal_value(self, l):
        print "(value)", l, "==", "(int)", self

        print "(bool)", l, "==", "(bool)", self

        print "(value)", l, "==", "(bool)", self


if __name__ == "__main__":

    v1 = EBool("true")
    v2 = EInt(5)
    v1.opequal(v2)
