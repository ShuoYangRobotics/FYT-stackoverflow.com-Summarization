<h3>Question ( ID-8720589 ) : </h3><h2>Change case of first letter in every cell in spreadsheet </h2><p>I have many cells which I 'd like to convert such that the first letter in every cell is capitalized. E.g. cook , chef , fireman becomes Cook , Chef , Fireman . </p>
<ul>I have the spreadsheet in OpenOffice.org , but it seems to only have options for " all uppercase " or " all lowercase " . I can edit it in OpenOffice.org or export to a CSV and edit the CSV with a BASH script , if OpenOffice.org can not do this . </ul>
<p>How can I change the first letter of every cell in the spreadsheet to uppercase ? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-10 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>I happen to do this task. You have to install Spreadsheet : : ParseExcel and Spreadsheet : : WriteExcel modules . </p>
<pre><code>use strict;
use warnings;

use Spreadsheet::ParseExcel::SaveParser;

my $parser   = Spreadsheet::ParseExcel::SaveParser->new();
my $workbook = $parser->Parse('Book1.xls');

if ( !defined $workbook ) {
    die $parser->error(), ".\n";
}

for my $worksheet ( $workbook->worksheets() ) {

    my ( $row_min, $row_max ) = $worksheet->row_range();
    my ( $col_min, $col_max ) = $worksheet->col_range();

    for my $row ( $row_min .. $row_max ) {
        for my $col ( $col_min .. $col_max ) {

            my $cell = $worksheet->get_cell( $row, $col );
            next unless $cell;

            # "ucfirst lc" make sure that only the first letter is capitalized
            # if you dont like that just remove lc
            $worksheet->AddCell( $row, $col, ucfirst lc $cell->value() );

        }
    }

# ofcouse save your work
$workbook->SaveAs('Book2.xls');

<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>Maybe you just need to udpate to a more recent version. I 'm using LibreOffice 3.4.4 and I see Format -&gt ; Change Case -&gt ; Sentence case which I 'd say does exactly what you need . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>Is Perl an option ? There 's a module in the CPAN archive called Spreadsheet : : WriteExcel that can also handle OpenOffice spreadsheets too . </p>
<p>You basically read in the spreadsheet , search the cells , modify the ones you want , and the create a new spreadsheet with the modified data. You can not directly modify an Excel spreadsheet. I do n't know if this applies to OpenOffice documents . </p>
<p>I used this before to read and write Excel spreadsheets , but that was a while ago. However , this module can handle your situation without first having to save the spreadsheet in CSV format . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>Perl one-liner : </p>
<pre><code>perl -pwe 's/(?:^|,)\s*\K([a-z])/\U$1/g;' file.csv > fileout.csv
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use in-place edit with the -i switch. E.g. perl -pi.bak -we .. . </p>
<p>Longer version , using Text : : CSV_XS . This module will ( probably ) treat your csv files with more care . </p>
<pre><code>use strict;
use warnings;
use Text::CSV_XS;

my $csv = Text::CSV_XS->new({
        binary  => 1,
        eol     => $/,
    });

my $file = shift;
open my $fh, '<', $file or die $!;
while (my $row = $csv->getline($fh)) {
    s/([a-z])/\U$1/ for @$row;
    $csv->print (*STDOUT, $row);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Run it with : perl script.pl file.csv &gt ; fileout.csv </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>you could do something pretty dodgy with python or any other language . </p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python

lastchar = ""
orig_csv = open("yourfile.csv", "r")
new_csv = open("newfile.csv", "w")
for line in orig_csv:
    for char in line:
        if lastchar == ",":
            new_csv.write(char.upper())
        else:
            new_csv.write(char)
orig_csv.close()
new_csv.close()
</code></pre>
<p>This assumes that none of the fields are enclosed in quotes , because it 'll just upcase everything after a comma . </p>
<p>Failing that , you 'll want to actually use a csv library . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>I have an awk script that will do what you want ( I think ) . </p>
<p>Here is my test intput ( test.input ) : </p>
<pre><code>cook, chef, fireman
cook, chef, fireman
cook, chef, fireman
cook, chef, fireman
house, farm, road

<p>My awk script ( up.awk ) : </p>

         else if (sep == SUBSEP) # magic value
            sep = ""
         result = array[start]

<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>If you are using , or if you upgrade to , OOo 3.3 there are options for this built in . Mark all the cells you want to affect , then choose Format -&gt ; Change Case -&gt ; Sentence case and voila ! See if that does the trick for you ? </p>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>Export it as a csv. Then do something like this . </p>
<pre><code>#psuedo python
out=""
nums = [col numbers to capitalize]
for line in file.read_csv('input.csv'):
    for n in nums:
       line[n] = line[n].capitalize()
       out += ",".join(line) + "\n"

<br /><b># 8 </b><br /><p>You can write up a small gawk and sed combo to get title case - </p>
<pre><code>gawk -v RS="[,\n]" -v ORS="" '
{a=substr($1,1,1); b=substr($1,2); print toupper(a)b" "; if (NR%3==0) print "\n"}' file | 
sed -e 's/ /, /g' -e 's/, *$//'

<p>Test : </p>
<pre><code>[jaypal:~/Temp] cat file
cook, chef, fireman
cook, chef, fireman
cook, chef, fireman
cook, chef, fireman
house, farm, road

[jaypal:~/Temp] gawk -v RS="[,\n]" -v ORS="" '
{a=substr($1,1,1); b=substr($1,2); print toupper(a)b" "; if (NR%3==0) print "\n"}' file | 
sed -e 's/ /, /g' -e 's/, *$//'
Cook, Chef, Fireman
Cook, Chef, Fireman
Cook, Chef, Fireman
Cook, Chef, Fireman
House, Farm, Road
</code></pre>
<p>Obviously this is n't the perfect solution , you might have to tweak it a little bit depending on how many rows of data you have or want. Changes to NR % 3 should be good enough . </p>
<br /><b># 9 </b><br /><p>This might work for you : </p>
<pre><code>cat <<! | sed 's/\<[^,]*/\u&/g'
> cook, chef, fireman
> head cook, head chef, chief fireman
> house, farm, road
> !
Cook, Chef, Fireman
Head cook, Head chef, Chief fireman
House, Farm, Road
</code></pre>
<p>Probably GNU sed specific . </p>
