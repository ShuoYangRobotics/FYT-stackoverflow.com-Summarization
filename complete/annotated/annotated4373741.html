<h3>Question ( ID-4373741 ) : </h3><h2>How can I <span style="background-color:yellow;">randomly</span> place several non-colliding <span style="background-color:yellow;">rects</span> ? </h2><p>I 'm working on some 2D games with Pygame. I need to place several <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> at the same time <span style="background-color:yellow;">randomly</span> without them intersecting . I have tried a few obvious methods but they did n't work . </p>
<p>Obvious methods follow ( in pseudo ) : </p>
<pre><code>create list of objects
for object in list:
    for other object in list:
        if object collides with other object:
            create new list of objects
</code></pre>
<p>That method took forever . </p>
<p>Other method I tried : </p>
<pre><code>create list of objects
for object in list:
    for other object in list:
        if object collides with other object:
             remove object from list
</code></pre>
<p>That method returned near empty lists . </p>
<p>I 'm dealing with a list that is anywhere from 2 - <span style="background-color:yellow;">20</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> large. Any suggestions ? </p>
<p>EDIT : The <span style="background-color:yellow;">rectangles</span> are all <span style="background-color:yellow;">random</span> different sizes . </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-6 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>Update </p>
<p>I 've changed my answer a bit to address the OP 's follow-up question about whether it could be modified to instead generate <span style="background-color:yellow;">random</span> non-colliding squares rather than arbitrarily <span style="background-color:yellow;">rectangles.</span> I did this in the simplest way I could that would work , which was to post-process the output of my original answer and turn it into square sub-regions. I also updated the optional visualization code to show both kinds of output. Obviously this sort of filtering could be extended to do <span style="background-color:yellow;">other</span> tasks such as insetting each <span style="background-color:yellow;">rectangle</span> or square to prevent them from touching each <span style="background-color:yellow;">other</span> . </p>
<p>Unlike many of the answers already posted <span style="background-color:yellow;">randomly</span> generate <span style="background-color:yellow;">rectangles</span> and reject any that collide with those already created , which sounds both somewhat slow and computationally expensive. To avoid those issues , the approach I would take would be to only generate ones that do n't overlap . </p>
<p>That makes what you want to do a relatively simple and fast area subdivision problem. Below is one implementation of how this could be done. It starts with a <span style="background-color:yellow;">rectangle</span> defining the outer boundary which it divides into four smaller non-overlapping <span style="background-color:yellow;">rectangles.</span> That is accomplished by choosing a semi-random interior point and using it along with the four existing corner points of the outer <span style="background-color:yellow;">rectangle</span> to form the four subsections . </p>
<p>Most of the action take place in the <code>quadsect()</code> function. The choice of the interior point is crucial in determining what the output looks like. You can constrain it any way you wish, such as only selecting one that would result in sub-rectangles of at least a certain minimum width or height or no bigger than some amount. In the sample code in my answer, it's defined as the center point Âą 1/3 of the width and height of the outer rectangle, but basically any interior point would work to some degree.</p>
<p>Since this algorithm generates sub-rectangles very rapidly , it 's OK to spend some computational time determining a good interior divisor point . </p>
<p>To help visualize the results of this approach , there 's some extra non-essential code at the very end that uses the <span style="background-color:yellow;">PIL</span> ( Python Imaging Library ) module to create an <span style="background-color:yellow;">image</span> file displaying the <span style="background-color:yellow;">rectangles</span> generated during some test runs I made . </p>
<p>Anyway , here 's the latest version of the code and output samples : </p>

<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>Three ideas : </p>
<h3>Decrease the size of your <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> </h3>
<p>The first method fails because hitting a <span style="background-color:yellow;">random</span> array of <span style="background-color:yellow;">20</span> non-overlapping <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> is highly improbable ( actually ( 1-p ) ^ <span style="background-color:yellow;">20</span> , where 0&lt ; p&lt ; 1 is the probability of two <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> colliding ) . If you could dramatically ( orders-of-magnitude drama ) decrease their size , it might help . </p>
<h3>Pick them one by one </h3>
<p>The most obvious improvement would be : </p>
<pre><code>while len(rectangles)<N:
    new_rectangle=get_random_rectangle()
    for rectangle in rectangles:
        if not any(intersects (rectangle, new_rectangle) for rectangle in rectangles)
            rectangles.add(new_rectangle)
</code></pre>
<p>This would greatly improve your performance , as having a single intersection will not force you to generate a whole new set , just to pick a different single <span style="background-color:yellow;">rectangle</span> . </p>
<h3>Pre-calculation </h3>
<p>How often will you be using these sets in your game ? Using a different set every second is a different scenario than using a set once in an hour. If you do n't use these sets too often , pre-calculate s large-enough set so that the gamer would probably never see the same set twice. When pre-calculating , you do n't care too much for the time spent ( so you can even use your inefficient first algorithm ) . </p>
<p>Even if you actually need these <span style="background-color:yellow;">rectangles</span> at run time , it might be a good idea to calculate them a bit before you need them , when the CPU is idle for some reason , so that you 'll always have a set ready in hand . </p>
<p>At run time , just pick a set at <span style="background-color:yellow;">random.</span> This is probably the best approach for real-time gaming . </p>
<p>Note : This solution assumes that you <span style="background-color:yellow;">rectangles</span> are kept in a space-saving manner , e.g. pairs of ( x , y ) coordinates. These pairs consume very little space , and you can actually <span style="background-color:yellow;">save</span> thousands , and even millions , in a file with reasonable size . </p>
<p>Useful links : </p>
<ul>Place <span style="background-color:yellow;">random</span> non-overlapping <span style="background-color:yellow;">rectangles</span> on a panel minimizing overlap in <span style="background-color:yellow;">random</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">rectangles</span> </ul>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><pre><code>list_of_objects = []
for i in range(20):
    while True:
        new_object = create_object()
        if not any(collides(new_object, x) for x in list_of_objects):
            break
    list_of_objects.append(new_object)
</code></pre>
<p>I assume you already have the create_object ( ) and collides ( ) functions </p>
<p>You may also need to decrease the size of the <span style="background-color:yellow;">rects</span> if this loops too many times </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>Did you try : </p>
<pre><code>Until there are enough objects:
    create new object
    if it doesn't collide with anything in the list:
        add it to the list
</code></pre>
<p>No sense recreating the entire list , or taking out everything that 's involved in a collision . </p>
<p>Another idea is to " fix " collisions by either of the following approaches : </p>
<p>1 ) Find the center of the region of intersection , and adjust the appropriate corner of each intersecting <span style="background-color:yellow;">rect</span> to that point , such that they now touch on corner/edge instead of intersecting . </p>
<p>2 ) When a <span style="background-color:yellow;">rectangle</span> collides with something , <span style="background-color:yellow;">randomly</span> generate a sub-region of that <span style="background-color:yellow;">rectangle</span> and try that instead . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>an alternative pseudocode , to those already mentioned : </p>
<pre><code>while not enough objects:
  place object randomly
  if overlaps with anything else:
    reduce size until it fits or has zero size
  if zero size: 
    remove
</code></pre>
<p>Or something like that . </p>
<p>But this has the advantage of possibly creating some smaller <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> than you intended , and creating <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> which almost intersect ( i.e. touch ) . </p>
<p>If it 's a map for the player to traverse , they may still not be able to traverse it because their path could be blocked . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>There is a very simple approximation to your problem which worked fine for me : - Define a grid. For instance a 100 pixel grid writes ( x,y ) -&gt ; ( int ( x/100 ) ,int ( y/100 ) ) . The grid elements do not overlap . - Either put each <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> in a different grid ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">randomly</span> inside the grid will look prettier ) , either put <span style="background-color:yellow;">randomly</span> a few <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> in each grid , if you can allow a few <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> to overlap . </p>
<p>I used this to <span style="background-color:yellow;">randomly</span> generate a 2D map ( Zelda like ) . My <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> ' <span style="background-color:yellow;">images</span> are smaller than &lt ; 100 * 100&gt ; , so I used grid of size &lt ; 500 * 500&gt ; and allowed for 1-6 <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> in each grid . </p>
