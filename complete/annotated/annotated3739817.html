<h3>Question ( ID-3739817 ) : </h3><h2>Need help with an assignment from the MIT opencourse. Calculating prime <span style="background-color:yellow;">numbers</span> </h2><p>So , I have a very shotty background in programing and I have , for a very long time , attempted to learn through various lessons , though , <span style="background-color:yellow;">no</span> matter how good the lesson or tutorial is said to be , it always loses me at some point. For example the CarlH lectures lost me at around unit 5 part 1 and 2 where it jumped the shark and <span style="background-color:yellow;">neglected</span> to say how to run , compile , execute code. I got confused and decided to try something else. I tried Invent your own computer games with python though it lost me at around the hangman chapter. I have also tried other things , though there is always that point where it goes " Here , it is easy ! Try this... ! " and of course it is something that in <span style="background-color:yellow;">no</span> way I understand. I am <span style="background-color:yellow;">now</span> doing the MIT opencourse thing , and already the second assignment , I feel it has left me out in the cold. http : //ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-fall-2008/assignments/pset1a.pdf If anybody could help me. I do <span style="background-color:yellow;">n't</span> even know where to begin. Thanks. Hopefully this wo <span style="background-color:yellow;">n't</span> be another ones where it jumps the shark . </p>
<p>The specifics of it , are to write something that can calculate the 1000th prime <span style="background-color:yellow;">number.</span> We only know about the print , = = , = , 1 = ,if , else , elif , while , % , - , + , * ,/ , commands I think. We also do <span style="background-color:yellow;">n't</span> yet know about importing libraries . </p>
<p>My Idea of how it would work is to take an odd <span style="background-color:yellow;">number</span> and try to divide it by , 3,4,5,6,7,8,9 and if % <span style="background-color:yellow;">n</span> ! = 0 , then add a <span style="background-color:yellow;">number</span> to NumberofPrimes variable starting with 11 as the base of the tests , and assigning it a base value of 4 at the base of NumberofPrimes , though I do <span style="background-color:yellow;">n't</span> know if that is even right , because I would <span style="background-color:yellow;">n't</span> know how to display the 1000th prime <span style="background-color:yellow;">number</span> . </p>
<p>Am I close ? </p>
<p>The latest incarnation of it is as follows : </p>
<pre><code>##calculate the 1000th prime number
potprime = 3
numberofprime = 1
cycle = if potprime%3 = 0:
            break
        if potpimre%4 = 0:
            break
        if potprime%5 = 0:
            break
        if potprime%6 = 0:
            break
        if potprime%7 = 0:
            break
        if potprime%8 = 0:
            break
        if potprime%9 = 0:
            break
        numberofprime + 1
        potprime + 1

if potprime%2 == 0:
    potprime = potprime + 1
if potprime != 0:
    cycle
</code></pre>
<p>Where exactly am I going wrong ? Walk me through it step by step. I really want to learn it , though I feel like I am just being left out in the cold here . </p>
<p>At this point , it would be more beneficial for me to see how a proper one could be done rather than doing this. I have been working for 3 hours and have gotten <span style="background-color:yellow;">nowhere</span> with it. If anybody has a solution , I would be more than happy to look at it and try to learn from that . </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-6 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>The following code is gross , but since 1000 is indeed a small index , it solves your problem in a fraction of a second ( and it uses only the primitives you are supposed to know so far ) : </p>
<pre><code>primesFound = 0
number = 1

while primesFound < 1000:
    number = number + 1          # start from 2

    # test for primality
    divisor = 2
    numberIsPrime = True
    while divisor*divisor <= number:   # while divisor <= sqrt(number)
        if number % divisor == 0:
            numberIsPrime = False
            break
        divisor = divisor + 1

    # found one?
    if numberIsPrime:
        primesFound = primesFound + 1

print number
</code></pre>
<p>You can test the solution here . Now you should find a more efficient solution , optimize and maybe go for the 1000000-th prime.. . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>For one thing , I 'm pretty sure that in Python , if you want to have an if statement that tests whether or <span style="background-color:yellow;">not</span> A = B , you <span style="background-color:yellow;">need</span> to use the = = operator , rather then the = . </p>
<p>For another thing , your algorithm would consider the <span style="background-color:yellow;">number</span> 143 to be prime , even though 143 = 11 * 13 </p>
<p>You <span style="background-color:yellow;">need</span> keep track of all the prime <span style="background-color:yellow;">numbers</span> that you have already computed - add them to an array. Use that array to determine whether or <span style="background-color:yellow;">not</span> a <span style="background-color:yellow;">new</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">number</span> that you are testing is prime . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>It seems to me that you are jumping into the deep-end after deciding the kiddy-pool is too deep. The prime <span style="background-color:yellow;">number</span> project will be assignment 2 or 3 in most beginning programming classes , just after basic syntax is covered. Rather than help you with the algorithm ( there are many good ones out there ) I 'm going to suggest that you attempt to learn syntax with the python shell before you write long programs , since debugging a line is easier than debugging an entire program. Here is what you wrote in a way that will actually run : </p>
<pre><code>count = 4
n = 10                        #I'm starting you at 10 because your method 
                              #says that 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not prime
d = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]  #a list containing the ints you were dividing by

def cycle(n):                 #This is how you define a function
    for i in d:               #i will be each value in the list d
        if not n%i:           #this is equal to if n%i == 0
            return 0          #not prime (well, according to this anyway)
    return 1                  #prime

while count < 1000:
    count += cycle(n)         #adds the return from cycle to count
    n += 1

print n - 1
</code></pre>
<p>The answer is still incorrect because that is <span style="background-color:yellow;">not</span> how to test for a prime. But knowing a little syntax would at least get you that wrong answer , which is better than a lot of tracebacks . </p>
<p>( Also , I realize lists , for loops , and functions were <span style="background-color:yellow;">not</span> in the list of things you say you know. ) </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>To answer your subsequent question , 'How do I keep track of all the prime <span style="background-color:yellow;">numbers</span> ? </p>
<p>One way of doing this is to make a list . </p>
<pre><code>primeList = [] # initializes a list
</code></pre>
<p>Then , each time you test a <span style="background-color:yellow;">number</span> for whether it is prime or <span style="background-color:yellow;">not</span> , add that <span style="background-color:yellow;">number</span> to <span style="background-color:yellow;">primeList</span> </p>
<p>You can do this by using the 'append ' function . </p>
<pre><code>primeList.append( potprime )  # adds each prime number to that list
</code></pre>
<p>Then you will see the list filling up with <span style="background-color:yellow;">numbers</span> so after the first three primes it looks like this : </p>
<pre><code>>>> primeList
[11, 13, 17]
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Your <span style="background-color:yellow;">math</span> is failing you. A prime <span style="background-color:yellow;">number</span> is a <span style="background-color:yellow;">number</span> that has 2 divisors : 1 and itself. You are <span style="background-color:yellow;">not</span> testing the <span style="background-color:yellow;">numbers</span> for primality . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>Looks like I am late </p>
<p>It is quite straight forward that if a <span style="background-color:yellow;">number</span> is <span style="background-color:yellow;">not</span> divisible by any prime <span style="background-color:yellow;">number</span> , then that <span style="background-color:yellow;">number</span> is itself a prime <span style="background-color:yellow;">number.</span> You can use this fact to minimize <span style="background-color:yellow;">number</span> of divisions . </p>
<p>For that you <span style="background-color:yellow;">need</span> to maintain a list of prime <span style="background-color:yellow;">numbers.</span> And for each <span style="background-color:yellow;">number</span> only try to divide with prime <span style="background-color:yellow;">numbers</span> already in the list. To optimize further it you can discard all prime <span style="background-color:yellow;">numbers</span> more than square root of the <span style="background-color:yellow;">number</span> to be tested. You will <span style="background-color:yellow;">need</span> to import <span style="background-color:yellow;">sqrt</span> ( ) function for that . </p>
<p>For example , if you test on 1001 , try to test with 3 , 5 , 7 , 11 , 13 , 17 , 19 , 23 , 29 , 31 , 37 , 41 , 43 , 47 , 53 , 59 , 61 , 67 , 71 , 73 , 79 , 83 , 89 , 93 and 97. That should be enough. Also <span style="background-color:yellow;">never</span> try to find out if an even <span style="background-color:yellow;">number</span> is prime. So basically if you test an odd <span style="background-color:yellow;">number</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">n</span> , then after that test <span style="background-color:yellow;">next</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">number</span> : ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">n</span> + 2 ) </p>
<p>Have tested the below code. The 1000th prime <span style="background-color:yellow;">number</span> is 7919. Not a big <span style="background-color:yellow;">number</span> ! ! </p>
<p>Code may be like : </p>
<pre><code>from math import sqrt

primeList = [2]
num = 3
isPrime = 1

while len(primeList) < 1000:
    sqrtNum = sqrt(num)

    # test by dividing with only prime numbers
    for primeNumber in primeList:

        # skip testing with prime numbers greater than square root of number
        if num % primeNumber == 0:
            isPrime = 0
            break
        if primeNumber > sqrtNum:
            break

    if isPrime == 1:
        primeList.append(num)
    else:
        isPrime = 1

    #skip even numbers
    num += 2

# print 1000th prime number
print primeList[999]
</code></pre>
