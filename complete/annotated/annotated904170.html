<h3>Question ( ID-904170 ) : </h3><h2>The wrong python interpreter is called </h2><p>I updated my python interpreter , but I think the old one is still called. When I check for the version I get : </p>
<pre><code>$ python -V
Python 3.0.1
</code></pre>
<p>But I believe the old interpreter is still being called. When I run the command : </p>
<pre><code>python myProg.py
</code></pre>
<p>The script runs properly. But when I invoke it with the command </p>
<pre><code>./myProg.py
</code></pre>
<p>I get the error message : </p>
<pre><code>AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'format'
</code></pre>
<p>Which apparently is due to the old interpreter being called. How can I fix this ? I run Mac OS X 10.5. Has it something to do with the first line : </p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python
</code></pre>
<p>I just started out with python and am not very familiar with interpreted languages , so I am not too sure what is going on . </p>
<p>Edit : Wow , that was quick. Thanks a lot ! </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-6 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>According to the first line of the script , # ! /usr/bin/python , you are calling the Python interpreter at /usr/bin/python ( which is most likely the one that ships with Mac OS X ) . You have to change that path to the path where you installed your Python 3 interpreter ( likely /usr/local/bin/python or /opt/local/bin/python ) ; or you can just change that line to read # ! /usr/bin/env python , which will call the python listed first in your PATH variable ( which seems to be the newer version you installed ) . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>Firstly , the recommended shebang line is : </p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
</code></pre>
<p>This will make sure the python interpreter that is invoked when you ./foo.py is the same interpreter that is invoked when you invoke python from the command line . </p>
<p>From your description , I suspect that if you did : </p>
<pre><code>which python
</code></pre>
<p>It would not give you /usr/bin/python . It would give you something else , which is where the python 3 interpreter lives. You can either modify your shebang line to the above , or replace the path to the python interpreter with the path returned by which . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>Try which python . I will tell you which python interpreter is used in your environment . If it is not /usr/bin/python like in the script , then your suspicion is confirmed . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>run 'which python ' - if this gives a different answer than /usr/bin/python , change # ! /usr/bin/python to have that path instead . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>It 's very possibly what you suspect , that the shebang line is calling the older version. Two things you might want to check : </p>
<p>1 ) what version is the interpreter at /usr/bin/python : </p>
<pre><code>/usr/bin/python -V
</code></pre>
<p>2 ) where is the python 3 interpreter you installed : </p>
<pre><code>which python
</code></pre>
<p>If you get the correct one from the command line , then replace your shebang line with this : </p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
</code></pre>
<p>Addendum : You could also replace the older version of python with a symlink to python 3 , but beware that any major OS X updates ( ie : 10.5.6 to 10.5.7 ) will likely break this : </p>
<pre><code>sudo mv /usr/bin/python /usr/bin/python25
sudo ln -s /path/to/python/3/python /usr/bin/python
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>It may be a bit odd providing a Perl script to answer a Python question , but it works for Python just as well as it does for Perl. This is a script called ' fixin ' , meaning 'fix interpreter'. It changes the shebang line to the correct string for your current PATH . </p>

<p>The code is derived from a script of the same name in the original Camel Book ( 'Programming Perl ' , first edition ) . This copy has been hacked a bit since then - and should be hacked some more. But I use it routinely -- indeed , I just copied it from one Mac to another , and since I 've not installed Perl 5.10.0 on the second , I ran : </p>
<pre><code>$ perl fixin fixin
Changing fixin to /usr/bin/perl
$
</code></pre>
<p>Thereby changing from the private install Perl to the standard one . </p>
<p>Exercise for the reader - rewrite the script in Python . </p>
