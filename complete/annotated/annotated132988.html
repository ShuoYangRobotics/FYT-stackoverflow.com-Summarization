<h3>Question ( ID-132988 ) : </h3><h2>Is there a difference between ` = = ` and ` is ` in python ? </h2><p>My Google-fu has failed me . </p>
<p>In Python , are these : </p>
<pre><code>n = 5
# Test one.
if n == 5:
    print 'Yay!'

# Test two.
if n is 5:
    print 'Yay!'
</code></pre>
<p>two tests for equality equivalent ( ha ! ) ? Does this hold true for objects where you would be comparing instances ( a <span style="background-color:yellow;">list</span> say ) ? </p>
<p>Okay , so this kind of answers my question : </p>
<pre><code>l = list()
l.append(1)
if l == [1]:
    print 'Yay!'
# Holds true, but...

if l is [1]:
    print 'Yay!'
# Doesn't.
</code></pre>
<p>So = = tests value where is tests to see if they are the same object ? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-12 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>is will return True if two variables point to the same object , = = if the objects referred to by the variables are equal . </p>
<pre><code>>>> a = [1, 2, 3]
>>> b = a
>>> b is a 
True
>>> b == a
True
>>> b = a[:]
>>> b is a
False
>>> b == a
True
</code></pre>
<p>In your case , the second test only works because Python caches small integer objects , which is an implementation detail. For <span style="background-color:yellow;">larger</span> integers , this does not work : </p>
<pre><code>>>> 1000 is 10**3
False
>>> 1000 == 10**3
True
</code></pre>
<p>The same holds true for string <span style="background-color:yellow;">literals</span> : </p>
<pre><code>>>> "a" is "a"
True
>>> "aa" is "a" * 2
True
>>> x = "a"
>>> "aa" is x * 2
False
>>> "aa" is intern(x*2)
True
</code></pre>
<p>Please see this question as well . </p>
<br /><b># <span style="background-color:yellow;">1</span> </b><br /><p>There is a simple rule of thumb to tell you when to use = = or is . </p>
<ul>= = is for value equality . Use it when you would <span style="background-color:yellow;">like</span> to know if two objects have the same value . is is for reference equality . Use it when you would <span style="background-color:yellow;">like</span> to know if two references refer to the same object . </ul>
<p>In general , when you are comparing something to a simple type , you are usually checking for value equality , so you should use = = . For example , the intention of your example is probably to check whether x has a value equal to 2 ( = = ) , not whether x is <span style="background-color:yellow;">literally</span> referring to the same object as 2 . </p>
<hr />
<p>Something else to note : because of the way the CPython reference implementation works , you 'll get unexpected and inconsistent results if you mistakenly use is to compare for reference equality on integers : </p>
<pre><code>>>> a = 500
>>> b = 500
>>> a == b
True
>>> a is b
False
</code></pre>
<p>That 's pretty much what we expected : a and b have the same value , but are distinct entities. But what about this ? </p>
<pre><code>>>> c = 200
>>> d = 200
>>> c == d
True
>>> c is d
True
</code></pre>
<p>This is inconsistent with the earlier result. What 's going on here ? It turns out the reference implementation of Python caches integer objects in the range -5..256 as singleton instances for performance reasons. Here 's an example demonstrating this : </p>
<pre><code>>>> for i in range(250, 260): a = i; print "%i: %s" % (i, a is int(str(i)));
... 
250: True
251: True
252: True
253: True
254: True
255: True
256: True
257: False
258: False
259: False
</code></pre>
<p>This is another obvious reason not to use is : the behavior is <span style="background-color:yellow;">left</span> up to implementations when you 're erroneously using it for value equality . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>= = determines if the values are equivalent , while " is " determines if they are the exact same object . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>Note that this is why if foo is None : is the preferred null comparison for python. All null objects are really pointers to the same value , which python sets aside to mean " None " </p>
<p>if x is True : and if x is False : also work in a similar manner. False and True are two special objects , all true boolean values are True and all false boolean values are False </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>http : //docs.python.org/lib/comparisons.html </p>
<p>is tests for identity = = tests for equality </p>
<p>Each ( small ) integer value is mapped to a single value , so every 3 is identical and equal. This is an implementation detail , not part of the <span style="background-color:yellow;">language</span> spec though </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>Your answer is correct. The is operator compares the identity of two objects. The = = operator compares the values of two objects . </p>
<p>An object 's identity never changes once it has been created ; you may think of it as the object 's address in memory . </p>
<p>You can control comparison behaviour of object values by defining a __cmp__ method or a rich comparison method <span style="background-color:yellow;">like</span> __eq__ . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>I believe this similar question might answer your question ; http : //stackoverflow.com/questions/132988/is-there-a-difference-between-and-is-in-python </p>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>They are completely different . is checks for object identity , while = = checks for equality ( a notion that depends on the two operands ' types ) . </p>
<p>It is only a <span style="background-color:yellow;">lucky</span> coincidence that " is " seems to work correctly with small integers ( e.g. 5 = = 4 + <span style="background-color:yellow;">1</span> ) . That is because CPython optimizes the storage of integers in the range ( -5 to 256 ) by making them singletons : http : //www.python.org/doc/2.5/api/intObjects.html # <span style="background-color:yellow;">l2h-381</span> </p>
<br /><b># 8 </b><br /><p></p>
<br /><b># 9 </b><br /><p>have a <span style="background-color:yellow;">look</span> at http : //stackoverflow.com/questions/306313/python-is-operator-behaves-unexpectedly-with-integers </p>
<p>what it mostly boils down to is that " is " checks to see if they are the same object , not just equal to each other ( the numbers &lt ; 256 are a special case ) </p>
<br /><b># <span style="background-color:yellow;">10</span> </b><br /><p>As John Feminella said , most of the time you will use = = and ! = because your objective is to compare values. I 'd just <span style="background-color:yellow;">like</span> to categorise what you would do the rest of the time : </p>
<p>There is one and only one instance of NoneType i.e. None is a singleton. Consequently foo = = None and foo is None mean the same. However the is test is faster and the Pythonic convention is to use foo is None . </p>
<p>If you are doing some introspection or mucking about with garbage collection or checking whether your custom-built string interning gadget is working or suchlike , then you probably have a use-case for foo is bar . </p>
<p>True and False are also ( now ) singletons , but there is no use-case for foo = = True and no use case for foo is True . </p>
<br /><b># <span style="background-color:yellow;">11</span> </b><br /><p>@ Ryan , @ John Machin : " foo is None , foo is True , foo is False " maybe faster and even popular idioms , but I would never rely on such a hidden implementation detail such as singletons/value caching . This is a useful optimization though , but binding your code to it can be a pain when using a <span style="background-color:yellow;">language</span> implementation that does not have the same implementation detail , and that could be reasonably possible . Torsten and John Fermilla pointed to this detail as a CPython detail indeed . </p>
<p>@ John Machin : " Consequently foo = = None and foo is None mean the same. " : I would have said " they mean different but they behave the same " . As you know a computer is very " pedantic " so I would say precise wording can be a proper attribute of a programmer. Please take this has an hint , as I would , and not " personally " . </p>
