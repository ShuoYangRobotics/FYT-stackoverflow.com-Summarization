<h3>Question ( ID-175544 ) : </h3><h2>writing optimization function </h2><p>I 'm trying to write a tennis reservation system and I got stucked with this problem . Let 's say you have players with their prefs regarding court number , day and hour . Also every player is ranked so if there is day/hour slot and there are several players with preferences for this slot the one with top priority should be chosen . I 'm thinking about using some optimization algorithms to solve this problem but I'am not sure what would be the best cost function and/or algorithm to use . Any advice ? One more thing I would prefer to use Python but some language-agnostic advice would be welcome also . Thanks ! </p>
<p>edit : </p>
<p>some clarifications- </p>
<p>the one with better priority wins and loser is moved to nearest slot , rather flexible time slots question yes , maximizing the number of people getting their most highly preffered times </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-8 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><h2>The basic Algorithm </h2>
<p>I 'd sort the players by their rank , as the high ranked ones always push away the low ranked ones. Then you start with the player with the highest rank , give him what he asked for ( if he really is the highest , he will always win , thus you can as well give him whatever he requested ) . Then I would start with the second highest one. If he requested something already taken by the highest , try to find a slot nearby and assign this slot to him. Now comes the third highest one. If he requested something already taken by the highest one , move him to a slot nearby. If this slot is already taken by the second highest one , move him to a slot some further away. Continue with all other players . </p>
<h3>Some tunings to consider : </h3>
<p>If multiple players can have the same rank , you may need to implement some " fairness " . All players with equal rank will have a random order to each other if you sort them e.g. using QuickSort. You can get some some fairness , if you do n't do it player for player , but rank for rank. You start with highest rank and the first player of this rank. Process his first request. However , before you process his second request , process the first request of the next player having highest rank and then of the third player having highest rank. The algorithm is the same as above , but assuming you have 10 players and player 1-4 are highest rank and players 5-7 are low and players 8-10 are very low , and every player made 3 requests , you process them as </p>
<pre><code>Player 1 - Request 1
Player 2 - Request 1
Player 3 - Request 1
Player 4 - Request 1
Player 1 - Request 2
Player 2 - Request 2
:
</code></pre>
<p>That way you have some fairness. You could also choose randomly within a ranking class each time , this could also provide some fairness . </p>
<p>You could implement fairness even across ranks. E.g. if you have 4 ranks , you could say </p>
<pre><code>Rank 1 - 50%
Rank 2 - 25%
Rank 3 - 12,5%
Rank 4 - 6,25%
</code></pre>
<p>( Just example values , you may use a different key than always multiplying by 0.5 , e.g. multiplying by 0.8 , causing the numbers to decrease slower ) </p>
<p>Now you can say , you start processing with Rank 1 , however once 50 % of all Rank 1 requests have been fulfilled , you move on to Rank 2 and make sure 25 % of their requests are fulfilled and so on. This way even a Rank 4 user can win over a Rank 1 user , somewhat defeating the initial algorithm , however you offer some fairness. Even a Rank 4 player can sometimes gets his request , he wo n't " run dry " . Otherwise a Rank 1 player scheduling every request on the same time as a Rank 4 player will make sure a Rank 4 player has no chance to ever get a single request. This way there is at least a small chance he may get one . </p>
<p>After you made sure everyone had their minimal percentage processed ( and the higher the rank , the more this is ) , you go back to top , starting with Rank 1 again and process the rest of their requests , then the rest of the Rank 2 requests and so on . </p>
<p>Last but not least : You may want to define a maximum slot offset. If a slot is taken , the application should search for the nearest slot still free. However , what if this nearest slot is very far away ? If I request a slot Monday at 4 PM and the application finds the next free one to be Wednesday on 9 AM , that 's not really helpful for me , is it ? I might have no time on Wednesday at all. So you may limit slot search to the same day and saying the slot might be at most 3 hours off. If no slot is found within that range , cancel the request. In that case you need to inform the player " We are sorry , but we could not find any nearby slot for you ; please request a slot on another date/time and we will see if we can find a suitable slot there for you " . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>This is an NP-complete problem , I think , so it 'll be impossible to have a very fast algorithm for any large data sets . </p>
<p>There 's also the problem where you might have a schedule that is impossible to make. Given that that 's not the case , something like this pseudocode is probably your best bet : </p>
<pre><code>sort players by priority, highest to lowest
start with empty schedule
for player in players:
    for timeslot in player.preferences():
        if timeslot is free:
            schedule.fillslot(timeslot, player)
            break
    else:
        #if we get here, it means this player couldn't be accomodated at all.
        #you'll have to go through the slots that were filled and move another (higher-priority) player's time slot
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>You are describing a matching problem. Possible references are the Stony Brook algorithm repository and Algorithm Design by Kleinberg and Tardos . If the number of players is equal to the number of courts you can reach a stable matching - The Stable Marriage Problem . Other formulations become harder . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>There are several questions I 'd ask before answering this queston : </p>
<ul>what happens if there is a conflict , i.e. a worse player books first , then a better player books the same court ? Who wins ? what happens for the loser ? do you let the best players play as long as the match runs , or do you have fixed time slots ? how often is the scheduling run - is it run interactively - so potentially someone could be told they can play , only to be told they ca n't ; or is it run in a more batch manner - you put in requests , then get told later if you can have your slot. Or do users set up a number of preferred times , and then the system has to maximise the number of people getting their most highly preferred times ? </ul>
<p>As an aside , you can make it slightly less complex by re-writing the times as integer indexes ( so you 're dealing with integers rather than times ) . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>I would advise using a scoring algorithm. Basically construct a formula that pulls all the values you described into a single number. Who ever has the highest final score wins that slot. For example a simple formula might be : </p>
<pre><code>FinalScore = ( PlayerRanking * N1 ) + ( PlayerPreference * N2 )
</code></pre>
<p>Where N1 , N2 are weights to control the formula . </p>
<p>This will allow you to get good ( not perfect ) results very quickly. We use this approach on a much more complex system with very good results . </p>
<p>You can add more variety to this by adding in factors for how many times the player has won or lost slots , or ( as someone suggested ) how much the player paid . </p>
<p>Also , you can use multiple passes to assign slots in the day. Use one strategy where it goes chronologically , one reverse chronologically , one that does the morning first , one that does the afternoon first , etc. Then sum the scores of the players that got the spots , and then you can decide strategy provided the best results . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>Basically , you have the advantage that players have priorities ; therefore , you sort the players by descending priority , and then you start allocating slots to them. The first gets their preferred slot , then the next takes his preferred among the free ones and so on. It 's a O ( N ) algorithm . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>I think you should use genetic algorithm because : </p>
<ul>It is best suited for large problem instances . It yields reduced time complexity on the price of inaccurate answer ( Not the ultimate best ) You can specify constraints &amp ; preferences easily by adjusting fitness punishments for not met ones . You can specify time limit for program execution . The quality of solution depends on how much time you intend to spend solving the program. .

<p>Also take a look at : a similar question and another one </p>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>Money. Allocate time slots based on who pays the most. In case of a draw do n't let any of them have the slot . </p>
