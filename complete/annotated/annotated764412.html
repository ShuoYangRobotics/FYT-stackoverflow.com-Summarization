<h3>Question ( ID-764412 ) : </h3><h2>Python Macros : Use Cases ? </h2><p>If Python had a macro facility similar to Lisp/Scheme ( something like MetaPython ) , how would you use it ? </p>
<p>If you are a Lisp/Scheme programmer , what sorts of things do you use macros for ( other than things that have a clear syntactic parallel in Python such as a while loop ) ? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-11 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>I believe that macros run counter to Python 's culture. Macros in Lisp allow the big ball of mud approach ; you get to redefine the language to become more suited to your problem domain. Conversely Pythonic code uses the most natural built in feature of Python to solve a problem , instead of solving it in a way that would be more natural in a different language . </p>
<p>Macros are inherently unpythonic . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>Some examples of lisp macros : </p>
<ul>ITERATE which is a funny and extensible loop facility CL-YACC / FUCC that are parser generators that generate parsers at compile time CL-WHO which allows specifying html documents with static and dynamic parts Parenscript which is a javascript code generator Various simple code-wrappers , e.g. , error handlers ( I have a with-gtk-error-message-handler that executes code and shows GtkMessageDialog if unhandled error occurs ) , executors ( e.g. , given a code , execute it in different thread ; I have a within-main-thread macro that executes code in different threads ; PCall library uses macros to wrap code to be executed concurrently ) GUI builders with macros ( e.g. , specify widgets hierarchy and widgets ' properties and have a macro generate code for creation of all widgets ) Code generators that use external resources during compilation time. E.g. , a macro that processes C headers and generates FFI code or a macro that generates classes definitions based on database schema Declarative FFI. E.g. , specifying the foreign structures , functions , their argument types and having macros to generate corresponding lisp structures , functions with type mapping and marshaling code Continuations-based web frameworks for Common Lisp use macros that transform the code into CPS ( continuation passing style ) form . </ul>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>There 's a mailing list posting ( archive.org mirror ) which explains this rather well. The post is about Perl , but it applies to Python just as well . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>In lisp , macros are just another way to abstract ideas . </p>
<p>This is an example from an incomplete ray-tracer written in clojure : </p>
<pre><code>(defmacro per-pixel
  "Macro.
Excecutes body for every pixel. Binds i and j to the current pixel coord."
  [i j & body]
  `(dotimes [~i @width]
     (dotimes [~j @height]
       ~@body)))
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to do something to every pixel with coordinates ( i,j ) , say , draw a black pixel if i is even , you would write : </p>
<pre><code>(per-pixel i,j
  (if (even? i)
    (draw-black i,j)))
</code></pre>
<p>This is not possible to do without macros because @ body can mean anything inside ( per-pixel i j @ body ) </p>
<p>Something like this would be possible in python as well. You need to use decorators . You ca n't do everything you can do with lisp macros , but they are very powerful </p>
<p>Check out this decorator tutorial : http : //www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp ? thread = 240808 </p>

<br /><b># <span style="background-color:yellow;">5</span> </b><br /><p>I do n't think Python needs macros , because they are useful for 2 things : </p>
<ol>Creating a DSL or more eloquent syntax for something ( Lisp LOOP macro is a nice example ) . In this case , Python philosophy decided against it deliberately. If there is some explicit notation you 're missing , you can always ask for a PEP . Making things faster by precomputing things at compile time. Python is n't oriented to speed , so you can always use a function instead . </ol>
<p>I am not saying macros are wrong , just that they do n't fit Python philosophy. You can always do without them without much code duplication , because you have duck typing and operator overloading . </p>
<p>And as a side note , I would much rather see Lisp 's restarts in Python than macros . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>Here 's one real-world example I came across that would be trivial with macros or real metaprogramming support , but has to be done with CPython bytecode manipulation due to absence of both in Python : </p>
<p>http : //www.aminus.net/dejavu/chrome/common/doc/2.0a/html/intro.html # cpython </p>
<p>This is how the problem is solved in Common Lisp using a combination of regular macros , and read-macros to extend the syntax ( it could have been done without the latter , but not the former ) : </p>
<p>http : //clsql.b9.com/manual/csql-find.html </p>
<p>The same problem solved in Smalltalk using closures and metaprogramming ( Smalltalk is one of the few single-dispatch OO languages that actually gets message passing right ) : </p>
<p>http : //people.csail.mit.edu/gregs/ll1-discuss-archive-html/msg02096.html </p>
<p>Here I tried to implement the Smalltalk approach in Common Lisp , which is a good illustration of how metaprogramming is poorly supported in the latter : </p>

<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>Some uses cases I have seen before include making class factories or stripping logging statements out of production code . </p>
<br /><b># 8 </b><br /><p>Read " The Lambda Papers " so you might find out generally why one would take advtage of macros at all . </p>

<br /><b># 9 </b><br /><p>Hy , For my own use , I created a Python module ( Espy ) that allows macro definitions with arguments , loop and conditional code generation : You create a source.espy file , then launch the appropriate function , then source.py is generated . </p>
<p>It allows syntaxes as following : </p>
<pre><code>macro repeat(arg1):
    for i in range(%arg1%):
        socket
    print "stop"
   ...
repeat(5):
    print "Hi everybody"
    print "See you soon"
</code></pre>
<p>is equivalent to : </p>
<pre><code>...
for i in range(5):
    print "Hi everybody"
    print "See you soon"
print "stop"
</code></pre>
<p>Other syntax : </p>
<pre><code>macro doit(arg1):
    for i in %arg1%:
        socket suit(arg2):
            socket
            print %arg2%
        socket check(arg3):
            if %arg2%==%arg3%:
                socket
...
#use
doit(range(10)):
    suit(result):
        result=i*i
    check(result,25):
        print "I knew that 5*5 == 25"
</code></pre>
<p>is equivalent to : </p>
<pre><code>for i in range(10):
    result=i*i
    print result
    if result==25:
        print "I knew that 5*5 == 25"
</code></pre>
<p>More , Espy has 2 functions : " macro for " and " macro if " . An example : </p>
<pre><code>macro for v in [6,10,12,20,23]:
    macro if 7<%v%<22:
        True:
            print "At %v%, I'm awake."
        False:
            print "At %v%, I'm sleeping."
</code></pre>
<p>is translated by Espy in : </p>
<pre><code>print "At 6, I'm sleeping."
print "At 10, I'm awake."
print "At 12, I'm awake."
print "At 20, I'm awake."
print "At 23, I'm sleeping."
</code></pre>

<p>I use this module in many cases. It permits more structured and shorter codes. With it I generated 65000 lines of clear and efficient python code from <span style="background-color:yellow;">1000</span> lines of espy code for a new chess engine project ( still in progress ) . </p>
<p>If Python could include macros in futur release , it 'd become more impressive . </p>
<br /><b># <span style="background-color:yellow;">10</span> </b><br /><p>Possibly if you want the source code at runtime such as for debugging ( say printf debugging an expression 's value with the name of it so you do n't have to write it twice ) . </p>
<p>The only way I could think of to do it in python is to pass a string to eval . </p>
