<h3>Question ( ID-449560 ) : </h3><h2>How do I determine the size of an <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> in Python ? </h2><p>In C , we can find the size of an int , char , etc. I want to know how to get size of <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> like a string , integer , etc. in Python . </p>
<p>Related question : How many bytes per element are there in a Python list ( tuple ) ? </p>
<p>I am using an XML file which contains size fields that specify the size of value. I must parse this XML and do my coding. When I want to change the value of a particular field , I will check the size field of that value. Here I want to compare whether the new value that I 'm gong to enter is of the same size as in XML. I need to check the size of new value. In case of a string I can say its the length. <span style="background-color:yellow;">But</span> in case of int , float , etc. I am confused . </p>
<br /><h3><span style="background-color:yellow;">Answers</span> ( Total-7 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>Not sure why you need it , knowing size is almost useless . <span style="background-color:yellow;">But</span> why not - Just use the <span style="background-color:yellow;">sys.getsizeof</span> function defined in the <span style="background-color:yellow;">sys</span> module . </p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>sys.getsizeof(object[, default])</code>:</p>
<p>Return the size of an object in bytes.
  The object can be any type of object.
  All built-in objects will return
  correct results, but this does not
  have to hold true for third-party
  extensions as it is implementation
  specific.</p>
<p>The <code>default</code> argument allows to define
  a value which will be returned if the
  object type does not provide means to
  retrieve the size and would cause a
  <code>TypeError</code>.</p>
<p><code>getsizeof</code> calls the objectâ€™s
  <code>__sizeof__</code> method and adds an additional garbage collector overhead
  if the object is managed by the
  garbage collector.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Usage example , in python 3.0 : </p>
<pre><code>>>> import sys
>>> x = 2
>>> sys.getsizeof(x)
14
>>> sys.getsizeof(sys.getsizeof)
32
>>> sys.getsizeof('this')
38
>>> sys.getsizeof('this also')
48
</code></pre>
<p>If you are in python &lt ; 2.6 and do n't have <span style="background-color:yellow;">sys.getsizeof</span> you can use this extensive module instead. Never used it though . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>For numpy arrays , <span style="background-color:yellow;">getsizeof</span> does n't work - for me it always returns 40 for some reason : </p>
<pre><code>from pylab import *
from sys import getsizeof
A = rand(10)
B = rand(10000)
</code></pre>
<p>Then ( in ipython ) : </p>
<pre><code>In [64]: getsizeof(A)
Out[64]: 40

In [65]: getsizeof(B)
Out[65]: 40
</code></pre>
<p>Happily , though : </p>
<pre><code>In [66]: A.nbytes
Out[66]: 80

In [67]: B.nbytes
Out[67]: 80000
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>First : an answer . </p>
<pre><code>import sys

try: print sys.getsizeof(object)
except AttributeError:
    print "sys.getsizeof exists in Python â‰Ľ2.6"
</code></pre>
<p>Discussion : In Python , you can not ever access " direct " memory addresses. Why , then , would you need or want to know how many such addresses are occupied by a given <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> ? ? It 's a question that 's entirely inappropriate at that level of abstraction. When you 're painting your house , you do n't ask what frequencies of light are absorbed or reflected by each of the constituent atoms within the paint , you just ask what color it is -- the details of the physical characteristics that create that color are beside the point. Similarly , the number of bytes of memory that a given Python <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> occupies is beside the point . </p>
<p>So , why are you trying to use Python to write C code ? : ) </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>This can be more complicated than it looks depending on how you want to count things. For instance , if you have a list of ints , do you want the size of the list containing the references to the ints ? ( ie. list only , not what is contained in it ) , or do you want to include the actual data pointed to , in which case you need to deal with duplicate references , and how to prevent double-counting when two <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> contain references to the same <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> . </p>
<p>You may want to take a look at one of the python memory profilers , such as pysizer to see if they meet your needs . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>One other reason why you might need the size is for setting the Content-Length property of an HttpResponse . That 's what I needed this for . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>It might be useful to see why your process eats up memory.. . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p><span style="background-color:yellow;">Besides</span> int and float , nothing is really fixed in size ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">And</span> int is now long in Python 3 , so so much for that ) . So you 'd have to make a function sizeof function that specially works on the <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> based on type ( ) or something. Either way , sizeof messes seem unpythonic </p>
