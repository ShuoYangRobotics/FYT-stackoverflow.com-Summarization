<h3>Question ( ID-2429560 ) : </h3><h2>Python for loop question </h2><p>I was wondering how to achieve the following in python : </p>
<pre><code>for( int i = 0; cond...; i++)
  if cond...
    i++; //to skip an run-through
</code></pre>
<p>I tried this with no luck . </p>
<pre><code>for i in range(whatever):
  if cond... :
    i += 1
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-7 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>There is a continue keyword which skips the current iteration and advances to the next one ( and a break keyword which skips all loop iterations and exits the loop ) : </p>
<pre><code>for i in range(10):
    if i % 2 == 0:
      # skip even numbers
      continue 
    print i
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>Python 's for loops are different. i gets reassigned to the next value every time through the loop . </p>
<p>The following will do what you want , because it is taking the literal version of what C + + is doing : </p>
<pre><code>i = 0
while i < some_value:
    if cond...:
        i+=1
    ...code...
    i+=1
</code></pre>
<p>Here 's why : </p>
<p>in C + + , the following code segments are equivalent : </p>
<pre><code>for(..a..; ..b..; ..c..) {
    ...code...
}
</code></pre>
<p>and </p>
<pre><code>..a..
while(..b..) {
     ..code..
     ..c..
}
</code></pre>
<p>whereas the python for loop looks something like : </p>
<pre><code>for x in ..a..:
    ..code..
</code></pre>
<p>turns into </p>
<pre><code>my_iter = iter(..a..)
while (my_iter is not empty):
    x = my_iter.next()
    ..code..
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>Remember that you are iterating over the elements in the list , and not iterating over a number . </p>
<p>For example consider the following : </p>
<pre><code>for i in ["cat", "dog"]:
  print i
</code></pre>
<p>What would happen if you did i + 1 there ? You can see now why it does n't skip the next element in the list . </p>
<p>Instead of actually iterating over all values , you could try to adjust what is contained inside the list you are iterating over . </p>
<p>Example : </p>
<pre><code>r = range(10)
for i in filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, r):
  print i
</code></pre>
<p>You can also consider breaking up the for body into 2. The first part will skip to the next element by using continue , and the second part will do the action if you did not skip . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>You can explicitly increment the iterator . </p>
<pre><code>whatever = iter(whatever)
for i in whatever:
    if cond:
        whatever.next()
</code></pre>
<p>You will need to catch StopIteration if cond can be True on the last element . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>There is an alternate approach to this , depending on the task you are trying to accomplish. If cond is entirely a function of the input data you are looping over , you might try something like the following : </p>
<pre><code>def check_cond(item):
    if item satisfies cond:
        return True
    return False

for item in filter(check_cond, list):
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>This is the functional programming way to do this , sort of like LINQ in C # 3.0 + . I 'm not so certain it 's all that pythonic ( for a while Guido van Rossum wanted to remove filter , map and reduce from Python 3 ) but it certainly is elegant and the way I would do it . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>You ca n't trivially " skip the next leg " ( you can of course skip this leg with a continue ) . If you really insist you can do it with an auxiliary bool , e.g . </p>
<pre><code>skipping = False
for i in whatever:
  if skipping:
    skipping = False
    continue
  skipping = cond
  ...
</code></pre>
<p>or for generality with an auxiliary int : </p>
<pre><code>skipping = 0
for i in whatever:
  if skipping:
    skipping -= 1
    continue
  if badcond:
    skipping = 5  # skip 5 legs
  ...
</code></pre>
<p>However , it would be better to encapsulate such complex looping logic in an appropriate generator -- hard to give examples unless you can be a bit more concrete about what you want though ( that " pseudo-C " with two presumably <span style="background-color:yellow;">100</span> % different uses of the same boolean cond is REALLY hard to follow ; - ) . </p>
