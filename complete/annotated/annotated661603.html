<h3>Question ( ID-661603 ) : </h3><h2>How do I know if a <span style="background-color:yellow;">generator</span> is empty from the start ? </h2><p>Is there a simple way of testing if the <span style="background-color:yellow;">generator</span> has no <span style="background-color:yellow;">items</span> , like <span style="background-color:yellow;">peek</span> , hasNext , isEmpty , something along those lines ? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-8 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>The simple answer to your question : no , there is no simple way. There are a whole lot of work-arounds . </p>
<p>There really should n't be a simple way , because of what <span style="background-color:yellow;">generators</span> are : a way to output a sequence of values without holding the sequence in memory . So there 's no backward traversal . </p>
<p>You could write a has_next function or maybe even slap it on to a <span style="background-color:yellow;">generator</span> as a method with a fancy decorator if you wanted to . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>Here is a recipe for an iterator wrapper , it probably allows to do what you want : </p>
<p>http : //code.activestate.com/recipes/502304/ </p>
<p>Note : I have not tested if it works or not . Nor am I sure that the functionality is useful . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>Suggestion : </p>
<pre><code>def peek(iterable):
    try:
        first, rest = next(iterable)
    except StopIteration:
        return None
    return first, itertools.chain([first], rest)
</code></pre>
<p>Usage : </p>
<pre><code>res = peek(mysequence)
if res is None:
    # sequence is empty.  Do stuff.
else:
    first, mysequence = res
    # Do something with first, maybe?
    # Then iterate over the sequence:
    for element in mysequence:
        # etc.
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>I hate to offer a second solution , especially one that I would not use myself , but , if you absolutely had to do this and to not consume the <span style="background-color:yellow;">generator</span> , as in other answers : </p>
<pre><code>def do_something_with_item(item):
    print item

empty_marker = object()

try:
     first_item = my_generator.next()     
except StopIteration:
     print 'The generator was empty'
     first_item = empty_marker

if first_item is not empty_marker:
    do_something_with_item(first_item)
    for item in my_generator:
        do_something_with_item(item)
</code></pre>
<p>Now I really do n't like this solution , because I believe that this is not how <span style="background-color:yellow;">generators</span> are to be used . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Sorry for the obvious approach , but the best way would be to do : </p>
<pre><code>for item in my_generator:
     print item
</code></pre>
<p>Now you have detected that the <span style="background-color:yellow;">generator</span> is empty while you are using it. Of course , <span style="background-color:yellow;">item</span> will never be displayed if the <span style="background-color:yellow;">generator</span> is empty . </p>
<p>This may not exactly fit in with your code , but this is what the idiom of the <span style="background-color:yellow;">generator</span> is for : iterating , so perhaps you might change your approach slightly , or not use <span style="background-color:yellow;">generators</span> at all . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>The best approach , IMHO , would be to avoid a special test. Most times , use of a <span style="background-color:yellow;">generator</span> is the test : </p>
<pre><code>thing_generated = False

# Nothing is lost here. if nothing is generated, 
# the for block is not executed. Often, that's the only check
# you need to do
for thing in my_generator():
    thing_generated = True
    print "I've generated something!"
</code></pre>
<p>If that 's not good enough , you can still perform an explicit test. At this point , thing will contain the last value <span style="background-color:yellow;">generated.</span> If nothing was <span style="background-color:yellow;">generated</span> , it will be undefined - unless you 've already defined the variable. You could check the value of thing , but that 's a bit unreliable. Instead , just set a flag within the block and check it afterward : </p>
<pre><code>if not thing_generated:
    print "Avast, ye scurvy dog!"
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><pre><code>>>> gen = (i for i in [])
>>> next(gen)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<pyshell#43>", line 1, in <module>
    next(gen)
StopIteration
</code></pre>
<p>At the end of <span style="background-color:yellow;">generator</span> StopIteration is raised , since in your case end is reached immediately , exception is raised. But normally you should n't check for existence of next value . </p>
<p>another thing you can do is : </p>
<pre><code>>>> gen = (i for i in [])
>>> if not list(gen):
    print('empty generator')
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>If you need to know before you use the <span style="background-color:yellow;">generator</span> , then no , there is no simple way. If you can wait until after you have used the <span style="background-color:yellow;">generator</span> , there is a simple way : </p>
<pre><code>was_empty = True

for some_item in some_generator:
    was_empty = False
    do_something_with(some_item)

if was_empty:
    handle_already_empty_generator_case()
</code></pre>
