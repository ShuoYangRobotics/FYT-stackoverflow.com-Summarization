<h3>Question ( ID-3875596 ) : </h3><h2>equivalent of Python 's " <span style="background-color:yellow;">with</span> " in Ruby </h2><p>In Python , the <span style="background-color:yellow;">with</span> statement is used to make sure that clean-up code always gets called , regardless of exceptions being thrown or function calls returning. For example : </p>
<pre><code>with open("temp.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("hi")
    raise ValueError("spitespite")
</code></pre>
<p>Here , the file is closed , even though an exception was raised. A better explanation is here . </p>
<p>Is there an equivalent for this construct in Ruby ? Or can you code one up , since Ruby has continuations ? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-6 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>Ruby has syntactically lightweight support for literal anonymous procedures ( called blocks in Ruby ) . Therefore , it does n't need a new language feature for this . </p>
<p>( In general , it is a bad sign , if you need to add language features. You should be able to implement everything in a library , otherwise it is a sign of bad language design. ) </p>
<p>So , what you normally do , is to write a method which takes a block of code , allocates the resource , executes the block of code in the context of that resource and then closes the resource . </p>
<p>Something like this : </p>
<pre><code>def with(klass, *args)
  yield r = klass.open(*args)
ensure
  r.close
end
</code></pre>
<p>You could use it like this : </p>
<pre><code>with File, 'temp.txt', 'w' do |f|
  f.write 'hi'
  raise 'spitespite'
end
</code></pre>
<p>However , this is a very procedural way to do this. Ruby is an <span style="background-color:yellow;">object-oriented</span> language , which means that the responsibility of properly executing a block of code in the context of a <span style="background-color:yellow;">File</span> should belong to the <span style="background-color:yellow;">File</span> class : </p>
<pre><code>File.open 'temp.txt', 'w' do |f|
  f.write 'hi'
  raise 'spitespite'
end
</code></pre>
<p>This could be implemented something like this : </p>
<pre><code>def File.open(*args)
  f = new(*args)
  return f unless block_given?
  yield f
ensure
  f.close if block_given?
end
</code></pre>
<p>This is a general pattern that is implemented by lots of classes in the Ruby core library , standard libraries and third-party libraries . </p>
<hr />
<p>A more close correspondence to the generic Python context manager protocol would be : </p>
<pre><code>def with(ctx)
  yield ctx.setup
ensure
  ctx.teardown
end

class File
  def setup; self end
  alias_method :teardown, :close
end

with File.open('temp.txt', 'w') do |f|
  f.write 'hi'
  raise 'spitespite'
end
</code></pre>
<p>Note that this is virtually indistinguishable from the Python example , but it did n't require the addition of new syntax to the language . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>The equivalent in Ruby would be to pass a block to the <span style="background-color:yellow;">File.open</span> method . </p>
<pre><code>File.open(...) do |file|
  #do stuff with file
end  #file is closed
</code></pre>
<p>This is the idiom that Ruby uses and one that you should get comfortable <span style="background-color:yellow;">with</span> . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>You could use Block Arguments to do this in Ruby : </p>
<pre><code>class Object  
    def with(obj)  
        obj.__enter__  
        yield  
        obj.__exit__  
    end  
end
</code></pre>
<p>Now , you could add <span style="background-color:yellow;">__enter__</span> and <span style="background-color:yellow;">__exit__</span> methods to another class and use it like this : </p>
<pre><code>with GetSomeObject("somefile.text") do |foo|  
    do_something_with(foo)
end  
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>You could always use a try..catch..finally block , where the finally section contains code to clean up . </p>
<p>Edit : sorry , misspoke : you 'd want begin..rescue..ensure . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>I believe you are looking for ensure . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>I 'll just add some more explanations for others ; credit should go to them . </p>
<p>Indeed , in Ruby , clean-up code is as others said , in ensure clause ; but wrapping things in blocks is ubiquitous in Ruby , and this is how it is done most efficiently and most in spirit of Ruby. When translating , do n't translate directly word-for-word , you will get some very strange sentences. Similarly , do n't expect everything from Python to have one-to-one correspondence to Ruby . </p>
<p>From the link you posted : </p>
<pre><code>class controlled_execution:
    def __enter__(self):
        set things up
        return thing
    def __exit__(self, type, value, traceback):
        tear things down

with controlled_execution() as thing:
     some code
</code></pre>
<p>Ruby way , something like this ( man , I 'm probably doing this all wrong : D ) : </p>
<pre><code>def controlled_executor
  begin
    do_setup
    yield
  ensure
    do_cleanup
  end
end

controlled_executor do ...
  some_code
end
</code></pre>
<p>Obviously , you can add arguments to both controlled executor ( to be called in a usual fashion ) , and to yield ( in which case you need to add arguments to the block as well ) . Thus , to implement what you quoted above, </p>
<pre><code>class File
  def my_open(file, mode="r")
    handle = open(file, mode)
    begin
      yield handle
    ensure
      handle.close
    end
  end
end

File.my_open("temp.txt", "w") do |f|
  f.write("hi")
  raise Exception.new("spitesprite")
end
</code></pre>
