<h3>Question ( ID-2429692 ) : </h3><h2>What is the purpose of a zip function ( as in Python or C # 4.0 ) ? </h2><p></p>
<p>...which leads me to ask , what good is zip ? In what scenarios do I need this ? Is it really so foundational that I need this in the base class library ? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-7 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>zip is useful if you 'd like to iterate over multiple iterables simultaneously , which is a reasonably common scenario in Python . </p>
<p>One real-world scenario where zip has come in handy for me is if you have an M by N array , and you want to look at columns instead of rows. For example : </p>
<pre><code>>>> five_by_two = ((0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5))
>>> two_by_five = tuple(zip(*five_by_two))
>>> two_by_five
((0, 1, 2, 3, 4), (1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>It allows you to process sequences in parallel instead of sequentially or nested. There 's... so many uses for it that they currently escape me . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>Here 's a common use case for zip : </p>
<pre><code>x = [1,2,3,4,5]
y = [6,7,8,9,0]

for x,y in zip(x,y):
    print x+y
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>It 's handy in different places. My favorite , from http : //norvig.com/python-iaq.html , is transposing a matrix : </p>
<pre><code>>>> x = [ [1,2,3,4,5],[6,7,8,9,10],[11,12,13,14,15]]
>>> zip(*x)
[(1, 6, 11), (2, 7, 12), (3, 8, 13), (4, 9, 14), (5, 10, 15)]
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Someone actually asked a question here fairly recently that I answered with the Zip extension method , so it 's obviously important for some people. ; ) </p>
<p>Actually , it is a fairly important operation for mathematical algorithms - matrices , curve fitting , interpolation , pattern recognition , that sort of thing. Also very important in engineering applications like digital signal processing where much of what you do is combine multiple signals or apply linear transforms to them - both are based on the sample index , hence , zip it. Zipping two sequences is far , far faster than sorting and joining them based on some key , especially when you know in advance that the sequences have the same number of elements and are in the same order . </p>
<p>I ca n't get into tight specifics here on account of my current employment , but speaking generally , this is also valuable for telemetry data - industrial , scientific , that sort of thing. Often you 'll have time sequences of data coming from hundreds or thousands of points - parallel sources - and you need to aggregate , but horizontally , over devices , not over time. At the end , you want another time sequence , but with the sum or average or some <span style="background-color:yellow;">other</span> aggregate of all the individual points . </p>
<p>It may sound like a simple sort/group/join in SQL Server ( for example ) but it 's actually really hard to do efficiently this way. For one thing , the timestamps may not match exactly , but you do n't care about differences of a few milliseconds , so you end up having to generate a surrogate key/row number and group on that - and of course , the surrogate row number is nothing more than the time index which you already had . Zipping is simple , fast , and infinitely parallelizable . </p>
<p>I do n't know if I 'd call it foundational , but it it is important . I do n't use the Reverse method very often either , but by the same token I 'm glad I do n't have to keep writing it myself on those rare occasions when I do find a need for it . </p>
<p>One of the reasons it might not seem that useful to you now is that .NET/C # 3.5 does not have tuples. C # 4 does have tuples , and when you 're working with tuples , zipping really is a fundamental operation because ordering is strictly enforced . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>A use case : </p>
<pre><code>>>> fields = ["id", "name", "location"]
>>> values = ["13", "bill", "redmond"]
>>> dict(zip(fields, values))
{'location': 'redmond', 'id': '13', 'name': 'bill'}
</code></pre>
<p>Try doing this without zip.. . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>Here 's a case where I used zip ( ) to useful effect , in a Python class for <span style="background-color:yellow;">comparing</span> version numbers : </p>
<pre><code>class Version(object):

    # ... snip ...

    def get_tuple(self):
        return (self.major, self.minor, self.revision)

    def compare(self, other):
        def comp(a, b):
            if a == '*' or b == '*':
                return 0
            elif a == b:
                return 0
            elif a < b:
                return -1
            else:
                return 1
        return tuple(comp(a, b) for a, b in zip(self.get_tuple(), Version(other).get_tuple()))

    def is_compatible(self, other):
        tup = self.compare(other)
        return (tup[0] == 0 and tup[1] == 0)

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return all(x == 0 for x in self.compare(other))

    def __ne__(self, other):
        return any(x != 0 for x in self.compare(other))

    def __lt__(self, other):
        for x in self.compare(other):
            if x < 0:
                return True
            elif x > 0:
                return False
        return False

    def __gt__(self, other):
        for x in self.compare(other):
            if x > 0:
                return True
            elif x < 0:
                return False
        return False

<p>I think zip ( ) , coupled with all ( ) and any ( ) , makes the <span style="background-color:yellow;">comparison</span> operator implementations particularly clear and elegant. Sure , it could have been done without zip ( ) , but then the same could be said about practically any language feature . </p>
