<h3>Question ( ID-138552 ) : </h3><h2>Can Regex be used for this particular string manipulation ? </h2><p>I need to <span style="background-color:yellow;">replace</span> character ( say ) x with character ( say ) P in a string , but only if it is contained in a quoted <span style="background-color:yellow;">substring</span> . An example makes it clearer : </p>
<pre><code>axbx'cxdxe'fxgh'ixj'k  -> axbx'cPdPe'fxgh'iPj'k
</code></pre>
<p>Let 's assume , for the sake of simplicity , that quotes always come in pairs . </p>
<p>The obvious way is to just process the string one character at a time ( a simple state machine approach ) ; however , I 'm wondering if <span style="background-color:yellow;">regular</span> expressions can be used to do all the processing in one go . </p>
<p>My target language is C # , but I guess my question pertains to any language having builtin or library support for <span style="background-color:yellow;">regular</span> expressions . </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-9 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>I was able to do this with Python : </p>
<pre><code>>>> import re
>>> re.sub(r"x(?=[^']*'([^']|'[^']*')*$)", "P", "axbx'cxdxe'fxgh'ixj'k")
"axbx'cPdPe'fxgh'iPj'k"
</code></pre>
<p>What this does is use the non-capturing match ( ? = ... ) to check that the character x is within a quoted string. It looks for some nonquote characters up to the next quote , then looks for a sequence of either single characters or quoted groups of characters , until the end of the string . </p>
<p>This <span style="background-color:yellow;">relies</span> on your assumption that the quotes are always balanced. This is also not very efficient . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>I converted Greg Hewgill 's python code to C # and it worked ! </p>
<pre><code>[Test]
public void ReplaceTextInQuotes()
{
  Assert.AreEqual("axbx'cPdPe'fxgh'iPj'k", 
    Regex.Replace("axbx'cxdxe'fxgh'ixj'k",
      @"x(?=[^']*'([^']|'[^']*')*$)", "P"));
}
</code></pre>
<p>That test passed . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>Not with plain <span style="background-color:yellow;">regexp.</span> Regular expressions have no " memory " so they can not distinguish between being " inside " or " outside " quotes . </p>
<p>You need something more powerful , for example using gema it would be straighforward : </p>
<pre><code>'<repl>'=$0
repl:x=P
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>The trick is to use non-capturing group to match the part of the string following the match ( character x ) we are searching for . Trying to match the string up to x will only find either the first or the last occurence , depending whether non-greedy quantifiers are used . Here 's Greg 's idea transposed to Tcl , with comments . </p>
<pre>
set strIn {axbx'cxdxe'fxgh'ixj'k}
set regex {(?x)                     # enable expanded syntax 
                                    # - allows comments, ignores whitespace
            x                       # the actual match
            (?=                     # non-matching group
                [^']*'              # match to end of current quoted substring
                                    ##
                                    ## assuming quotes are in pairs,
                                    ## make sure we actually were 
                                    ## inside a quoted substring
                                    ## by making sure the rest of the string 
                                    ## is what we expect it to be
                                    ##
                (
                    [^']*           # match any non-quoted substring
                    |               # ...or...
                    '[^']*'         # any quoted substring, including the quotes
                )*                  # any number of times
                $                   # until we run out of string :)
            )                       # end of non-matching group
}

#the same regular expression without the comments
set regexCondensed {(?x)x(?=[^']*'([^']|'[^']*')*$)}

set replRegex {P}
set nMatches [regsub -all -- $regex $strIn $replRegex strOut]
puts "$nMatches replacements. "
if {$nMatches > 0} {
    puts "Original: |$strIn|"
    puts "Result:   |$strOut|"
}
exit
</pre>
<p>This prints : </p>
<pre><code>3 replacements. 
Original: |axbx'cxdxe'fxgh'ixj'k|
Result:   |axbx'cPdPe'fxgh'iPj'k|

<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>A more general ( and simpler ) solution which allows non-paired quotes . </p>
<ol>Find quoted string Replace 'x ' by 'P ' in the string # ! /usr/bin/env python import <span style="background-color:yellow;">re</span> text = " axbx'cxdxe'fxgh'ixj'k " s = <span style="background-color:yellow;">re.sub</span> ( " '. * ?

<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>Sorry to break your hopes , but you need a push-down automata to do that. There is more info here : Pushdown Automaton </p>
<p>In short , Regular expressions , which are finite state machines can only <span style="background-color:yellow;">read</span> and has no memory while pushdown automaton has a stack and manipulating capabilities . </p>

<p>Although you can try this in Vim , but it works well only if the string is on one line , and there 's only one pair of 's . </p>
<pre><code>:%s:\('[^']*\)x\([^']*'\):\1P\2:gci
</code></pre>
<p>If there 's one more pair or even an unbalanced ' , then it could fail. That 's way I included the c a.k.a. confirm flag on the ex command . </p>
<p>The same can be done with sed , without the interaction - or with awk so you can add some interaction . </p>
<p>One possible solution is to break the lines on pairs of ' s then you can do with vim solution . </p>
