<h3>Question ( ID-35988 ) : </h3><h2>C-like structures in Python </h2><p>Is there a way to conveniently define a C-like structure in Python ? I 'm tired of writing stuff like : </p>
<pre><code>class MyStruct():
    def __init__(self, field1, field2, field3)
        self.field1 = field1
        self.field2 = field2
        self.field3 = field3
</code></pre>
<p>( Interesting , it appears I ca n't type underscores following non-whitespace in pre-formatted text blocks ) </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-9 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>You can use a tuple for a lot of things where you would use a struct in C ( something like x,y coordinates or RGB colors for example ) . </p>
<p>For everything else you can use dictionary , or a utility class like this one : </p>
<pre><code>>>> class Bunch:
...     def __init__(self, **kwds):
...         self.__dict__.update(kwds)
...
>>> mystruct = Bunch(field1=value1, field2=value2)
</code></pre>
<p>I think the " definitive " discussion is here , in the published version of the Python Cookbook . </p>
<br /><b># <span style="background-color:yellow;">1</span> </b><br /><p>For a " whole " solution , see Raymond Hettinger 's named tuple recipe. It 's nice for your basic example , but also covers a bunch of edge cases you might run into later as well. Your fragment above would be written as : </p>
<pre><code>from collections import namedtuple
MyStruct = namedtuple("MyStruct", "field1 field2 field3")
</code></pre>
<p>Named tuple is part of <span style="background-color:yellow;">collections</span> module in standard library since Python <span style="background-color:yellow;">2.6</span> . </p>
<br /><b># <span style="background-color:yellow;">2</span> </b><br /><p>How about a dictionary ? </p>
<p>Something like this : </p>
<pre><code>myStruct = {'field1': 'some val', 'field2': 'some val'}
</code></pre>
<p>Then you can use this to manipulate values : </p>
<pre><code>print myStruct['field1']
myStruct['field2'] = 'some other values'
</code></pre>
<p>And the values do n't have to be strings. They can be pretty much any other object . </p>
<br /><b># <span style="background-color:yellow;">3</span> </b><br /><blockquote>dF : that 's pretty cool... I did n't know that I could access the fields in a class using dict . Mark : the situations that I wish I had this are precisely when I want a tuple but nothing as " heavy " as a dictionary . </blockquote>
<p>You can access the fields of a class using a dictionary because the fields of a class , its methods and all its properties are stored internally using dicts ( at least in Cython ) . </p>
<p>...Which leads us to your second comment. Believing that Python dicts are " heavy " is an extremely non-pythonistic concept. And reading such comments kills my Python Zen. That 's not good . </p>
<p>You see , when you declare a class you are actually creating a pretty complex wrapper around a dictionary - so , if anything , you are adding more overhead than by using a simple dictionary. An overhead which , by the way , is meaningless in any case. If you are working on performance critical applications , use C or something . </p>
<br /><b># <span style="background-color:yellow;">4</span> </b><br /><p>You can also pass the init parameters to the instance variables by position </p>
<pre><code># Abstract struct class       
class Struct:
    def __init__ (self, *argv, **argd):
        if len(argd):
            # Update by dictionary
            self.__dict__.update (argd)
        else:
            # Update by position
            attrs = filter (lambda x: x[0:2] != "__", dir(self))
            for n in range(len(argv)):
                setattr(self, attrs[n], argv[n])

# Specific class
class Point3dStruct (Struct):
    x = 0
    y = 0
    z = 0

pt1 = Point3dStruct()
pt1.x = 10

print pt1.x
print "-"*10

pt2 = Point3dStruct(5, 6)

print pt2.x, pt2.y
print "-"*10

pt3 = Point3dStruct (x=1, y=2, z=3)
print pt3.x, pt3.y, pt3.z
print "-"*10
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>Perhaps you are looking for <span style="background-color:yellow;">Structs</span> without constructors : </p>
<pre><code>class Sample:
  name = ''
  average = 0.0
  values = None # list cannot be initialized here!


s1 = Sample()
s1.name = "sample 1"
s1.values = []
s1.values.append(1)
s1.values.append(2)
s1.values.append(3)

s2 = Sample()
s2.name = "sample 2"
s2.values = []
s2.values.append(4)

for v in s1.values:   # prints 1,2,3 --> OK.
  print v
print "***"
for v in s2.values:   # prints 4 --> OK.
  print v

<p>Yep , there was just a question about that . </p>
<p>As far as your question goes , why exactly do you want to use a <span style="background-color:yellow;">Struct</span> in Python ? What are you trying to do ? Is there a more 'Pythonic ' way of doing it ? </p>
<p>Edited to add : It looks like Mark posted a more 'Pythonic ' approach while I was writing this </p>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>I 'm having the same problem recently. I 've found this thing , hope it helps = ) </p>
<p>http : //docs.python.org/library/ctypes.html ? highlight = ctypes # structures-and-unions </p>
<br /><b># 8 </b><br /><p>I thought that python directories did n't have a specified or fixed order . So the line : </p>
<p>attrs = filter ( lambda x : x [ 0 : <span style="background-color:yellow;">2</span> ] ! = " __ " , dir ( self ) ) </p>
<p>only works by luck and might break at any time. The class variables might be returned in a different order then the order they were declared in and/or different orders at different times . </p>
