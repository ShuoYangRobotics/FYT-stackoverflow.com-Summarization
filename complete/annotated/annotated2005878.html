<h3>Question ( ID-2005878 ) : </h3><h2>What are Python metaclasses useful for ? </h2><p>What can be done with metaclasses that ca n't be in any other way ? </p>
<p>Alex Martelli told that there are tasks that ca n't be achieved without metaclasses here http : //stackoverflow.com/questions/1779372/python-metaclasses-vs-class-decorators I 'd like to know which are ? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-8 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>Metaclasses are indispensable if you want to have class <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> ( as opposed to instances of class <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> ) equipped with " special customized behavior " , since an <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> 's behavior depends on special methods on the <span style="background-color:yellow;">type</span> of the <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> , and a class <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> 's <span style="background-color:yellow;">type</span> is , exactly a synonym for , the metaclass . </p>
<p>For example , if you want a class <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> X such that " print X " emits " Time is now 8 : 46am " ( at 8 : 46 am , or , more generally , the current time ) this must mean that <span style="background-color:yellow;">type</span> ( x ) ( AKA X 's metaclass ) has a special custom __str__ method -- and similarly ( with the various applicable special-methods ) if you want to give meaning to expressions such as X + Y where X and Y are both class <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> , or X [ 23 ] ( where X , again , is a class <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> ) , and so forth . </p>
<p>Most other customization tasks are now ( in Python 2.6 or better ) easier to implement with a class decorator , which can alter a class <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> right after the end of the class statement. There are a few more cases where this is not feasible because the alterations must be made very early on if they are to have any effect ( e.g. , setting or altering __slots__ ) . </p>
<p>In Python 3 , metaclasses gain one extra little bit of usefulness : a metaclass can now optionally specify the mapping <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> to be populated during the execution of the class statement 's body ( by default , it 's a normal dict ) . This allows the order of name bindings in the class body to be preserved and used ( while the normal dict loses order ) , which is sometimes nice when the class must have " fields " in a certain specific order ( e.g. to map 1 : 1 onto a C struct , a row in a CSV file or DB table , and the like ) -- in Python 2. * this had to be redundantly specified ( typically with an extra class attribute that 's a sequence and thus does preserve order ) , and this feature of Python 3 metaclasses allows the redundancy to be removed . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>Add extra flexibility to your programming : </p>
<p>But according to this Metaclass programming in Python you might not need them ( yet ) </p>
<blockquote>Metaclasses are deeper magic than 99 % of users should ever worry about. If you wonder whether you need them , you do n't ( the people who actually need them know with certainty that they need them , and do n't need an explanation about why ) . -- Python Guru Tim Peters </blockquote>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>If you are looking for examples of using the metaclass mechanism , you can read the source code of django.forms . </p>
<p>The declarative style of form definition is implemented through metaclass . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>I use metaclasses with some frequency , and they 're an extremely powerful tool to have in the toolbox. Sometimes your solution to a problem can be more elegant , less code , with them than without . </p>
<p>The thing I find myself using metaclasses for most often , is post-processing the class attributes during class creation. For example , setting a name attribute on <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> where appropriate ( like how the Django ORM might work ) : </p>
<pre><code>class AutonamingType(type):
    def __init__(cls, name, bases, attrs):
        for k,v in attrs.iteritems():
            if getattr(v, '__autoname__', False):
                v.name = k

class Autonamer(object):
    __metaclass__ = AutonamingType
</code></pre>
<p>If you have this as a tool , and you 're using a class which must know its name before it can <span style="background-color:yellow;">do_something</span> ( ) : </p>
<pre><code>class Foo(object):
    __autoname__ = True
    def __init__(self, name=None):
        self.name = name
    def do_something(self):
        if self.name is None:
            raise ValueError('name is None')
        # now, do something
</code></pre>
<p>It can make the difference in the rest of your code between this : </p>
<pre><code>class Bar(object):
    myfoo1 = Foo('myfoo1')
    myfoo2 = Foo('myfoo2')
    myfoo3 = Foo('myfoo3')
</code></pre>
<p>and this : </p>
<pre><code>class Baaz(Autonamer):
    myfoo1 = Foo()
    myfoo2 = Foo()
    myfoo3 = Foo()
</code></pre>
<p>Thus reducing duplication ( and the chances that the variable name and the assigned name might get out-of-sync ) . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>They are rarely needed , but come in useful in places where you want to add behavior to the basic behavior of an <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> -- compare Aspect Oriented Programming , or the instrumentation done in persistence frameworks like Hibernate . </p>
<p>For example , you may want a class which persists or logs each new <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>Probably there is nothing that can be done exclusively with metaclasses , but to some people ( mine included ) it 's a interesting tool you can use. Just be careful not to abuse , as it can be tricky . </p>
<p>For example , I 've used metaprogramming in a recent project. It was a OpenOffice calc sheet , which , using some pyUNO macros , generates some files with information. There was one sheet that presents to the user the information to fill , and the others can be used to describe the kind of elements and their properties. The user can then select the number of elements and the <span style="background-color:yellow;">type</span> of each , and generate the files . The macro will create a class via metaprogramming following the configuration on each sheet. Then , the user can instanciate each class and generate <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> . </p>
<p>It could be done without metaprogramming , but to me seemed natural to use the metaprogramming capabilities to do it . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>Take a look at Django sources - for example metaclasses are used there to generate models . </p>
<p>http : //code.djangoproject.com/wiki/DynamicModels </p>
<blockquote>Internally , Django uses metaclasses to create models based on a class you provide in your source code. Without getting into too many details , that means that rather than your classes being the actual models , Django receives a description of your class , which it uses to create a model in its place . </blockquote>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>I think it is n't that there are n't other ways to do it , but some things are just nicer with metaclasses . </p>
