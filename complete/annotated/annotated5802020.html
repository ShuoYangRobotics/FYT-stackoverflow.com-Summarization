<h3>Question ( ID-5802020 ) : </h3><h2>Overloading + to support <span style="background-color:yellow;">tuples</span> </h2><p>I 'd like to be able to write something like this in python : </p>
<pre><code>a = (1, 2)
b = (3, 4)
c = a + b # c would be (4, 6)
d = 3 * b # d would be (9, 12)
</code></pre>
<p>I realize that you can overload operators to work with custom classes , but is there a way to overload operators to work with pairs ? </p>
<p>Of course , such solutions as </p>
<pre><code>c = tuple([x+y for x, y in zip(a, b)])
</code></pre>
<p>do work , but , let aside performance , they are n't quite as pretty as overloading the + operator . </p>
<p>One can of course define <span style="background-color:yellow;">add</span> and <span style="background-color:yellow;">mul</span> functions such as </p>
<pre><code>def add((x1, y1), (x2, y2)):
    return (x1 + x2, y1 + y2)

def mul(a, (x, y)):
    return (a * x, a * y)
</code></pre>
<p>but still being able to write q * b + r instead of <span style="background-color:yellow;">add</span> ( times ( q , b ) , r ) would be nicer . </p>
<p>Ideas ? </p>
<p>EDIT : On a side note , I realize that since + currently maps to <span style="background-color:yellow;">tuple</span> concatenation , it might be unwise to redefine it , even if it 's possible. <span style="background-color:yellow;">The</span> question still holds for - for example = ) </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">Total-7</span> ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>In contrast to Ruby , you ca n't change the behaviour of built-in types in Python. All you can do is create a new type derived from a built-in type. Literals will still create the built-in type , though . </p>
<p>Probably the best you can get is </p>
<pre><code>class T(tuple):
    def __add__(self, other):
        return T(x + y for x, y in zip(self, other))
    def __rmul__(self, other):
        return T(other * x for x in self)
a = T((1, 2))
b = T((3, 4))
c = a + b # c would be (4, 6)
d = 3 * b # d would be (9, 12)
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>You can not modify types defined in C , so you would need to create all new types for this. Or you could just use NumPy , which already has types that support this . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>You can inherit a class from <span style="background-color:yellow;">tuple</span> and overload its <span style="background-color:yellow;">__add__</span> method. Here 's a very simplistic example : </p>
<pre><code>class mytuple(tuple):
    def __add__(self, other):
        assert len(self) == len(other)
        return tuple([x + y for x, y in zip(self, other)])

mt = mytuple((5, 6))
print mt + (2, 3)  # prints (7, 9)
</code></pre>
<p>I would n't recommend this approach though , because <span style="background-color:yellow;">tuples</span> were n't really designed for this purpose. If you want to perform numeric computations , just use numpy . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>Using python complex numbers is definitely one way to do it , if not extremely pretty . </p>
<pre><code>a = 1 + 2j
b = 3 + 4j
c = a + b # c would be 4 + 6j
d = 3 * b # d would be 9 + 12j
</code></pre>
<p><span style="background-color:yellow;">That</span> saves the definition of an extra class . </p>
<p>Also , expanding on previous answers, </p>
<pre><code>class T(tuple):
    def __add__((x, y), (x1, y1)):
        return T((x+x1, y+y1))
    def __rmul__((x, y), other):
        return T((other * x, other * y))
</code></pre>
<p>would improve performance , at the cost of restraining the implementation to pairs . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Write your own class and implement __mul__ , <span style="background-color:yellow;">__add__</span> etc . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>You can use numpy.array to get all you need . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p><span style="background-color:yellow;">There</span> is the famous infix operator hack that would allow you to do soemthing like this : </p>
<pre><code>x = Infix(lambda a,b:tuple([x+y for x, y in zip(a, b)]))
y = Infix(lambda a,b:tuple([a*y for y in b]))

c = a |x| b # c would be (4, 6)
d = 3 |y| b # d would be (9, 12) 
</code></pre>
<p><span style="background-color:yellow;">That</span> would hide the generator expressions and be applicable to <span style="background-color:yellow;">tuples</span> of all lengths , at the expense of " weird " pseudo-operators | x | and | y | . </p>
