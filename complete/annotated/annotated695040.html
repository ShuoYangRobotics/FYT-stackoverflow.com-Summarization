<h3>Question ( ID-695040 ) : </h3><h2>Help with Python loop weirdness ? </h2><p>I 'm learning Python as my <span style="background-color:yellow;">second</span> programming language ( my first real one if you do n't count HTML/CSS/Javascript ) . I 'm trying to build <span style="background-color:yellow;">something</span> useful as my first real application - an IRC bot that alerts people via SMS when certain things happen in the channel. Per a request by <span style="background-color:yellow;">someone</span> , I 'm ( trying ) to build in <span style="background-color:yellow;">scheduling</span> preferences where people can choose not to get alerts from between <span style="background-color:yellow;">hours</span> X and Y of the day . </p>
<p>Anyways , here 's the code I 'm having trouble with : </p>
<pre><code>db = open("db.csv")
for line in db:
            row = line.split(",")  # storing stuff in a CSV, reading out of it 
            recipient = row[0]     # who the SMS is going to
            s = row[1]             # gets the first hour of the "no alert" time range
            f = row[2]             # gets last hour of above
            nrt = []               # empty array that will store hours
            curtime = time.strftime("%H")  # current hour
            if s == "no":          
                    print "They always want alerts, sending email"  # start time will = "no" if they always want alerts
                    # send mail code goes here
            else:
                    for hour in range(int(s), int(f)): #takes start, end hours, loops through to get hours in between, stores them in the above list 
                            nrt.append(hour)
                    if curtime in nrt: # best way I could find of doing this, probably a better way, like I said I'm new
                            print "They don't want an alert during the current hour, not sending"  # <== what it says
                    else:
                            # they do want an alert during the current hour, send an email
                            # send mail code here
</code></pre>
<p>The only problem I 'm having is <span style="background-color:yellow;">somehow</span> the <span style="background-color:yellow;">script</span> only ends up looping through one of the lines ( or <span style="background-color:yellow;">something</span> like that ) because I only get one result every time , even if I have more than one entry in the CSV file . </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-6 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>If this is a regular CSV file you <span style="background-color:yellow;">should</span> not try to parse it yourself. Use the <span style="background-color:yellow;">standard</span> library <span style="background-color:yellow;">csv</span> module . </p>
<p>Here is a <span style="background-color:yellow;">short</span> example from the docs : </p>
<pre><code>import csv
reader = csv.reader(open("some.csv", "rb"))
for row in reader:
    print row
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>There are at least two bugs in your program : </p>
<pre><code>curtime = time.strftime("%H")
...
for hour in range(int(s), int(f)):
    nrt.append(hour)
# this is an inefficient synonym for
# nrt = range(int(s), int(f))

if curtime in nrt:
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>First , curtime is a <span style="background-color:yellow;">string</span> , whereas nrt is a list of <span style="background-color:yellow;">integers.</span> Python is <span style="background-color:yellow;">strongly</span> typed , <span style="background-color:yellow;">so</span> the two are not <span style="background-color:yellow;">interchangeable</span> , and wo n't compare equal : </p>
<pre><code>'4' == 4 # False
'4' in [3, 4, 5] # False
</code></pre>
<p>This revised code addresses that issue , and is also more efficient than generating a list and <span style="background-color:yellow;">searching</span> for the current <span style="background-color:yellow;">hour</span> in it : </p>
<pre><code>cur_hour = time.localtime().tm_hour
if int(s) <= cur_hour < int(f):
    # You can "chain" comparison operators in Python
    # so that a op1 b op2 c is equivalent to a op1 b and b op2c
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>A <span style="background-color:yellow;">second</span> issue that the above does not address is that your program will not behave properly if the <span style="background-color:yellow;">hours</span> wrap around midnight ( e.g. <span style="background-color:yellow;">s</span> = 22 and f = 8 ) . </p>
<p>Neither of these problems are necessarily related to " the <span style="background-color:yellow;">script</span> only ends up looping through one of the lines " , but you have n't given us enough information to figure out why that might be. A more useful way to ask questions is to post a brief but complete code <span style="background-color:yellow;">snippet</span> that <span style="background-color:yellow;">shows</span> the behavior you are observing , along with <span style="background-color:yellow;">sample</span> input and the resulting error messages , if any ( along with traceback ) . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>Have you tried <span style="background-color:yellow;">something</span> more <span style="background-color:yellow;">simple</span> ? Just to <span style="background-color:yellow;">see</span> how your file is actually read by Python : </p>
<pre><code>db = open("db.csv")  
for line in db:  
    print line
</code></pre>
<p>There can be problem with format of your <span style="background-color:yellow;">csv-file.</span> That happens , for instance , when you open Unix file in Windows environment. In that case the whole file looks like <span style="background-color:yellow;">single</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">string</span> as Windows and Unix have different line <span style="background-color:yellow;">separators.</span> So , I do n't know certain cause of your problem , but offer to think in that direction . </p>
<p>Update : Your have multiple ways through the body of your loop : </p>
<ol>when <span style="background-color:yellow;">s</span> is " no " : " They always want alerts , <span style="background-color:yellow;">sending</span> email " will be printed . when <span style="background-color:yellow;">s</span> is not " no " and curtime in nrt : " They do n't want an alert during the current <span style="background-color:yellow;">hour</span> , not <span style="background-color:yellow;">sending</span> " will be printed . when <span style="background-color:yellow;">s</span> is not " no " and curtime in nrt is false ( the last else ) : nothing will be printed and no other action undertaken . </ol>
<p>Should n't you place <span style="background-color:yellow;">some</span> print <span style="background-color:yellow;">statement</span> in the last else branch ? </p>
<p>Also , what is exact output of your <span style="background-color:yellow;">snippet</span> ? Is it " They always want alerts , <span style="background-color:yellow;">sending</span> email " ? </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>I would check the logic in your conditionals. You looping construct <span style="background-color:yellow;">should</span> work . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Be explicit with what 's in a row. Using 0 , 1 , 2...n is actually your bug , and it makes code very hard to read in the future for yourself or others. So let 's use the handy tuple to <span style="background-color:yellow;">show</span> what we 're expecting from a row. This <span style="background-color:yellow;">sort</span> of works like code as documentation </p>
<pre><code>db = open("db.csv")
for line in db.readlines():
    recipient, start_hour, end_hour = line.split(",")
    nrt = []
    etc...
</code></pre>
<p>This <span style="background-color:yellow;">shows</span> the reader of your code what you 're expecting a line to contain , and it would have <span style="background-color:yellow;">shown</span> your bug to you the first time you ran it : ) </p>
