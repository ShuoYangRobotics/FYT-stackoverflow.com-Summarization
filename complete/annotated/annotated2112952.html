<h3>Question ( ID-2112952 ) : </h3><h2>Python Program converted <span style="background-color:yellow;">into</span> Java </h2><p>Sooo I started taking my second computer science class ever ! For my first class we used python and for this class we 're using Java. Our first assignment ( pretty much just practice ) is to convert this craps program from Python to Java and I 'm just having a hell of a time . </p>
<p>Could someone please help with what I 've done and umm give me some advice ? Maybe a good site for a beginner.... Someone that kinda knows Python ( only from a first CS course perspective ) . </p>
<p>1 ) In python </p>
<pre><code>def winCraps():
roll = rollDice()
if roll == 7 or roll == 11:
    return True
elif roll == 2 or roll == 3 or roll == 12:
    return False
else:
    return rollForPoint(roll)
</code></pre>
<p>This is my attempt at the conversion of it over to <span style="background-color:yellow;">java</span> </p>
<pre><code>public int winCraps{
    roll = rollDice();
    if (roll = 7 && 11){
    return (true);
    }
    else (roll =2 && 3 && 12){
    return(false);
    }
    else{
    return rollforPoint(roll);
}
}
</code></pre>
<p>2 ) Python </p>
<pre><code>def rollDice():
raw_input("Press <Enter> to roll...")
die1 = randrange(1,7)
die2 = randrange(1,7)
sum = die1 + die2
print "You rolled", die1, "+", die2, "=", sum
return sum
</code></pre>
<p>This one confused the hell out of me. What would randrange be in Java ? ? </p>
<p>Java </p>
<pre><code>static int rollDice(){
System.out.print("Press <Enter> to roll...");
double die1 = Math.random();
double die2 = Math.random();
die1 = (int) die1*6+1;
 die2 = (int) die2*6+1;
 int sum = (int)die1 + (int)die2;
 System.out.println("You rolled  "+die1+ " + "+die2+ " = "+sum+".");
 return sum;
 }
</code></pre>
<p>* please bear in mind that I 'm just learning this stuff lol </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-8 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>You need to fix your if statements the <span style="background-color:yellow;">"</span> = = <span style="background-color:yellow;">"</span> operator checks for equality , and you must put the variable you are checking against in each section of the statement . </p>
<pre><code>public int winCraps{
    roll = rollDice();
    if (roll == 7 || roll == 11) {
        return true;
    }
    else if(roll == 2 || roll == 3 || roll == 12) {
        return false;
    }
    else{
        return rollforPoint(roll);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>In you <span style="background-color:yellow;">rollDice</span> ( ) method , the way you assign values to each die is incorrect. I recommend reading up on random numbers ( since this is homework , I 'll leave that to you ) . </p>
<p>Also , remember in <span style="background-color:yellow;">java</span> you must always end each statement with a semicolon </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><blockquote>What would randrange be in Java ? </blockquote>
<p>You can get a random <span style="background-color:yellow;">integer</span> in a specific range from Java 's Random class by calling the nextInt ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">int</span> n ) method. For example, </p>
<pre><code>Random rand = new Random();
int a = rand.nextInt(7);
</code></pre>
<p>will give you a random <span style="background-color:yellow;">integer</span> &gt ; = 0 and &lt ; <span style="background-color:yellow;">7.</span> This is n't exactly the same as randrange in Python , but you could use it as the index to an array of objects , or as the value of a <span style="background-color:yellow;">roll</span> of a single die . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>Randrange can be replaced by methods in <span style="background-color:yellow;">java.util.Random</span> . Like Python , Java has an extensive standard library which you should reference . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>I 'd recommend that you look up the docs on randrange ( ) . Once you know exactly what it does , google for the those keywords , plus the word Java . </p>
<p>One thing you 'll quickly discover in working with languages is that the APIs can be very different. There might not be an equivalent of randrange in Java , but you might be able to find two or three functions that you can combine to do the same thing . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>System.out.print is n't going to cause the system to wait for someone to hit the enter key. For that , you need to do something with System.in , most likely System.in.read ( ) , as it blocks while waiting for input . </p>
<p>Also , in Java , a program starts executing with the main method. To be exact , an executable class starts something like this : </p>
<pre><code>// You'll need the Random class, as per other answers
import java.util.Random;
// assuming WinCraps is the class name
public class WinCraps {
    // args in this example is a string array of command-line arguments
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // This is where your main method (that calls winCraps?) would be
    }

    // Other methods
}
</code></pre>
<p>Also , any method in this class called directly from main must also be static . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>1 ) In Java <span style="background-color:yellow;">"</span> OR <span style="background-color:yellow;">"</span> operator is <span style="background-color:yellow;">"</span> | | <span style="background-color:yellow;">"</span> not <span style="background-color:yellow;">"</span> &amp ; &amp ; <span style="background-color:yellow;">"</span> and comparison operator is <span style="background-color:yellow;">"</span> = = <span style="background-color:yellow;">"</span> as in Python </p>
<p>So </p>
<pre><code>if roll == 7 or roll == 11:
</code></pre>
<p>Should be </p>
<pre><code>if( roll == 7 || roll == 11 ) {
</code></pre>
<p>and not </p>
<pre><code> if( roll = 7 && 11 ){
</code></pre>
<p>2 ) randrange is : random generator from there you can search : Random in Java </p>
<p>Which will lead you to something like : Random.nextInt ( ) </p>
<p>Use this algorithm ( a ) search Internet for Python function , b ) understand what it does c ) search it in <span style="background-color:yellow;">java</span> ) for the next assignment you have and you 're done . </p>
<p>You can always ask here again , that 's what this site is all about after all </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>Write out in English what the Python program does. Go through it line by line and explain to yourself what computations are evoked , in other words...what is happening ? </p>
<p>Afterwards , write the Java program from that description . </p>
<p>Never ever try to convert the text of a program from one language to another. You 'll run <span style="background-color:yellow;">into</span> a LOT of problems that way because every language is different , no matter how similar they look . </p>
<br /><b># <span style="background-color:yellow;">7</span> </b><br /><p>One major error in your first program that you have in the Java conversion is the conditionals . </p>
<p>Something like ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">roll</span> = 2 &amp ; &amp ; 3 &amp ; &amp ; 12 ) assigns 2 to <span style="background-color:yellow;">roll</span> and then applies AND operators. You also forgot the if. You have elseif in Python . </p>
<p>You want something like : </p>
<p>else if ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">roll</span> = = 2 | | <span style="background-color:yellow;">roll</span> = = 3 | | <span style="background-color:yellow;">roll</span> = = 12 ) </p>
<p>As for random numbers , there is a function for that in Java . </p>
