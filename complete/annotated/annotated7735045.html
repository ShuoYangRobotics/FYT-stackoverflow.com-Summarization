<h3>Question ( ID-7735045 ) : </h3><h2>syntax error due to several top-level functions in Python ? </h2><p>I searched and found a very similar question here Syntax Error when trying to define multiple functions in python ? </p>
<p>but the question was n't really answered </p>
<p>I am getting a syntax error at the second " def " . My indentation may be messed up here because I can not figure out the formatting in this place....BUT it is correct in my program , indentation is not the issue . </p>
<pre><code>def encryptChar(ch, key):
    newOrd = ord(ch) + key % 26
    if ord(ch) < 65:
        newOrd = ord(ch)
    elif ord(ch) < 91:
        if newOrd > 90:
            newOrd = newOrd - 26
        elif newOrd > 122:
            newOrd = newOrd - 26
    newch = chr(newOrd)
    return newch

def encryptString(string, key):
    newString = ""
    for i in range(len(string)):
         newString += encryptChar(string[i], key)
    return newString

def decryptString(string, key):
    newString = ""
    for i in range(len(string)):
         newString += encryptChar(string[i], -1*key)
    return newString
</code></pre>
<p>I 'm GUESSING it has something to do with the functions all being top level. But how do I fix it ? This is Python 2.7. ( I could include the top function inside the other 2 , but I am still left with 2 top level ) </p>
<p>Thanks for any help ! </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-6 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>I was able to run your code with no problems once I fixed the indentation error : </p>
<pre><code>def encryptString(string, key):
   newString = ""
   for i in range(len(string)):
        newString += encryptChar(string[i], key)
   return newString    # << HERE
</code></pre>
<h3>Demo : http : //codepad.org/eaaiHUJZ </h3>
<p>I would also rewrite your code as follows : </p>
<pre><code># because encryption is misnomer here
def rotateChar(ch, key):
    if 'a' <= ch < 'z':
        newOrd = (ord(ch) - ord('a') + key) % 26
        return chr(newOrd + ord('a'))
    elif 'A' < ch < 'Z':
        newOrd = (ord(ch) - ord('A') + key) % 26
        return chr(newOrd + ord('A'))
    else:
        return ch

def rotateString(st, key):
   return ''.join(rotateChar(c, key) for c in st)

def derotateString(st, key):
   return ''.join(rotateChar(c, -key) for c in st)
</code></pre>
<h3>Demo : Python 3 , Python 2 </h3>
<p>Finally , I will strongly advise against using this kind of " encryption " for anything that requires real security . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>The error message says exactly what 's wrong : </p>
<pre><code>  File "test.py", line 17
    return newString
                   ^
IndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level
</code></pre>
<p>On the line return newString , the indentation level does not match the previous indentation level of the for i in range ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">len</span> ( string ) ) line . </p>
<p></p>
<p>Secondly , do n't use the name string for a variable. string is also the name of a standard Python module , so you will be unable to use that module with your code , and you will confuse other people reading your code ( also do n't use str , since that 's the name of a built-in function ) . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>I did n't get a syntax error at the start of your function , but at the end of it.. . </p>
<pre><code>def encryptString(string, key):
   newString = ""
   for i in range(len(string)):
        newString += encryptChar(string[i], key)
    return newString 
</code></pre>
<p>Your return statement is indented one space further than the rest of the function , causing an IndentationError . </p>
<p>If you 're sure the error is at the beginning of the code , there 's another possibility. Stack Overflow automatically converts tabs to spaces in the code you post. If you were mixing tabs and spaces , you may have created an indentation error that is invisible to you. If you do n't want to try to fix it manually , most text editors will have a feature to replaces tabs with spaces for you , or you can just copy the code from your post back into your program . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>The problem is that return newString has an indentation level of 4 <span style="background-color:yellow;">characters</span> which does not match the earlier line at that level , which was at 3 <span style="background-color:yellow;">characters.</span> Try using an editor that makes it easy for you to always type 4-space tabs ; writing Python will be very painful if you have to line everything up by hand and keep running into errors like this . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>I do n't know if it is a copy and paster error , but your indentation is kind of messed up. Try using mine and see if you have the same problem : </p>

<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>What is the text of the error you 're getting ? Your function names should n't be clashing. My guess is that the extra space before return is giving you problems , but it would help to see the error . </p>
