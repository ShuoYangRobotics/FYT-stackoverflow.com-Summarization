<h3>Question ( ID-6981717 ) : </h3><h2>Pythonic way to combine FOR loop and IF statement </h2><p>I know how to use both for loops and if statements on separate lines , such as : </p>
<pre><code>a = [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0]
xyz = [0,12,4,6,242,7,9]
for x in xyz:
    if x in a:
        print x
>>> 0,4,6,7,9
</code></pre>
<p>And I know I can use a list comprehension to combine these when the statements are simple , such as : </p>
<pre><code>print [x for x in xyz if x in a]
</code></pre>
<p>But what I ca n't find is a good example anywhere ( to copy and learn from ) demonstrating a complex <span style="background-color:yellow;">set</span> of commands ( not just " print x " ) that occur following a combination of a for loop and some if statements. Something that I would expect looks like : </p>
<pre><code>for x in xyz if x not in a:
    print x...
</code></pre>
<p>Is this just not the way python is supposed to work ? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-6 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>You can use <span style="background-color:yellow;">generator</span> expressions like this : </p>
<pre><code>gen = (x for x in xyz if x not in a)

for x in gen:
    print x
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>As per The Zen of Python ( if you are wondering whether your code is " Pythonic " , that 's the place to go ) : </p>
<ul>Beautiful is better than ugly . Explicit is better than implicit . Simple is better than complex . Flat is better than nested . Readability counts . </ul>
<p>The Pythonic way of getting the sorted intersection of two <span style="background-color:yellow;">set</span> s is : </p>
<pre><code>>>> sorted(set(a).intersection(xyz))
[0, 4, 6, 7, 9]
</code></pre>
<p>Or those elements that are xyz but not in a : </p>
<pre><code>>>> sorted(set(xyz).difference(a))
[12, 242]
</code></pre>
<p>But for a more complicated loop you may want to flatten it by iterating over a well-named <span style="background-color:yellow;">generator</span> expression and/or calling out to a well-named function. Trying to fit everything on one line is rarely " Pythonic " . </p>

<h2>Update following additional comments on your question and the accepted answer </h2>
<p>I 'm not sure what you are trying to do with enumerate , but if a is a dictionary , you probably want to use the keys , like this : </p>
<pre><code>>>> a = {
...     2: 'Turtle Doves',
...     3: 'French Hens',
...     4: 'Colly Birds',
...     5: 'Gold Rings',
...     6: 'Geese-a-Laying',
...     7: 'Swans-a-Swimming',
...     8: 'Maids-a-Milking',
...     9: 'Ladies Dancing',
...     0: 'Camel Books',
... }
>>>
>>> xyz = [0, 12, 4, 6, 242, 7, 9]
>>>
>>> known_things = sorted(set(a.iterkeys()).intersection(xyz))
>>> unknown_things = sorted(set(xyz).difference(a.iterkeys()))
>>>
>>> for thing in known_things:
...     print 'I know about', a[thing]
...
I know about Camel Books
I know about Colly Birds
I know about Geese-a-Laying
I know about Swans-a-Swimming
I know about Ladies Dancing
>>> print '...but...'
...but...
>>>
>>> for thing in unknown_things:
...     print "I don't know what happened on the {0}th day of Christmas".format(thing)
...
I don't know what happened on the 12th day of Christmas
I don't know what happened on the 242th day of Christmas

<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>How about building a string and printing it at once ? </p>
<pre><code>res = ','.join(n for n in xyz 
                 if n in a)
print(res) 
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>a = [ 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 ] xyz = [ 0,12,4,6,242,7,9 ] <span style="background-color:yellow;">set</span> ( a ) &amp ; <span style="background-color:yellow;">set</span> ( xyz ) <span style="background-color:yellow;">set</span> ( [ 0 , 9 , 4 , 6 , 7 ] ) </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>You can use <span style="background-color:yellow;">generators</span> too , if <span style="background-color:yellow;">generator</span> expressions become too involved or complex : </p>
<pre><code>def gen():
    for x in xyz:
        if x in a:
            yield x

for x in gen():
    print x
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>I personally think this is the prettiest version : </p>
<pre><code>a = [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0]
xyz = [0,12,4,6,242,7,9]
for x in filter(lambda w: w in a, xyz):
  print x
</code></pre>
