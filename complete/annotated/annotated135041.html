<h3>Question ( ID-135041 ) : </h3><h2>Should you always favor xrange ( ) over <span style="background-color:yellow;">range</span> ( ) ? </h2><p>Why or why not ? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-7 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>For performance , especially when you 're iterating over a large <span style="background-color:yellow;">range</span> , xrange ( ) is usually better. However , there are still a few cases why you might prefer <span style="background-color:yellow;">range</span> ( ) : </p>
<ul>In python 3 , <span style="background-color:yellow;">range</span> ( ) will become an iterator anyway and will be the preferred spelling ( I 'm not sure if xrange will still exist for compatability - probably not though ) . Using <span style="background-color:yellow;">range</span> ( ) may make your code more portable going forward . <span style="background-color:yellow;">range</span> ( ) can actually be faster in some cases - eg. if iterating over the same sequence multiple times. xrange has to reconstruct the integer object every time , but <span style="background-color:yellow;">range</span> will have real integer objects. ( It will always perform worse in terms of memory however ) xrange is n't usable in all cases where a real list is needed. For instance , it does n't support slices , or any list methods . </ul>
<p>[ Edit ] There are a couple of posts mentioning how <span style="background-color:yellow;">range</span> ( ) will be upgraded by the 2to3 tool. For the record , here 's the output of running the tool on some sample usages of <span style="background-color:yellow;">range</span> ( ) and xrange ( ) </p>

<p>As you can see , when used in a for loop or comprehension , or where already wrapped with list ( ) , <span style="background-color:yellow;">range</span> is left unchanged . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>You should favour <span style="background-color:yellow;">range</span> ( ) over xrange ( ) only when you need an actual list. For instance , when you want to modify the list returned by <span style="background-color:yellow;">range</span> ( ) , or when you wish to slice it. For iteration or even just normal indexing , xrange ( ) will work fine ( and usually much more efficiently ) . There is a point where <span style="background-color:yellow;">range</span> ( ) is a bit faster than xrange ( ) for very small lists , but depending on your hardware and various other details , the break-even can be at a result of length 1 or 2 ; not something to worry about. Prefer xrange ( ) . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>xrange ( ) is more efficient because instead of generating a list of objects , it just generates one object at a time. Instead of 100 integers , and all of their overhead , and the list to put them in , you just have one integer at a time. Faster generation , better memory use , more efficient code . </p>
<p>Unless I specifically need a list for something , I always favor xrange ( ) </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>No , they both have their uses : </p>
<p>Use xrange ( ) when iterating , as it saves memory. Say : </p>
<pre><code>for x in xrange(1, one_zillion):
</code></pre>
<p>rather than : </p>
<pre><code>for x in range(1, one_zillion):
</code></pre>
<p>On the other hand , use <span style="background-color:yellow;">range</span> ( ) if you actually want a list of numbers . </p>
<pre><code>multiples_of_seven = range(7,100,7)
print "Multiples of seven < 100: ", multiples_of_seven
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Go with <span style="background-color:yellow;">range</span> for these reasons : </p>
<p>1 ) xrange will be going away in newer Python versions. This gives you easy future compatibility . </p>
<p>2 ) <span style="background-color:yellow;">range</span> will take on the efficiencies associated with xrange . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p><span style="background-color:yellow;">range</span> ( ) returns a list , xrange ( ) returns an xrange object . </p>
<p>xrange ( ) is a bit faster , and a bit more memory efficient. But the gain is not very large . </p>
<p>The extra memory used by a list is of course not just wasted , lists have more functionality ( slice , repeat , insert , ... ) . Exact differences can be found in the documentation . There is no bonehard rule , use what is needed . </p>
<p>Python 3.0 is still in development , but IIRC <span style="background-color:yellow;">range</span> ( ) will very similar to xrange ( ) of 2.X and list ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">range</span> ( ) ) can be used to generate lists . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>Okay , everyone here as a different opinion as to the tradeoffs and advantages of xrange versus <span style="background-color:yellow;">range.</span> They 're mostly correct , xrange is an iterator , and <span style="background-color:yellow;">range</span> fleshes out and creates an actual list. For the majority of cases , you wo n't really notice a difference between the two. ( You can use map with <span style="background-color:yellow;">range</span> but not with xrange , but it uses up more memory. ) </p>
<p>What I think you rally want to hear , however , is that the preferred choice is xrange. Since <span style="background-color:yellow;">range</span> in Python 3 is an iterator , the code conversion tool 2to3 will correctly convert all uses of xrange to <span style="background-color:yellow;">range</span> , and will throw out an error or warning for uses of <span style="background-color:yellow;">range.</span> If you want to be sure to easily convert your code in the future , you 'll use xrange only , and list ( xrange ) when you 're sure that you want a list. I learned this during the CPython sprint at PyCon this year ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">2008</span> ) in Chicago . </p>
