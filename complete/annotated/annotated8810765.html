<h3>Question ( ID-8810765 ) : </h3><h2><span style="background-color:yellow;">main</span> method in Python </h2><p>I have the following code , which has the following two problems : </p>

<p>should not be in the class. When you take it outside ( no indent ) it should work . </p>
<p>So after taking that into account it should look like this : </p>
<pre><code>class Animal:
    __hungry = "yes"
    __name = "no name"
    __owner = "no owner"

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def set_owner(self,newOwner):
        self.__owner= newOwner
        return

    def get_owner(self):
        return self.__owner

    def set_name(self,newName):
        self.__name= newName
        return

    def get_name(self):
        return self.__name

    def noise(self):
        print('errr')
        return

    def __hiddenmethod(self):
        print("hard to find")


def main():
    dog = Animal()    
    dog.set_owner('Sue')
    print dog.get_owner()
    dog.noise()


if  __name__ =='__main__':
    main()

<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>To understand why what you wrote failed , you need to know a little bit about how class definitions work in Python. As you may know , Python is an interpreted language : there is a program which reads through Python files and executes them as it goes. When the interpreter encounters a class definition , it does the following : </p>
<ol>Creates a new namespace ( record of all the variable names ) in which the class variables and methods will be stored . Extracts all the code within the class definition ( as determined by its indentation ) and runs that code. This will populate the namespace which it just created . Creates a new class <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> whose namespace is that given above , and with base classes those given in the definition . Binds the name of the class to this <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> . </ol>
<p>So what happened when you indented the <span style="background-color:yellow;">main</span> function inside your code ? While inside step 2 , you referred to the name <span style="background-color:yellow;">Animal</span> . But this name is n't defined until step 4 ! Indeed , it ca n't be defined at the stage you referred to it , because that would be circular. When you move <span style="background-color:yellow;">main</span> outside of the class definition , it wo n't be executed until after steps 1-4 have been completed , and hence the name <span style="background-color:yellow;">Animal</span> will already be bound . </p>
<hr />
<p>By the way , the code you have written is not good Python. You should probably try to find a better tutorial ; the usual recommendation is " Dive Into Python " . I 've rewritten it as it should be done : </p>
<pre><code>  class Animal(object):
      def __init__(self, hungry="yes", name=None, owner=None):
          self.hungry = hungry
          self.name = name
          self.owner = owner

      def noise(self):
          print('errr')

      def _internal_method(self):
          print("hard to find")

  if  __name__ =='__main__':
      dog = Animal()    
      dog.owner = 'Sue'
      print dog.owner
      dog.noise()

<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>Move both the <span style="background-color:yellow;">main</span> ( ) method and the if __name__ = = '__main__ ' statement out of the scope of the class. Remember - whitespace counts . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>Your indentation is off. Remember that in Python , indentation counts. Try : </p>
<pre><code>class Animal:
    __hungry = "yes"
    __name = "no name"
    __owner = "no owner"

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def set_owner(self,newOwner):
        self.__owner= newOwner
        return

    def get_owner(self):
        return self.__owner

    def set_name(self,newName):
        self.__name= newName
        return

    def get_name(self):
        return self.__name

    def noise(self):
        print('errr')
        return

    def __hiddenmethod(self):
        print("hard to find")

def main():
    dog = Animal()    
    dog.set_owner('Sue')
    print dog.get_owner()
    dog.noise()


if  __name__ =='__main__':main()

<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>The following construct is worth having in most of your code - particularly if you are running in multiple environments . </p>
<pre><code>if  __name__ =='__main__':
    main()
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>The <span style="background-color:yellow;">main</span> function you have defined looks like it is within the <span style="background-color:yellow;">Animal</span> class. Main should be a function ( classes contain methods ) outside of the animal class. You should also have your class <span style="background-color:yellow;">Animal</span> inherit from <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> ie </p>
<p>class <span style="background-color:yellow;">Animal</span> ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> ) : </p>
