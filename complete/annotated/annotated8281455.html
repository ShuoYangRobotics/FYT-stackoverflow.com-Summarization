<h3>Question ( ID-8281455 ) : </h3><h2>Python : how to use variables as a string ? </h2><p>Supose I have such variables : var1 , var2 , var3 , var4 , var 5 , ... , var100 ( lists and dictionaries are not suitable in my case , because all these vars are class <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> ) . </p>
<p>I must process all them in similar way , for example : </p>
<pre><code>if var1:
    print 'var1 is not None'
if var2:
    print 'var2 is not None'
if var3:
    print 'var3 is not None'
...
if var100:
    print 'var100 is not None'
</code></pre>
<p>In such way I will write 200 hundreds lines of code.. . </p>
<p>But maybe there is some way to process all of them in for statement , like : </p>
<pre><code>for i in range(1,101):
    if var%s % i: #I know this is not right, but idea is understood
        print 'var%s is not None' % i
</code></pre>
<p>So I will write only 3 lines of code . </p>
<p>Is it possible do in Python ? </p>
<p>Thanks ! </p>
<br /><h3><span style="background-color:yellow;">Answers</span> ( Total-6 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>locals ( ) returns a dictionary of local variables. Similarly , globals ( ) returns a dictionary of global variables. You can find the variable and its value in one of those , depending on where it was defined . </p>
<pre><code>for i in range(1,101):
    if ('var%s' % i) in locals():
        print 'var%s is not None' % i
        print locals()['var%s' % i]
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>I wish you had n't buried your actual requirement in the tenth comment underneath the main question. <span style="background-color:yellow;">Actually</span> , it appears that what you want is to dynamically get a property of a class - in this instance , a field in a Django model. That 's simple : you just do : </p>
<pre><code>getattr(instance, varname)
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>You can modify class attributes dynamically : </p>
<pre><code>class A(object):
    pass
for i in range(100):
    setattr(A, "var%i" % i, i)
</code></pre>
<p>creates a class with <span style="background-color:yellow;">100</span> attributes called <span style="background-color:yellow;">A.var0</span> to <span style="background-color:yellow;">A.var99</span> . There are two problems with this approach : </p>
<ol>The attributes are quite inconvenient to access. ( This is possible with getattr ( ) , but having them in a list would make iterating over them so much easier. ) If class <span style="background-color:yellow;">A</span> has a custom metaclass , it is unclear how that metaclass deals with the dynamically created attributes . </ol>
<p>From a quick glance at the Django source code , I can see that django.db.models.Model indeed has a custom metaclass , and indeed all attributes must already be defined at class creation time , so the above approach wo n't work. You 'll have to create the complete class dictionary before actually creating the class. Here is one approach to do so : </p>
<pre><code>model_dict = {}
for i in range(100):
    model_dict["var%i" % i] = models.CharField(max_length=10)
model_dict["var_list"] = model_dict.values()
MyModel = type("MyModel", (models.Model,), model_dict)
</code></pre>
<p>This uses the three-parameter form of type ( ) to dynamically create a type. This part addresses problem 2 . </p>
<p>To address problem 1 , the above code exposes also adds an attribute to the class that allows to acces all the models.CharField instances as a list rather than by name . </p>

<p>Hope this helps, </p>

<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Couple different ways to do it , either get the variable from the globals or locals dictionary like so : globals ( ) [ 'var1 ' ] </p>
<p>or import <span style="background-color:yellow;">__main__</span> and use getattr ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">__main__,'var1</span> ' ) </p>
<p>throw those into a for loop , assigning the variable name to a string andhave it returned eg </p>
<p>if your testing that the class exists , use a try except </p>
<pre><code>import __main__

for i in range(1,101):
  try:
    func = getattr(__main__,'var%s' % i)
    if func is not None:
      print 'var%s is not None' % i
  except:
    print 'var%s does not exist'
</code></pre>
<p>if it 's buried in a class use the class name rather than <span style="background-color:yellow;">__main__</span> . If the class name is var % s use getattr on func in the loop above to grab whatever it is you need out of each class . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>I think that a list or dictionary actually would be the most appropriate way to solve your problem. In Python , data structures can hold others <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects.</span> This includes <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> that you create yourself because there is no technical distinction from the programmer 's point of view between the types ( classes ) you define and the ones that are native to Python ( string , int , etc. ) </p>
