<h3>Question ( ID-8365714 ) : </h3><h2>Continue to elif after a nested if-statement ? </h2><p>If the nested if-statement does n't fulfill a condition , how do I continue on to the outer if ? Eg. I have this ( very impractical ) example : </p>
<pre><code>a = 2

if( a > 1 ):
    if( a == 3 ):
        print "yes"
elif( a == 2 ):
    print "yes"
</code></pre>
<p>I want a = = 2 to be checked next. How would I do this ? </p>
<p>( I have multiple conditions in that nested if that I need to check so I 'd rather not have a huge string of and/or statements in that one outer-if. I also have more than one elif statement so I do n't want to mash all the elifs together under that nested one. ) </p>
<p>A deeper example : </p>
<pre><code>b = 8

if( a > 1 ):
    if( b == 3 ):
        doSomething()
    elif( b == 4 ):
        doSomethingElse()
    elif( b == 5 ):
        more()
elif( -1 <= a <= 1 ):
    asd()
elif( a < -1 ):
    if( b == 7 ):
        asdfasdf()
    elif( b == 8 ):
        asasdf()
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-6 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>combine the conditions and flatten the nesting : </p>
<pre><code>a = 2

if ( a > 1 and a == 3 ):
    print "yes"
elif ( a == 2 ):
    print "yes"
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>Considering the example is just indicative but your original question was to understand nested if-else , association , scoping ... . </p>
<p>In Python , unlike Algol-like languages we do n't have demarcated blocks ( for ex. in C we use ' { ' to make a block. Here all blocks are via proper white-space indentation. Its like the philosophy , what you read is what you would get. This off-course is to adhere to the design philosophy " Code Readability " . </p>
<p>In similar context , whether the subsequent if/else statement would be part of the outer or inner if statement depends on how it was indented . </p>
<p>Your example </p>
<pre><code>a = 2

if( a > 1 ):
    if( a == 3 ):
        print "yes"
elif( a == 2 ):
    print "yes"
</code></pre>
<p>Here elif is part of the outer if , because that 's what it reads or rather looks and that 's how it was indented. Instead the below modified version of your code </p>
<pre><code>a = 2

if( a > 1 ):
    if( a == 3 ):
        print "yes"
    elif( a == 2 ):
        print "yes"
</code></pre>
<p>Would make the logic apparently different. More because the indented elif block is now aligned with the inner if . </p>
<p>This is now much easier compared to the following C Code </p>
<pre><code>if (a > 1) 
   if (a == 3)
      printf("Hello World\n");
else if (a == 2)
   printf("Yes");
</code></pre>
<p>Can you easily say with which if the else if is associated ? </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><pre><code>a = 2
if a > 1:
    if a == 3:
        print "a is 3"
    elif a == 2:
        print "a is 2"
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>What outcomes do you want : </p>
<ul>print " yes " when a is 2 or 3 otherwise do nothing </ul>
<p>Translate that into simple code </p>
<pre><code>if a in (2, 3):
    print "yes"
</code></pre>
<p>" deeper " example : You do n't need some of your nesting. The following simple code is equivalent to yours : </p>
<pre><code>if a == 1:
    if b == 7:
        print "yes 1, 7"
    elif b == 8:
        print "yes 1, 8"
elif a == 2:
    print "yes 2"
elif a == 3:
    print "yes 3"
elif a == 4:
    print "yes 4"
elif a == 5:
    print "yes 5"
</code></pre>
<p>By the way , please read PEP 8 and have a look at some of the code written by others... if ( foo = = 9 ) : is an unfamiliar pattern which causes readers to slow down over the speed humps , and possibly avoid that road in future . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Another way of writing this to make it easier to read and possibly easier to write would be to put the choices for one of the checks into a dictionary. This will only work if you actually are checking equality , but may work for you . </p>
<pre><code>#used when a>1
bchoices1 = {}
bchoices1[3] = doSomething
bchoices1[4] = doSomethingElse
bchoices1[5] = more

#used when a==1
bchoices2 = {}
bchoices2[7] = asdfasdf
bchoices2[8] = asdfas

if( a > 1 ):
    bchoices1[b]()
elif( a == 2 ):
    asd()
elif( a == 1 ):
    bchoices2[b]()
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>How do you expect this to be clear to a computer ? </p>
<pre><code>if a > 1:
  # ANYTHING
elif a == 2:
  # ANYTHING
</code></pre>
<p>by definition will never execute anything in the second block . </p>
<p>I believe your intend might be more along this lines : </p>
<pre><code>def action():
  if a > 1:
    if b == 2:
      doSomething()
      return
    if b == 3:
      doSomethingElse()
      return
 if a == 2: # Note: NO elif!
   doDefaultForA2()
   return
 showError("Unknown command")
 return
</code></pre>
<p>There are multiple ways to achieve this behaviour. I like the function + return pattern , because it structures code nicely. Another way is to use a handled flag : </p>
<pre><code>unhandled = True
if a > 1:
  if b == 2:
    doSomething()
    unhandled = False
  if unhandled and b == 3:
    doSomethingElse()
    unhandled = False
if unhandled and a == 2: # Note: NO elif!
  doDefaultForA2()
  unhandled = False
if unhandled:
  showError("Unknown command")
</code></pre>
<p>( You can obviously put in a number of shortcuts here by using elif. But using explicit " if unhandled " makes the code more verbose about the logic and easier to add new options. ) </p>
