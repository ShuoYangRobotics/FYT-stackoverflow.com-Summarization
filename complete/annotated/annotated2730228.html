<h3>Question ( ID-2730228 ) : </h3><h2>Python : does it make sense to refactor this <span style="background-color:yellow;">check</span> into its own method ? </h2><p>I 'm still learning python. I just wrote this method to determine if a <span style="background-color:yellow;">player</span> has won a game of tic-tac-toe yet , given a <span style="background-color:yellow;">board</span> state like : ' [ [ 'o','x','x ' ] , [ 'x','o','- ' ] , [ 'x','o','o ' ] ] ' </p>
<pre><code>def hasWon(board):
  players = ['x', 'o']
  for player in players:
    for row in board:
      if row.count(player) == 3:
        return player
    top, mid, low = board
    for i in range(3):
      if [ top[i],mid[i],low[i] ].count(player) == 3:
        return player
    if [top[0],mid[1],low[2]].count(player) == 3:
        return player
    if [top[2],mid[1],low[0]].count(player) == 3:
        return player
  return None
</code></pre>
<p>It occurred to me that I <span style="background-color:yellow;">check</span> lists of <span style="background-color:yellow;">3</span> chars several times and could refactor the <span style="background-color:yellow;">checking</span> to its own method like so : </p>
<pre><code>def check(list, player):
  if list.count(player) == 3:
    return player
</code></pre>
<p>...but then realized that all that really does is change lines like : </p>
<pre><code> if [ top[i],mid[i],low[i] ].count(player) == 3:
    return player
</code></pre>
<p>to : </p>
<pre><code>  if check( [top[i],mid[i],low[i]], player ):
    return player
</code></pre>
<p>...which frankly does n't seem like much of an improvement. Do you see a better way to refactor this ? Or in general a more Pythonic option ? I 'd love to hear it ! </p>

<pre><code>def check(somelist, player):
  return somelist.count(player) == 3
</code></pre>
<p>Edit : as @ Andrew suggested in a comment ( tx @ Andrew ! ) , you can do even better , e.g. : </p>
<pre><code>def check(somelist, player):
  return somelist.count(player) == len(somelist)
</code></pre>
<p>without hardcoding the <span style="background-color:yellow;">3</span> -- which also suggests another nice alternative : </p>
<pre><code>def check(somelist, player):
  return all(x==player for x in somelist)
</code></pre>
<p>which very directly reads " all items in the list equal <span style="background-color:yellow;">player</span> " . The general point is that by refactoring to a separate method you can then play with that method 's implementation -- now of course here the code is very simple so the advantage is similarly modest , but it 's an excellent point to keep in mind as you move to more complicated code . </p>
<p>As you 've noticed you only need a bool anyway , so this allows a much simpler approach -- just return the bool expression rather than doing an if on it. It 's important to never use a built-in name like list for your own identifiers -- an " attractive nuisance " of the language... ; - ) . </p>
<p>By which I mean , Python uses for its built-ins lots of nice , attractive names like list , bool , sum , and so on , so it 's easy to find yourself accidentally using one of those names for a variable of your own , and nothing bad seems to happen... until the time you need to turn , say , a tuple into a list , use the obviously best solution , x = list ( thetuple ) ... and end up spending our trying to understand and solve the errors that come because you 've used list to mean anything else than the built-in type of that name . </p>
<p>So , just get into the habit of not using those nice built-in names for purposes other than indicating the respective builtins , and you 'll save yourself much future aggravation ! - ) </p>
<p>Back to your code , you might consider the conciseness afforded by not unpacking <span style="background-color:yellow;">board</span> ( a hard decision , since your code is quite readable... but may look a bit verbose ) : </p>
<pre><code>for i in range(3):
  if check([row[i] for row in board], player):
    return player
if check([row[i] for i, row in enumerate(board)], player):
    return player
if check([row[2-i] for i, row in enumerate(board)], player):
    return player
</code></pre>
<p>In the end I think I 'd stick with your choice -- more readable and just marginally more verbose , if at all -- but it 's nice to be aware of the alternatives , I think -- here , list comprehensions and enumerate to generate the lists to be <span style="background-color:yellow;">checked</span> as an alternative to " manually coding out " the three possibilities . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>Simply make a custom iterator over <span style="background-color:yellow;">board</span> . </p>
<pre><code>def get_lines(board):
  nums = range(3)
  for i in nums: 
    yield (board[i][j] for j in nums) #cols
  for j in nums: 
    yield (board[i][j] for i in nums) #rows
  yield (board[i][i] for i in nums) #diag \
  yield (board[i][2-i] for i in nums) #diag /

def get_winner(board): #a bit too indented
  for line in get_lines(board): #more expensive, so go through it only once
    for player in 'x', 'o':
      if line == player, player, player: #other way to check victory condition
        return player
  return None
</code></pre>
<p>Obviously these really should be methods of a <span style="background-color:yellow;">board</span> class : ) </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>You could use a better name instead of <span style="background-color:yellow;">check</span> that does n't tell much. The rule of thumb is : if you can think of a good name for a peace of code then it might be beneficial to move it into separate function even if it is just one line of code. <span style="background-color:yellow;">allsame</span> might be one of alternatives here . </p>
<pre><code>def winner(board):
    main_diag = [row[i] for i, row in enumerate(board)]
    aux_diag = [row[len(board) - i - 1] for i, row in enumerate(board)]   
    for triple in board + zip(*board) + [main_diag, aux_diag]: 
        if allsame(triple):         
           return triple[0]

def allsame(lst):    
    return all(x == lst[0] for x in lst)
</code></pre>
<br /><b># <span style="background-color:yellow;">3</span> </b><br /><p>Personally I think your best bet for readability is to bubble out functions to give you the rows ( ) , columns ( ) , and diags ( ) of the <span style="background-color:yellow;">board</span> , as lists of lists. Then you can iterate through these and <span style="background-color:yellow;">check</span> uniformly. You can even then define allTriples ( ) , which appends the output of rows ( ) , columns ( ) , and diags ( ) , so that you can do your <span style="background-color:yellow;">checking</span> in a single concise loop. I 'd probably also make the <span style="background-color:yellow;">board</span> an object , so that these functions could become object methods . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>And now for something completely different : </p>
<p>Represent the <span style="background-color:yellow;">board</span> by a list of nine elements. Each element can be -1 ( X ) , 1 ( O ) , or 0 ( empty ) : </p>
<pre><code>WIN_LINES = (
    (0, 1, 2),
    (3, 4, 5),
    (6, 7, 8),
    (0, 3, 6),
    (1, 4, 7),
    (2, 5, 8),
    (2, 4, 6),
    (0, 4, 8),
    )

def test_for_win(board):
    for line in WIN_LINES:
        total = sum(board[point] for point in line)
        if abs(total) == 3:
            return total // 3
    return None
</code></pre>
<p>Refinement : </p>
<pre><code>WIN_LINES = (
    0, 1, 2,
    3, 4, 5,

        if total ==  3: return  1
        if total == -3: return -1
    return None

<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>Just an idea </p>
<pre><code>def hasWon(board):
  players = ['x', 'o']
  for player in players:
    top, mid, low = board
    game = board + [[ top[i],mid[i],low[i]] for i in range(3)] + [top[0],mid[1],low[2]] +[top[2],mid[1],low[0]]
    if 3 in [l.count(player) for l in game] :

  return None

<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>Your solution is fine - correct , readable and understandable . </p>
<p>Still , if you 'd want to optimize for speed , I 'd use a 1-dimensional array of digits , not strings , and try to look up each number as few times as possible. There will certainly be an extremely awkward-looking solution in which you <span style="background-color:yellow;">check</span> every field only once. I do n't want to construct this now. : ) Things like that might matter if you wanted to implement an AI playing against you while exploring the entire search tree of possible moves. An efficient win/loss <span style="background-color:yellow;">check</span> would be necessary there . </p>
