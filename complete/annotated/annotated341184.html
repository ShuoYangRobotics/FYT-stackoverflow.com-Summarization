<h3>Question ( ID-341184 ) : </h3><h2>Can I install python 3.x and 2.x on the same computer ? </h2><p>I 'm running windows and the shell/os automatically runs python based on the registry settings when you run a program on the command line. Will this break if I install a 2.x and 3.x version of python on the same machine ? </p>
<p>I want to play with 3.0 while still be able to run 2.x <span style="background-color:yellow;">scripts</span> on the same machine.. . </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-8 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>You can have both installed . </p>
<p>You should write in front of your <span style="background-color:yellow;">script</span> : </p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/env python2.6
</code></pre>
<p>or eventually. . </p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/env python3.0
</code></pre>
<h2>Update </h2>
<p>My solution work perfectly with Windows , after a quick search on Google , here is the Windows solution : </p>
<pre><code>#!c:/Python/python3_0.exe -u
</code></pre>
<p>Same thing... in front of your <span style="background-color:yellow;">script</span> </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>Here you go.. . </p>
<p>winpylaunch.py </p>
<pre><code>#
# Looks for a directive in the form: #! C:\Python30\python.exe
# The directive must start with #! and contain ".exe".
# This will be assumed to be the correct python interpreter to
# use to run the script ON WINDOWS. If no interpreter is
# found then the script will be run with 'python.exe'.
# ie: whatever one is found on the path.
# For example, in a script which is saved as utf-8 and which
# runs on Linux and Windows and uses the Python 2.6 interpreter...
#
#    #!/usr/bin/python
#    #!C:\Python26\python.exe
#    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
#
# When run on Linux, Linux uses the /usr/bin/python. When run
# on Windows using winpylaunch.py it uses C:\Python26\python.exe.
#
# To set up the association add this to the registry...
#
#    HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Python.File\shell\open\command
#    (Default) REG_SZ = "C:\Python30\python.exe" S:\usr\bin\winpylaunch.py "%1" %*
#
# NOTE: winpylaunch.py itself works with either 2.6 and 3.0. Once
# this entry has been added python files can be run on the
# commandline and the use of winpylaunch.py will be transparent.

<p>I 've just knocked this up on reading this thread ( because it 's what I was needing too ) . I have Pythons 2.6.1 and 3.0.1 on both Ubuntu and Windows. If it does n't work for you post fixes here . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>I 'm using 2.5 , 2.6 , and 3.0 from the shell with one line batch <span style="background-color:yellow;">scripts</span> of the form : </p>
<pre><code>:: The @ symbol at the start turns off the prompt from displaying the command.
:: The % represents an argument, while the * means all of them.
@c:\programs\pythonX.Y\python.exe %*
</code></pre>
<p>Name them pythonX.Y.bat and put them somewhere in your PATH. Copy the file for the preferred minor version ( i.e. the latest ) to pythonX.bat . ( E.g. copy python2.6.bat python2.bat . ) Then you can use python2 file.py from anywhere . </p>
<p>However , this does n't help or even affect the Windows file association situation. For that you 'll need a launcher program that reads the # ! line , and then associate that with .py and .pyw files . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>As far as I know Python runs off of the commandline using the PATH variable as opposed to a registry setting . </p>
<p>So if you point to the correct version on your PATH you will use that. Remember to restart your command prompt to use the new PATH settings . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>The Python installation normally associates .py , .pyw and .pyc files with the Python interpreter. So you can run a Python <span style="background-color:yellow;">script</span> either by double-clicking it in Explorer or by typing its name in a command-line window ( so no need to type python <span style="background-color:yellow;">scriptname.py</span> , just <span style="background-color:yellow;">scriptname.py</span> will do ) . </p>
<p>If you want to manually change this association , you can edit these keys in the Windows registry : </p>
<pre><code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Python.File\shell\open\command
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Python.NoConFile\shell\open\command
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Python.CompiledFile\shell\open\command
</code></pre>
<h2>Python Launcher </h2>
<p>People have been working on a Python launcher for Windows : a lightweight program associated with .py and .pyw files which would look for a " shebang " line ( similar to Linux et al ) on the first line , and launch Python 2.x or 3.x as required. See " A Python Launcher for Windows " blog post for details . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>I would assume so , I have Python 2.4 , 2.5 and 2.6 installed side-by-side on the same computer . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>I think there is an option to setup the windows file association for .py files in the installer. Uncheck it and you should be fine . </p>
<p>If not , you can easily re-associate .py files with the previous version. The simplest way is to right click on a .py file , select " open with " / " choose program " . On the dialog that appears , select or browse to the version of python you want to use by default , and check the " always use this program to open this kind of file " checkbox . </p>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>You should make sure that the PATH environment variable does n't contain both python.exe files ( add the one you 're currently using to run <span style="background-color:yellow;">scripts</span> on a day to day basis ) , or do as Kniht suggested with the batch files . Aside from that , I do n't see why not . </p>
<p>P.S : I have 2.6 installed as my " primary " python and 3.0 as my " play " python . The 2.6 is included in the PATH . Everything works fine . </p>
