<h3>Question ( ID-1093598 ) : </h3><h2>pyserial - How to Read Last Line Sent from Serial Device </h2><p>So I have an Arduino connected to my Windows XP computer. It 's just running a loop , sending a value over the <span style="background-color:yellow;">serial</span> port back to the computer every <span style="background-color:yellow;">100ms</span> . </p>
<p>I want to make a Python script that will <span style="background-color:yellow;">read</span> from the <span style="background-color:yellow;">serial</span> port only every few seconds , so I want it to just see the last thing sent from the Arduino . </p>
<p>How do you do this in Pyserial ? </p>
<p>Here 's the code I tried which does't work. It <span style="background-color:yellow;">reads</span> the <span style="background-color:yellow;">lines</span> sequentially . </p>
<pre><code>import serial
import time

ser = serial.Serial('com4',9600,timeout=1)
while 1:
    time.sleep(10)
    print ser.readline() #how to get most recent line sent from device?

<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-6 ) : </h3><b># <span style="background-color:yellow;">0</span> </b><br /><p>Perhaps I 'm misunderstanding your question , but as it 's a <span style="background-color:yellow;">serial</span> line , you 'll have to <span style="background-color:yellow;">read</span> everything sent from the Arduino sequentially - it 'll be buffered up in the Arduino until you <span style="background-color:yellow;">read</span> it . </p>
<p>If you want to have a status display which shows the latest thing sent - use a thread which incorporates the code in your question ( minus the sleep ) , and keep the last complete line <span style="background-color:yellow;">read</span> as the latest line from the Arduino . </p>
<p>Update : mtasic 's example code is quite good , but if the Arduino has sent a partial line when inWaiting ( ) is called , you 'll get a truncated line. Instead , what you want to do is to put the last complete line into last_received , and keep the partial line in buffer so that it can be appended to the next <span style="background-color:yellow;">time</span> round the loop. Something like this : </p>
<pre><code>def receiving(ser):
    global last_received

    buffer = ''
    while True:
        buffer = buffer + ser.read(ser.inWaiting())
        if '\n' in buffer:
            lines = buffer.split('\n') # Guaranteed to have at least 2 entries
            last_received = lines[-2]
            #If the Arduino sends lots of empty lines, you'll lose the
            #last filled line, so you could make the above statement conditional
            #like so: if lines[-2]: last_received = lines[-2]
            buffer = lines[-1]
</code></pre>
<p>Regarding use of <span style="background-color:yellow;">readline</span> ( ) : Here 's what the Pyserial documentation has to say ( slightly edited for clarity ) : </p>
<blockquote>Be careful when using " <span style="background-color:yellow;">readline</span> " . Do specify a <span style="background-color:yellow;">timeout</span> when opening the <span style="background-color:yellow;">serial</span> port , otherwise it could block forever if no newline character is received. Also note that " <span style="background-color:yellow;">readline</span> " only works with a <span style="background-color:yellow;">timeout.</span> It depends on having a <span style="background-color:yellow;">timeout</span> and interprets that as EOF ( end of file ) . </blockquote>
<p>which seems quite reasonable to me ! </p>
<br /><b># <span style="background-color:yellow;">1</span> </b><br /><p>These solutions will hog the CPU while waiting for characters . </p>
<p>You should do at least one blocking call to <span style="background-color:yellow;">read</span> ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">1</span> ) </p>
<pre><code>while True:
    if '\n' in buffer: 
        pass # skip if a line already in buffer
    else:
        buffer += ser.read(1)  # this will block until one more char or timeout
    buffer += ser.read(ser.inWaiting()) # get remaining buffered chars
</code></pre>
<p>...and do the split thing as before . </p>

<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>You will need a loop to <span style="background-color:yellow;">read</span> everything sent , with the last call to <span style="background-color:yellow;">readline</span> ( ) blocking until the <span style="background-color:yellow;">timeout.</span> So : </p>

<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Slight modification to mtasic &amp ; Vinay Sajip 's code : </p>
<p>While I found this code quite helpful to me for a similar application , I needed all the <span style="background-color:yellow;">lines</span> coming back from a <span style="background-color:yellow;">serial</span> device that would send information periodically . </p>
<p>I opted to pop the first element off the top , record it , and then rejoin the remaining elements as the new buffer and continue from there . </p>
<p>I realize that this is not what Greg was asking for , but I thought it was worth sharing as a side note . </p>
<pre><code>def receiving(ser):
    global last_received

    buffer = ''
    while True:
        buffer = buffer + ser.read(ser.inWaiting())
        if '\n' in buffer:
            lines = buffer.split('\n')
            last_received = lines.pop(0)

            buffer = '\n'.join(lines)

<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>For the benefit of people looking for answers to this : </p>
<p>Using .inWaiting ( ) inside an infinite loop may be problematic. Its may hog up the entire cpu depending on the implementation. Instead I would recommend using a specific size of data to be <span style="background-color:yellow;">read.</span> So in this case the following should be done for example : </p>
<pre><code>ser.read(1024)
