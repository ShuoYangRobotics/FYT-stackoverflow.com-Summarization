<h3>Question ( ID-7520031 ) : </h3><h2>Pointing to another <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> 's attributes and adding your own </h2><p>Suppose I have a class : </p>
<pre><code>class Car(object):
    def __init__(self, name, tank_size=10, mpg=30):
        self.name = name
        self.tank_size = tank_size
        self.mpg = mpg
</code></pre>
<p>I put together a list of the <span style="background-color:yellow;">cars</span> I 'm looking at : </p>
<pre><code>cars = []
cars.append(Car("Toyota", 11, 29))
cars.append(Car("Ford", 15, 12))
cars.append(Car("Honda", 12, 25))
</code></pre>
<p>If I assign a <span style="background-color:yellow;">name</span> to my current favorite ( a " pointer " into the list , if you will ) : </p>
<pre><code>my_current_fav = cars[1]
</code></pre>
<p>I can easily access the attributes of my current favorite : </p>
<pre><code>my_current_fav.name       # Returns "Ford"
my_current_fav.tank_size  # Returns 15
my_current_fav.mpg        # Returns 12
</code></pre>
<p>Here 's where I start getting foggy. I would like to provide additional " computed " attributes only for my current favorite ( let 's assume these attributes are too " expensive " to store in the original list and are easier to just compute ) : </p>
<pre><code>my_current_fav.range      # Would return tank_size * mpg = 180
                          # (if pointing to "Ford")
</code></pre>
<p>In my case , I just capitulated and added 'range ' as an attribute of <span style="background-color:yellow;">Car</span> ( ) . But what if storing 'range ' in each <span style="background-color:yellow;">Car</span> ( ) instance was expensive but calculating it was cheap ? </p>
<p>I considered making 'my_current_fav ' a sub-class of <span style="background-color:yellow;">Car</span> ( ) , but I could n't figure out a way to do that and still maintain my ability to simply " point " 'my_current_favorite ' to an entry in the 'cars ' list . </p>
<p>I also considered using decorators to compute and return 'range ' , but could n't figure out a way to also provide access to the attributes 'name ' , 'mpg ' , etc . </p>
<p>Is there an elegant way to point to any item in the list 'cars ' , provide access to the attributes of the instance being pointed to as well as provide additional attributes not found in the class <span style="background-color:yellow;">Car</span> ? </p>
<p>Additional information : After reading many of your answers , I see there is background information I should have put into the original question. Rather than comment on many answers individually , I 'll put the additional info here . </p>
<p>This question is a simplification of a more complicated issue. The original problem involves modifications to an existing library. While making <span style="background-color:yellow;">range</span> a method call rather than an attribute is a good way to go , changing </p>
<pre><code>some_var = my_current_favorite.range
</code></pre>
<p>to </p>
<pre><code>some_var = my_current_favorite.range()
</code></pre>
<p>in many existing user scripts would be expensive. Heck , tracking down those user scripts would be expensive . </p>
<p>Likewise , my current approach of computing <span style="background-color:yellow;">range</span> for every car is n't " expensive " in Python terms , but is expensive in run-time because the real-world analog requires slow calls to the ( embedded ) OS. While Python itself is n't slow , those calls are , so I am seeking to minimize them . </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-7 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>This is easiest to do for your example , without changing <span style="background-color:yellow;">Car</span> , and changing as little else as possible , with <span style="background-color:yellow;">__getattr__</span> : </p>
<pre><code>class Car(object):
    def __init__(self, name, tank_size=10, mpg=30):
        self.name = name
        self.tank_size = tank_size
        self.mpg = mpg

class Favorite(object):
    def __init__(self, car):
        self.car = car
    def __getattr__(self, attr):
        return getattr(self.car, attr)
    @property
    def range(self):
        return self.mpg * self.tank_size

cars = []
cars.append(Car("Toyota", 11, 29))
cars.append(Car("Ford", 15, 12))
cars.append(Car("Honda", 12, 25))

my_current_fav = Favorite(cars[1])

print my_current_fav.range
</code></pre>
<p>Any attribute not found on an instance of <span style="background-color:yellow;">Favorite</span> will be looked up on the <span style="background-color:yellow;">Favorite</span> instances car attribute , which you set when you make the <span style="background-color:yellow;">Favorite</span> . </p>
<p>Your example of <span style="background-color:yellow;">range</span> is n't a particularly good one for something to add to <span style="background-color:yellow;">Favorite</span> , because it should just be a property of car , but I used it for simplicity . </p>
<p>Edit : Note that a benefit of this method is if you change your favorite car , and you 've not stored anything car-specific on <span style="background-color:yellow;">Favorite</span> , you can change the existing favorite to a different car with : </p>
<pre><code>my_current_fav.car = cars[0] # or Car('whatever')
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>If you have access to the class ( and it sounds like you do ) , just create a function inside the class instead . </p>
<pre><code>def range(self):
    return self.tank_size * self.mpg
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>With regards to your example , you could make <span style="background-color:yellow;">range</span> a read-only property of class <span style="background-color:yellow;">Car</span> that would be computed on demand. No need for extra classes . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>Why do n't you just create a method : </p>
<pre><code>class Car(object):
    def __init__(self, name, tank_size=10, mpg=30):
        self.name = name
        self.tank_size = tank_size
        self.mpg = mpg

    def range(self):
        return self.tank_size * self.mpg
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Sounds like <span style="background-color:yellow;">range</span> ( ) should be a method of the class. Methods are very cheap - the <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> do n't store them. The downside is it is computed each time you access the value of <span style="background-color:yellow;">range</span> . </p>
<pre><code>class Car(object):
   def __init__(self, name, tank_size=10, mpg=30):
       [AS ABOVE]
   def range(self):
      return self.tank_size * self.mpg
</code></pre>
<p>If you prefer it to behave like a field , i.e. compute only once , you can store the value in the <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> during the <span style="background-color:yellow;">range</span> method : </p>
<pre><code>  def range(self):
     if not hasattr(self,'_rangeval'):
         self._rangeval = self.tank_size * self.mpg
     return self._rangeval
</code></pre>
<p>This takes advantage of the fact that you can dynamically create fields in <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> . </p>
<p>I do n't understand why the default would be 180 when the default of the computed values is 300. If this strange behaviour is important , you will need to set another flag to see if the other parameters have been initialised to the default or not . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>I 'm not sure I understand what you 're trying to do , so I 'm going to cover a few different possible understandings of what you 're thinking . </p>
<blockquote>In my case , I just capitulated and added 'range ' as an attribute of <span style="background-color:yellow;">Car</span> ( ) . But what if storing 'range ' in each <span style="background-color:yellow;">Car</span> ( ) instance was expensive but calculating it was cheap ? </blockquote>
<p>First off , worrying about things being " expensive " is usually not that Pythonic. If it really mattered , you would be using a lower-level language most of the time. But in general , if you want something to be calculated rather than stored , the natural way is to use a method. Add it to the <span style="background-color:yellow;">Car</span> class. It does not cost per-object , unless of course you explicitly replace the method on a per-object basis . </p>
<p>Here 's how it works : when you make a call to a_car.range ( ) , the <span style="background-color:yellow;">range</span> attribute is looked up in a_car first. If it 's not found there , then ( skipping lots and lots of details here ! ) the class of a_car is identified as <span style="background-color:yellow;">Car</span> , and the attribute is looked up there. You define <span style="background-color:yellow;">range</span> as a <span style="background-color:yellow;">Car</span> method , so it gets found there , and is determined to be something that 's actually callable , so it gets called. As a special syntax rule , a_car gets passed as the first parameter to the method ( all of which partly explains why you need to have an explicit parameter - <span style="background-color:yellow;">named</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">self</span> by convention - for methods in Python , unlike many other languages with an implicit this ) . </p>
<blockquote>I considered making 'my_current_fav ' a sub-class of <span style="background-color:yellow;">Car</span> ( ) , but I could n't figure out a way to do that and still maintain my ability to simply " point " 'my_current_favorite ' to an entry in the 'cars ' list . </blockquote>
<p>You can definitely store a subclass of <span style="background-color:yellow;">Car</span> in the same list as a bunch of ordinary <span style="background-color:yellow;">Car</span> s. No problem there. Heck , you can store a Banana in the same list as a bunch of <span style="background-color:yellow;">Car</span> s if you like ; Python is dynamically typed , and does n't care. It will figure out what kind of <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> something is at the exact moment that it becomes relevant . </p>
<p>What you ca n't easily do is cause an existing <span style="background-color:yellow;">Car</span> to become a MyFavouriteCar . If you created a new MyFavouriteCar that my_favourite_car refers to ( do n't say " points at " , please ; <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> references are a higher-level abstraction , and unlike Java there is no " null pointer " in Python - None is an <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> ) , then you could replace an existing car in the list with it , but it 's still a different <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> ( even if it 's somehow based on the original <span style="background-color:yellow;">Car</span> that it replaces ) . You can design in such a way that this does n't matter ; or you can resort to evil hackery ( which I wo n't explain here ) ; or you can ( much better in your case ) just offer the functionality to all <span style="background-color:yellow;">Cars</span> , because it 's really free to do so . </p>
<p>From the Zen of Python : Special cases are n't special enough . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>You talk about my_current_fav being a 'pointer ' -- I just want to make sure you realize that , in fact, </p>
<pre><code>my_current_fav = cars[1]
</code></pre>
<p>binds a <span style="background-color:yellow;">name</span> to <span style="background-color:yellow;">cars</span> [ 1 ] -- in other words , my_current_fav is <span style="background-color:yellow;">cars</span> [ 1 ] = = True . There is no pointing going on. If you really want a pointer-stlye you can do something like this : </p>
<pre><code>class Favorite(object):
    def __init__(self, car_list, index):
        self.car_list = car_list
        self.index = index
    def __getattr__(self, attr):
        return getattr(self.car_list[self.index], attr)
    def __index__(self):
        return self.index
    @property
    def range(self):
        return self.mpg * self.tank_size

my_current_fav = Favorite(cars, 1)

print my_current_fav.name
print my_current_fav.range
print cars[my_current_fav]
