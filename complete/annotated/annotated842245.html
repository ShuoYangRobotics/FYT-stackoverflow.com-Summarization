<h3>Question ( ID-842245 ) : </h3><h2>Which is more accurate , x * * .5 or math.sqrt ( x ) ? </h2><p>I recently discovered that x * * .5 and math.sqrt ( x ) do not always produce the same result in Python : </p>

<p>Checking all integers below 10 * * 7 produced an error rate of almost exactly 0.1 % , with the size of the error increasing ( slowly ) for larger numbers . </p>
<p>So the question is , which method is more accurate ? </p>
<p>Edit : For the record , this is n't current causing me issues , nor do I know of a case where it might. But it 's a slow Friday afternoon , so I ask out of curiosity and in the name of best practices. : - ) </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-9 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>Neither one is more accurate , they both diverge from the actual answer in equal parts : </p>

<blockquote>The math module wraps the platform C library math functions of the same names ; math.pow ( ) is most useful if you need ( or just want ) high compatibility with C extensions calling C 's pow ( ) . __builtin__.pow ( ) is the implementation of Python 's infix * * operator , and deals with complex numbers , unbounded integer powers , and modular exponentiation too ( the C pow ( ) does n't handle any of those ) . </blockquote>
<p>* * is more complete. math.sqrt is probably just the C implementation of sqrt which is probably related to pow . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>Both the pow function and the math.sqrt ( ) function can calculate results that are more accurate than what the default float type can store. I think the errors you 're seeing is a result of the limitations of floating point math rather than inaccuracies of the functions. Also , since when is a difference of ~ 10 ^ ( -13 ) a problem when taking the square root of a 7 digit number ? Even the most accurate physics calculations seldom requires that many significant digits.. . </p>
<p>Another reason to use math.sqrt ( ) is that it 's easier to read and understand , which generally is a good reason to do things a certain way . </p>

<pre><code>>>> import decimal
>>> decimal.getcontext().prec = 60
>>> decimal.Decimal(8885558).sqrt()
Decimal("2980.86531061032678789963529280900544861029083861907705317042")

<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>Any time you are given a choice between two functions which are built into a language , the more specific function will almost always be equal to or better than the generic one ( since if it was worse , the coders would 've just implemented it in terms of the generic function ) . Sqrt is more specific than generic exponentiation so you can expect it 's a better choice. And it is , at least in terms of speed. In terms of accuracy , you are n't dealing with enough precision in your numbers to be able to tell . </p>
<p>Note : To clarify , sqrt is faster in Python 3.0. It 's slower in older versions of Python. See J.F. Sebastians measurements at http : //stackoverflow.com/questions/327002/python-which-is-faster-x-5-or-math-sqrtx . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>I got the same issue with you on Win XP Python 2.5.1 , while I do n't on 32-bit Gentoo Python 2.5.4. It 's a matter of C library implementation . </p>
<p>Now , on Win , math.sqrt ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">8885558</span> ) * * 2 gives <span style="background-color:yellow;">8885558.0000000019</span> , while ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">8885558</span> * * .5 ) * * 2 gives 8885557.9999999981 , which seem to amount to the same epsilon . </p>
<p>I say that one can not really say which one is the " better " option . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>This has to be some kind of platform-specific thing because I get different results : </p>

<p>What version of python are you using and what OS ? </p>
<p>My guess is that it has something to do with promotion and casting. In other words , since you 're doing <span style="background-color:yellow;">8885558</span> * * .5 , <span style="background-color:yellow;">8885558</span> has to be promoted to a float. All this is handled differently depending on the operating system , processor , and version of Python. Welcome to the wonderful world of floating point arithmetic. : - ) </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>I do n't get the same behavior. Perhaps the error is platform specific ? On amd64 I get this : </p>

<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>In theory math.sqrt should have a higher precision then math.pow. See Newton 's method to compute square roots [ 0 ] . However the limitation in the number of <span style="background-color:yellow;">decimal</span> digits of the python float ( or the C double ) will probably mask the difference . </p>
