<h3>Question ( ID-5190507 ) : </h3><h2>How do I grep for words coming from a file in files listed in a file ? </h2><p>Searching a single file for a word is easy : </p>
<pre><code>grep stuff file.txt
</code></pre>
<p>But I have many files , each is a line in files.txt , and many words I want to find , each is a line in words.txt . The output should be a file with each line a = &gt ; b with a being the line number in words.txt , b being the line number in files.txt . </p>
<p>I need to run it on OSX , so preferably something simple in shell , but any other language would be fine. I have n't had much experience with shell scripts myself , and I 'm more used to languages that are n't useful for string searching ( namely C - I 'm guessing Perl or Python may be helpful , but I 've not used them ) . </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-8 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>First , learn to specify the files of interest. In one directory or more than one directory ? The Unix find utility will do that . </p>
<p>At the Bash prompt : </p>
<pre><code>$ cd [the root directory where your files are]
$ find . -name "*.txt"
</code></pre>
<p>You did not say , but assumably the files are describable with " star dot something " then find will find the files . </p>
<p>Next , pipe the files names to what you want to do to them : </p>
<pre><code>$ find . -name "*.txt" -print0 | xargs -0 egrep 'stuff'
</code></pre>
<p>That will run egrep on each file with the search pattern of stuff </p>
<p>Google find plus xargs for literally thousands of examples. Once you are comfortable finding the files -- rephrase your question so that it is a bit more obvious what you want to do to them. Then I can help you with Perl to do it . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>You might this to be faster , more Pythonic , and easier to understand : </p>
<pre><code>with open("words.txt") as words:
    wlist=[(ln,word.strip()) for ln,word in enumerate(words,1)]

with open("files.txt") as files:
    flist=[(ln,file.strip()) for ln,file in enumerate(files,1)]

for filenum, filename in flist:
    with open(filename) as fdata:
        for fln,line in enumerate(fdata,1):
            for wln, word in wlist:
                if word in line:
                    print "%d => %d" % (wln, fln)
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>This is a two-parter with awk : 1. scan each file in files.txt , and map the word number to the name of the file 2. map the <span style="background-color:yellow;">filename</span> to the line number in files.txt </p>
<pre><code>awk '
  NR == FNR {word[$1] = NR; next}
  {for (i=1; i<=NF; i++) {if ($i in word) {print word[$i] " => " FILENAME; break}}}
' words.txt $(<files.txt) | 
sort -u |
awk '
  NR == FNR {filenum[$1] = NR; next}
  {$3 = filenum[$3]; print}
' files.txt -
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>Here 's something that will do what you want , but the only thing is that it will not print out the matched word , instead just prints out the line matched , the file name , and the line number. However , if you use --color = auto on grep , it will highlight the matched words using whatever you have set in $ { GREP_COLOR } , the default is red . </p>
<pre><code>cat files.txt | xargs grep -nf words.txt --color=auto
</code></pre>
<p>This command will dump all contents of files.txt , line by line , and it will pipe the file names to grep , which will search the file for every word that matches in words.txt . Similar to files.txt , words.txt should be all the search terms you want delimited by new-lines . </p>
<p>If your grep was built with the perl regular expression engine , then , you can use Perl regular expressions if you pass the -P option to grep like so : </p>
<pre><code>grep -Pnf words.txt --color=auto
</code></pre>
<p>Hope this helps . </p>
<p>Update : At first , I was n't really sure what @ Zeophlite was asking but after he posted his example , I see what he wanted. Here 's a python implementation of what he wants to do : </p>
<pre><code>from contextlib import nested


def search_file(line_num, filename):
    with nested(open(filename), open('words.txt')) as managers:
        open_filename, word_file = managers
        for line in open_filename:
            for wordfile_line_number, word in enumerate(word_file, 1):
                if word.strip() in line:
                    print "%s => %s" % (line_num, wordfile_line_number)


with open('files.txt') as filenames_file:
    for filenames_line_number, fname in enumerate(filenames_file, 1):
        search_file(filenames_line_number, fname.strip())
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>The following script in python does it. This is my first attempt at python , so I 'd appreciate any comments </p>
<pre><code>flist = open('files.txt')

filenum = 0
for filename in flist:
    filenum = filenum + 1
    filenamey = filename.strip()
    filedata = open(filenamey)
    for fline in filedata:
        wordnum = 0
        wlist = open('words.txt')
        for word in wlist:
            wordnum = wordnum + 1
            sword = word.strip()
            if sword in fline:
                s = repr(filenum) + ' => ' + repr(wordnum)
                print s
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>To answer your demand </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>Your code : </p>
<pre><code>flist = open('files.txt') 

filenum = 0 
for filename in flist: 
    filenum = filenum + 1 
    filenamey = filename.strip() 
    filedata = open(filenamey) 
    for fline in filedata: 
        wordnum = 0 
        wlist = open('words.txt') 
        for word in wlist: 
            wordnum = wordnum + 1 
            sword = word.strip() 
            if sword in fline: 
                s = repr(filenum) + ' => ' + repr(wordnum) 
                print s 
</code></pre>
<p>You <span style="background-color:yellow;">open</span> 'files.txt ' but do n't close it . with <span style="background-color:yellow;">open</span> ( 'files.txt ' ) as flist : is preferable because it is textually cleaner and it manages to close alone . </p>
<p>Instead of <span style="background-color:yellow;">filenum</span> = <span style="background-color:yellow;">filenum</span> + 1 , use enumerate ( ) From now , you must never forget enumerate ( ) because it is an extremely useful function. It works very very fast , too . </p>
<p>fline is n't a good name for an iterator of lines , IMO ; Is n't line a good one ? </p>
<p>The instruction wlist = <span style="background-color:yellow;">open</span> ( 'words.txt ' ) is n't in a good place : it is executed not only each for each file <span style="background-color:yellow;">opened</span> , but even each time a line is analysed . Moreover , the treatment of the names listed in wlist is performed each time the wlist is iterated , that is to say at each line. You must put this treatment out of all the iterations . </p>
<p>wordnum is nothing else than the index of word in wlist . You can use again enumerate ( ) or simply loop with index i and use wlist [ i ] instead of word </p>
<p>Each time a sword of wlist is in the line , you do </p>
<pre><code>print repr(filenum) + ' => ' + repr(wordnum) 
</code></pre>
<p>It would be better to do print repr ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">filenum</span> ) + ' = &gt ; ' + repr ( all_wordnum ) in which all_wordnum would be the list of all the sword found in one line </p>
<p>You keep your list of words in a file. You 'd better serialise the list of this words. See the modules pickle and pickle </p>
<p>There is also something to improve in the recording of result. Because executing the instruction </p>
<pre><code>print repr(filenum) + ' => ' + repr(wordnum)
</code></pre>
<p>each time is not a good practice. It 's the same if you want to record in a file : you ca n't repeatedly order write ( ) Better is to list all the result in a list , and print or record when process is over , making " \ n " .join ( list ) or something like that </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>Doing it in pure shell , I 'm close : </p>
<pre><code>$ grep -n $(tr '\n' '|' < words.txt | sed 's/|$//') $(cat files.txt)
</code></pre>
<p>( Tried to figure out how to remove the $ ( cat files.txt ) , but could n't ) </p>
<p>This prints out the words in each file , and prints out the lines where they occur , but it does n't print out the line in words.txt where that word was located . </p>
<p>There 's probably some really ugly ( if you did n't think this was ugly enough ) stuff I could do , but your real answer is to use a higher level language. The awk solution is shellish since most people now consider awk as just part of the Unix environment. However , if you 're using awk , you might as well use perl , python , or ruby . </p>
<p>The only advantage awk has is that it is automatically included in a Linux/Unix distro even if the user who created the distro did n't include any of the development packages. It 's rare , but it happens . </p>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>A pure sh answer , assuming that words or <span style="background-color:yellow;">filenames</span> do not contain any shell metacharacters such as blanks : </p>
<pre><code>nw=0; while read w; do nw=`expr $nw + 1`; nf=0; { while read f; do nf=`expr $nf + 1`; fgrep -n $w $f | sed 's/:.*//' | while read n; do echo $nw =\> $nf; done; done < /tmp/files.txt;}; done < /tmp/words.txt
</code></pre>
<p>But I prefer Perl for this kind of thing . And the Perl script wo n't be quite as short or readable as carrrot-top 's Python code , unless you use IO : : All . </p>
