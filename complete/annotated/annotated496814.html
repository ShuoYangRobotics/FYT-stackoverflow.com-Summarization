<h3>Question ( ID-496814 ) : </h3><h2>Progress bar not updating during operation </h2><p>in my python program to upload a file to the internet , im using a GTK <span style="background-color:yellow;">progress</span> bar to show the upload <span style="background-color:yellow;">progress.</span> But the problems that im facing is that the <span style="background-color:yellow;">progress</span> bar does not show any activity until the upload is complete , and then it abruptly indicates upload complete. im using pycurl to make the http requests...my question is - do i need to have a multi-threaded application to upload the file and simultaneously update the gui ? or is there some other mistake that im making ? </p>
<p>Thanks in advance ! </p>

<blockquote>You have created a <span style="background-color:yellow;">progress</span> bar inside a window , then you start running a loop that does some work : </blockquote>
<pre><code>while work_left:
    ...do something...
    progressbar.set_fraction(...)
</code></pre>
<blockquote>You will notice that the window does n't even show up , or if it does the <span style="background-color:yellow;">progress</span> bar stays frozen until the end of the task. The explanation is simple : gtk is event driven , and you are stealing control away from the gtk main loop , thus preventing it from processing normal GUI update events . The simplest solution consists on temporarily giving control back to gtk every time the <span style="background-color:yellow;">progress</span> is changed : </blockquote>
<pre><code>while work_left:
    ...do something...
    progressbar.set_fraction(...)
    while gtk.events_pending():
        gtk.main_iteration()
</code></pre>
<blockquote>Notice that with this solution , the user can not quit the application ( gtk.main_quit would not work because of new loop [ gtk.main_iteration ( ) ] ) until your heavy_work is done . Another solution consists on using gtk idle functions , which are called by the gtk main loop whenever it has nothing to do. Therefore , gtk is in control , and the idle function has to do a bit of work. It should return True if there 's more work to be done , otherwise False . The best solution ( it has no drawbacks ) was pointed out by James Henstridge. It is taking advantage of python 's generators as idle functions , to make python automatically preserve the state for us. It goes like this : </blockquote>
<pre><code>def my_task(data):
    ...some work...
    while heavy_work_needed:
        ...do heavy work here...
        progress_label.set_text(data) # here we update parts of UI
        # there's more work, return True
        yield True
    # no more work, return False
    yield False

def on_start_my_task_button_click(data):
    task = my_task(data)
    gobject.idle_add(task.next)
</code></pre>
<blockquote>The 'while ' above is just an example. The only rules are that it should yield True after doing a bit of work and there 's more work to do , and it must yield False when the task is done . </blockquote>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>More than likely the issue is that in your <span style="background-color:yellow;">progress</span> callback , which is where I presume you 're updating the <span style="background-color:yellow;">progress</span> bar , you 're not making a call to manually update the display i.e. run through the GUI 's event loop. This is just speculation though , if you can provide more code , it might be easier to narrow it down further . </p>
<p>The reason you need to manually update the display is because your main thread is also performing the upload , which is where it 's blocking . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>here is the code im using to set the <span style="background-color:yellow;">progress</span> bar fraction. what do i need to do , to update the display manually ? </p>
<p>( mainwin is the module with the window , mainw is the actual window and prog_bar is the <span style="background-color:yellow;">progress</span> bar component of the window. ) </p>
<pre><code>#Callback function invoked when download/upload has progress
def progress(download_t, download_d, upload_t, upload_d):
    print 'in fileupload progress'
    mainwin.mainw.prog_bar.set_fraction(upload_d/upload_t)
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>In python 2.x integer operands result in integer division. Try this : </p>
<pre><code>#Callback function invoked when download/upload has progress
def progress(download_t, download_d, upload_t, upload_d):
    print 'in fileupload progress'
    mainwin.mainw.prog_bar.set_fraction(float(upload_d) / upload_t)
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Yes , you probably need concurrency , and yes threads are one approach , but if you do use threads , please use an method like this one : http : //unpythonic.blogspot.com/2007/08/using-threads-in-pygtk.html which will abstract away the pain , and allow you to focus on the important aspects . </p>
<p>( I have not repeated everything in that blog post through laziness , hence community wiki ) . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>One option , if you are not married to pycurl , is to use GObject 's IO watchers . </p>
<p>http : //pygtk.org/pygtk2reference/gobject-functions.html # function-gobject--io-add-watch </p>
<p>Using this you can interleave the file upload with the normal PyGTK event loop , and even do the set_progress call in your IO watch callback. If you are offloading all the work for uploading onto pycurl this is not really feasible , but if you 're just uploading a file over HTTP , io_add_watch will make using a socket for this much less painful as well . </p>
