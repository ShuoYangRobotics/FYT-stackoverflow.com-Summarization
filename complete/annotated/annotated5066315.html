<h3>Question ( ID-5066315 ) : </h3><h2>Why is super ( ) broken in Python-2.x ? </h2><p>It 's often stated that super should be avoided in Python 2. I 've found in my use of super in Python 2 that it never acts the way I expect unless I provide all arguments such as the example : </p>
<pre><code>super(ThisClass, self).some_func(*args, **kwds)
</code></pre>
<p>It seems to me this defeats the purpose of using super ( ) , it 's neither more concise , or much better than TheBaseClass.some_func ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">self</span> , * args , * * kwds ) . For most purposes method resolution order is a distance fairy tale . </p>
<ul>Other than the fact that 2.7 is the last major release to Python 2 , why does super remain broken in Python 2 ? How and why has Python 3 's super changed ? <span style="background-color:yellow;">Are</span> there any caveats ? When and why should I use super going forward ? </ul>
<br /><h3><span style="background-color:yellow;">Answers</span> ( Total-6 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>super ( ) is not broken , in Python 2 or Python 3 . </p>
<p>Let 's consider the arguments from the blog post : </p>
<ul>It does n't do what it sounds like it does . </ul>
<p>OK , you may agree or disagree on that , it 's pretty subjective. What should it have been called then ? super ( ) is a replacement for calling the superclass directly , so the name seems fine to me. It does NOT call the superclass directly , because if that was all it did , it would be pointless , as you could do that anyway. OK , admittedly , that may not be obvious , but the cases where you need super ( ) are generally not obvious. If you need it , you are doing some pretty hairy multiple inheritance. It 's not going to be obvious. ( Or you are doing a simple mixin , in which case it will be pretty obvious and behave as you expect even if you did n't read the docs ) . </p>
<p>If you can call the superclass directly , that 's probably what you 'll end up doing. That 's the easy and intuitive way of doing it. super ( ) only comes into play when that does n't work . </p>
<ul>It does n't mesh well with calling the superclass directly . </ul>
<p>Yes , because it 's designed to solve a problem with doing that. You can call the superclass directly if , and only if , you know exactly what class that is. Which you do n't for mixins , for example , or when your class hierarchy is so messed up that you actually are merging two branches ( which is the typical example in all examples of using super ( ) ) . </p>
<p>So as long as every class in your class hierarchy has a well defined place , calling the superclass directly works. If you do n't , then it does not work , and in that case you must use super ( ) instead. That 's the point of super ( ) that it figures out what the " next superclass " is according to the MRO , without you explicitly having to specify it , because you ca n't always do that because you do n't always know what it is , for example when using mixins . </p>
<ul>The completely different programming language Dylan , a sort of lisp-thingy , solves this in another way that ca n't be used in Python because it 's very different . </ul>
<p>Eh. OK ? </p>
<ul>super ( ) does n't call your superclass . </ul>
<p>Yeah , you said that . </p>
<ul>Do n't mix super ( ) and direct calling . </ul>
<p>Yeah , you said that too . </p>
<p>So , there is two arguments against it : 1. The name is bad. 2. You have to use it consistently . </p>
<p>That does not translate to it being " broken " or that it should be " avoided " . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>super ( ) is not broken -- it just should not be considered the standard way of calling a method of the base class. This did not change with Python 3.x. The only thing that changed is that you do n't need to pass the arguments <span style="background-color:yellow;">self</span> , cls in the standard case that <span style="background-color:yellow;">self</span> is the first parameter of the current function and cls is the class currently being defined . </p>
<p>Regarding your question when to actually use super ( ) , my answer would be : hardly ever. I personally try to avoid the kind of multiple inheritance that would make super ( ) useful . </p>
<p>Edit : <span style="background-color:yellow;">An</span> example from real life that I once ran into : I had some classes defining a <span style="background-color:yellow;">run</span> ( ) method , some of which had base classes. I used super ( ) to call the inherited constructors -- I did not think it mattered because I was using single inheritance only : </p>
<pre><code>class A(object):
    def __init__(self, i):
        self.i = i
    def run(self, value):
        return self.i * value

class B(A):
    def __init__(self, i, j):
        super(B, self).__init__(i)
        self.j = j
    def run(self, value):
        return super(B, self).run(value) + self.j
</code></pre>
<p>Just imagine there were several of these classes , all with individual constructor prototypes , and all with the same interface to <span style="background-color:yellow;">run</span> ( ) . </p>
<p>Now I wanted to add some additional functionality to all of these classes , say logging. The additional functionality required an additional method to be defined on all these classes , say <span style="background-color:yellow;">info</span> ( ) . I did not want to invade the original classes , but rather define a second set of classes inheriting from the original ones , adding the <span style="background-color:yellow;">info</span> ( ) method and inheriting from a mix-in providing the actual logging. Now , I could not use super ( ) in the constructor any more , so I used direct calls : </p>
<pre><code>class Logger(object):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def run_logged(self, value):
        print "Running", self.name, "with info", self.info()
        return self.run(value)

class BLogged(B, Logger):
    def __init__(self, i, j):
        B.__init__(self, i, j)
        Logger.__init__("B")
    def info(self):
        return 42
</code></pre>
<p>Here things stop working. The super ( ) call in the base class constructor suddenly calls <span style="background-color:yellow;">Logger.__init__</span> ( ) , and <span style="background-color:yellow;">BLogged</span> ca n't do anything about it. There is actually no way to make this work , except for removing the super ( ) call in <span style="background-color:yellow;">B</span> itself . </p>
<p>[ <span style="background-color:yellow;">Another</span> Edit : I do n't seem to have made my point , judging from all the comments here and below the other answers. Here is how to make this code work using super ( ) : </p>
<pre><code>class A(object):
    def __init__(self, i, **kwargs):
        super(A, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.i = i
    def run(self, value):
        return self.i * value

class B(A):
    def __init__(self, j, **kwargs):
        super(B, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.j = j
    def run(self, value):
        return super(B, self).run(value) + self.j

class Logger(object):
    def __init__(self, name, **kwargs):
        super(Logger,self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.name = name
    def run_logged(self, value):
        print "Running", self.name, "with info", self.info()
        return self.run(value)

class BLogged(B, Logger):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(BLogged, self).__init__(name="B", **kwargs)
    def info(self):
        return 42

b = BLogged(i=3, j=4)

<p>Compare this with the use of explicit superclass calls. You decide which version you prefer. ] </p>
<p>This and similar stories are why I think that super ( ) should not be considered the standard way of calling methods of the base class . It does not mean super ( ) is broken . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>You seem to imply in your post that </p>
<pre><code>def some_func(self, *args, **kwargs):
    self.__class__.some_func(self, *args, **kwargs)
</code></pre>
<p>is not an infinite recursion. It is , and super would be more correct . </p>
<p><span style="background-color:yellow;">Also</span> , yes , you are required to pass all arguments to super ( ) . This is a bit like complaining that max ( ) does n't work like expected unless you pass it all the numbers you want to check . </p>
<p>In 3.x , however , fewer arguments are needed : you can do super ( ) .foo ( * args , * * kwargs ) instead of super ( ThisClass , <span style="background-color:yellow;">self</span> ) .foo ( * args , * * kwargs ) . </p>
<hr />
<p><span style="background-color:yellow;">Anyway</span> , I 'm unsure as to any situations when super should be avoided. Its behavior is only " weird " when MI is involved , and when MI is involved , super ( ) is basically your only hope for a correct solution. In Single-Inheritance it 's just slightly wordier than SuperClass.foo ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">self</span> , * args , * * kwargs ) , and does nothing different . </p>
<p>I think I agree with Sven that this sort of MI is worth avoiding , but I do n't agree that super is worth avoiding. If your class is supposed to be inherited , super offers users of your class hope of getting MI to work , if they 're weird in that way , so it makes your class more usable . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>Did you read the article that you link it ? It does n't conclude that super should be avoided but that you should be wary of its caveats when using it. These caveats are summarized by the article , though I would disagree with their suggestions . </p>
<p>The main point of the article is that multiple inheritance can get messy , and super does n't help as much as the author would want. However doing multiple inheritance without super is often even more complicated . </p>
<p>If you 're not doing multiple inheritance , super gives you the advantage that anyone inheriting from your class can add simple mixins and their <span style="background-color:yellow;">__init__</span> would be properly called. Just remember to always call the <span style="background-color:yellow;">__init__</span> of the superclass , even when you 're inheriting from <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> , and to pass all the remaining arguments ( * a and * * kw ) to it. When you 're calling other methods from the parent class also use super , but this time use their proper signature that you already know ( i.e. ensure that they have the same signature in all classes ) . </p>
<p>If you 're doing multiple inheritance you 'd have to dig deeper than that , and probably re-read the same article more carefully to be aware of the caveats. <span style="background-color:yellow;">And</span> it 's also only during multiple inheritance when you might a situation where an explicit call to the parent might be better than super , but without a specific scenario nobody can tell you whether super should be used or not . </p>
<p>The only change in super in Python 3.x is that you do n't need to explicitly pass the current class and <span style="background-color:yellow;">self</span> to it. This makes super more attractive , because using it would mean no hardcoding of either the parent class or the current class . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>@ Sven Marnach : </p>
<p>The problem with your example is that you mix explicit superclass calls <span style="background-color:yellow;">B.__init__</span> and <span style="background-color:yellow;">Logger.__init__</span> in <span style="background-color:yellow;">Blogged</span> with super ( ) in <span style="background-color:yellow;">B.</span> That wo n't work. Either you use all explicit superclass calls or use super ( ) on all classes. When you use super ( ) you need to use it on all classes involved , including <span style="background-color:yellow;">A</span> I think. <span style="background-color:yellow;">Also</span> in your example I think you could use explicit superclass calls in all classes , i.e use <span style="background-color:yellow;">A.__init__</span> in class <span style="background-color:yellow;">B</span> . </p>
<p>When there is no diamond inheritance I think super ( ) does n't have much advantage. The problem is , however , that you do n't know in advance if you will get into any diamond inheritance in the future so in that case it would be wise to use super ( ) anyway ( but then use it consistently ) . Otherwise you would end up having to change all classes at a later time or <span style="background-color:yellow;">run</span> into problems . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p><span style="background-color:yellow;">Boils</span> down to.. . </p>
<p>if you ca n't program consistiently and have no idea how multiple inheritence works then yes , super should be avoided. Not to mention , if you like fragile code and maintenance headaches then super should be avoided. If you like believe you have a crystal ball and forever know every possible use of you class , avoid using super . </p>
<p><span style="background-color:yellow;">At</span> this point , people who avoid super should avoid ever sharing code with anyone. Please do n't punish the general public because of FUD and general ignorance . </p>
