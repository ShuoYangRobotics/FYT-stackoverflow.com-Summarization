<h3>Question ( ID-5938309 ) : </h3><h2>" sorted 1-d iterator " based on " 2-d iterator " ( Cartesian product of iterators ) </h2><p>I 'm looking for a clean way to do this in Python : </p>
<p>Let 's say I have two iterators " iter1 " and " iter2 " : perhaps a prime <span style="background-color:yellow;">number</span> generator , and <span style="background-color:yellow;">itertools.count</span> ( ) . I know a priori that both are are infinite and monotonically <span style="background-color:yellow;">increasing.</span> Now I want to take some simple operation of two args " op " ( perhaps <span style="background-color:yellow;">operator.add</span> or <span style="background-color:yellow;">operator.mul</span> ) , and calculate every element of the first iterator with every element of the <span style="background-color:yellow;">next</span> , using said operation , then yield them one at a time , sorted. Obviously , this is an infinite sequence itself. ( As mentioned in comment by @ RyanThompson : this would be called the Cartesian Product of these sequences... or , more exactly , the 1d-sort of that product. ) </p>
<p>What is the best way to : </p>
<ul>wrap-up " iter1 " , " iter2 " , and " op " in an iterable that itself yields the <span style="background-color:yellow;">values</span> in monotonically <span style="background-color:yellow;">increasing</span> output . </ul>
<p>Allowable simplifying assumptions : </p>
<ul>If it helps , we can assume op ( a,b ) &gt ; = a and op ( a,b ) &gt ; = b . If it helps , we can assume op ( a,b ) &gt ; op ( a,c ) for all b &gt ; c . </ul>
<p>Also allowable : </p>
<ul>Also acceptable would be an iterator that yields <span style="background-color:yellow;">values</span> in " generally <span style="background-color:yellow;">increasing</span> " order... by which I mean the iterable could occasionally give me a <span style="background-color:yellow;">number</span> less than a previous one , but it would somehow make " side information " available ( as via a method on the object ) that would say " I 'm <span style="background-color:yellow;">not</span> guarenteeing the <span style="background-color:yellow;">next</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">value</span> I give you will be greater than the one I just gave you , but I AM SURE that all future <span style="background-color:yellow;">values</span> will at least be greater than N. " .... and " N " itself is monotonically <span style="background-color:yellow;">increasing</span> . </ul>
<p>The only way I can think to do this is a sort of " diagonalization " process , where I keep an <span style="background-color:yellow;">increasing</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">number</span> of partially processed iterables around , and " look ahead " for the minimum of all the possible <span style="background-color:yellow;">next</span> ( ) <span style="background-color:yellow;">values</span> , and yield that. But this weird agglomeration of a <span style="background-color:yellow;">heapq</span> and a bunch of deques just seems outlandish , even before I start to code it . </p>
<p>Please : do <span style="background-color:yellow;">not</span> base your answer on the fact that my examples mentioned primes or count ( ) .... I have several uses for this very concept that are NOT <span style="background-color:yellow;">related</span> to primes and count ( ) . </p>
<hr />
<p>UPDATE : OMG ! What a great discussion ! And some great answers with <span style="background-color:yellow;">really</span> thorough explanations. Thanks so much. StackOverflow <span style="background-color:yellow;">rocks</span> ; you guys <span style="background-color:yellow;">rock</span> . </p>
<p>I 'm going to delve in to each answer more thoroughly soon , and give the sample code a kick in the tires. From what I 've <span style="background-color:yellow;">read</span> so far , my original suspicions are confirmed that there is <span style="background-color:yellow;">no</span> " simple Python idiom " to do this. Rather , by one way or another , I ca <span style="background-color:yellow;">n't</span> escape keeping all yielded <span style="background-color:yellow;">values</span> of iter1 and iter2 around indefinitely . </p>
<p>FWIW : here 's an official " test case " if you want to try your solutions . </p>
<pre><code>import operator

def powers_of_ten():
    n = 0
    while True:
        yield 10**n
        n += 1

        n += 1

iter1 = powers_of_ten()
iter2 = series_of_nines()

</code></pre>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>Define the sequences as : </p>
<pre><code>a1 <= a2 <= a3 ...
b1 <= b2 <= b3 ...
</code></pre>
<p>Let a1b1 mean op ( a1,b1 ) for short . </p>
<p>Based on your allowable assumptions ( very important ) you know the following : </p>
<pre><code>max(a1, b1) <= a1b1 <= a1b2 <= a1b3 ...
   <=
max(a2, b1) <= a2b1 <= a2b2 <= a2b3 ...
   <=
max(a3, b1) <= a3b1 <= a3b2 <= a3b3 ...

    .      .
    .       .

<p>You 'll have to do something like : </p>
<p>Generate a1b1 . You know that if you continue <span style="background-color:yellow;">increasing</span> the b variables , you will only get higher <span style="background-color:yellow;">values.</span> The question <span style="background-color:yellow;">now</span> is : is there a smaller <span style="background-color:yellow;">value</span> by <span style="background-color:yellow;">increasing</span> the a variables ? Your lower bound is min ( a1 , b1 ) , so you will have to increase the a <span style="background-color:yellow;">values</span> until min ( ax,b1 ) &gt ; = a1b1 . Once you hit that point , you can find the smallest <span style="background-color:yellow;">value</span> from anb1 where 1 &lt ; = <span style="background-color:yellow;">n</span> &lt ; = x and yield that safely . </p>
<p>You then will have multiple horizontal chains that you 'll have to keep track of. Every time you have a <span style="background-color:yellow;">value</span> that goes past min ( ax,b1 ) , you 'll have to increase x ( adding more chains ) until min ( ax,b1 ) is larger than it before safely emitting it . </p>
<p>Just a starting point... I do <span style="background-color:yellow;">n't</span> have time to code it at the moment . </p>
<p>EDIT : Oh heh that 's exactly what you already had. Well , without more info , this is all you can do , as I 'm pretty sure that mathematically , that 's what is <span style="background-color:yellow;">necessary</span> . </p>
<p>EDIT2 : As for your 'acceptable ' solution : you can just yield a1bn in <span style="background-color:yellow;">increasing</span> order of <span style="background-color:yellow;">n</span> , <span style="background-color:yellow;">returning</span> min ( a1,b1 ) as N = P. You 'll <span style="background-color:yellow;">need</span> to be more specific. You speak as if you have a heuristic of what you generally want to see , the general way you want to progress through both iterables , but without telling us what it is I do <span style="background-color:yellow;">n't</span> know how one could do better . </p>

<p>UPDATE : Winston 's is good but makes an assumption that the poster did <span style="background-color:yellow;">n't</span> mention : that op ( a,c ) &gt ; op ( b,c ) if b&gt ; a . However , we do know that op ( a,b ) &gt ; = a and op ( a,b ) &gt ; = b . </p>

<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>So you basically want to take two monotonically <span style="background-color:yellow;">increasing</span> sequences , and then ( lazily ) compute the multiplication ( or addition , or another operation ) table between them , which is a 2-D array. Then you want to put the elements of that 2-D array in sorted order and iterate through them . </p>
<p>In general , this is impossible. However , if your sequences and operation are such that you can make certain guarantees about the <span style="background-color:yellow;">rows</span> and <span style="background-color:yellow;">columns</span> of the table , then you can make some progress. For example , let 's assume that your sequences are monitonically-increasing sequences of positive integers only , and that the operation is multiplication ( as in your example ) . In this case , we know that every <span style="background-color:yellow;">row</span> and column of the array is a monotonically-increasing sequence. In this case , you do <span style="background-color:yellow;">not</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">need</span> to compute the entire array , but <span style="background-color:yellow;">rather</span> only parts of it. Specifically , you must keep track of the following : </p>
<ul>How many <span style="background-color:yellow;">rows</span> you have ever used The <span style="background-color:yellow;">number</span> of elements you have taken from each <span style="background-color:yellow;">row</span> that you have used Every element from either input sequence that you have ever used , plus one more from each </ul>
<p>To compute the <span style="background-color:yellow;">next</span> element in your iterator , you must do the following : </p>
<ul>For each <span style="background-color:yellow;">row</span> that you have ever used , compute the " <span style="background-color:yellow;">next</span> " <span style="background-color:yellow;">value</span> in that <span style="background-color:yellow;">row.</span> For example , if you have used 5 <span style="background-color:yellow;">values</span> from <span style="background-color:yellow;">row</span> 1 , then compute the 6th <span style="background-color:yellow;">value</span> ( i = 1 , j = 6 ) by taking the 1st <span style="background-color:yellow;">value</span> from the first sequence and the 6th <span style="background-color:yellow;">value</span> from the second sequence ( both of which you have cached ) and applying the operation ( multiplication ) to them. Also , compute the first <span style="background-color:yellow;">value</span> in the first unused <span style="background-color:yellow;">row</span> . Take the minimum of all the <span style="background-color:yellow;">values</span> you computed. Yield this <span style="background-color:yellow;">value</span> as the <span style="background-color:yellow;">next</span> element in your iterator Increment the counter for the <span style="background-color:yellow;">row</span> from which you sampled the element in the previous step. If you took the element from a <span style="background-color:yellow;">new</span> , unused <span style="background-color:yellow;">row</span> , you must increment the count of the <span style="background-color:yellow;">number</span> of <span style="background-color:yellow;">rows</span> you have used , and you must create a <span style="background-color:yellow;">new</span> counter for that <span style="background-color:yellow;">row</span> initialized to 1. If <span style="background-color:yellow;">necessary</span> , you must also compute more <span style="background-color:yellow;">values</span> of one or both input sequences . </ul>
<p>This process is kind of complex , and in particular <span style="background-color:yellow;">notice</span> that to compute N <span style="background-color:yellow;">values</span> , you must in the worst case save an amount of state proportional to the square <span style="background-color:yellow;">root</span> of N. ( Edit : sqrt ( N ) is actually the best case. ) This is in stark contrast to a typical generator , which only <span style="background-color:yellow;">requires</span> constant space to iterate through its elements <span style="background-color:yellow;">regardless</span> of length . </p>
<p>In summary , you can do this under certain assumptions , and you can provide a generator-like interface to it , but it can <span style="background-color:yellow;">not</span> be done in a " streaming " fashion , because you <span style="background-color:yellow;">need</span> to save a lot of state in order to iterate through the elements in the correct order . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>Let me start with an example of how I would solve this intuitively . </p>
<p>Because <span style="background-color:yellow;">reading</span> code inline is a little tedious , I 'll introduce some <span style="background-color:yellow;">notation</span> : </p>
<h1>Notation </h1>
<ul>
<li><em>i1</em> will represent <code>iter1</code>. <em>i1</em><sub>0</sub> will represent the first element of <code>iter1</code>. Same for <code>iter2</code>.</li>
<li>※ will represent the <code>op</code> operator</li>
</ul>
<h1>Intuitive solution </h1>
<p>By using simplifying assumption 2, we know that <em>i1</em><sub>0</sub> ※ <em>i2</em><sub>0</sub> is the smallest element that will ever be yielded from your final iterator. The next element would the smaller of <em>i1</em><sub>0</sub> ※ <em>i2</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>i1</em><sub>1</sub> ※ <em>i2</em><sub>0</sub>.</p>
<p></p>
<h1>Expression as traversal of a DAG </h1>
<p>What you have here is a graph traversal problem. First, think of the problem as a tree. The root of the tree is <em>i1</em><sub>0</sub> ※ <em>i2</em><sub>0</sub>. This node, and each node below it, has two children. The two children of <em>i1</em><sub>x</sub> ※ <em>i2</em><sub>y</sub> are the following: One child is <em>i1</em><sub>x+1</sub> ※ <em>i2</em><sub>y</sub>, and the other child is <em>i1</em><sub>x</sub> ※ <em>i2</em><sub>y+1</sub>. Based on your second assumption, we know that <em>i1</em><sub>x</sub> ※ <em>i2</em><sub>y</sub> is less than both of its children.</p>
<p>( In fact , as Ryan mentions in a comment , this is a directed acyclic graph , or DAG. Some " parents " share " children " with other " parent " <span style="background-color:yellow;">nodes.</span> ) </p>
<p>Now , we <span style="background-color:yellow;">need</span> to keep a frontier - a collection of <span style="background-color:yellow;">nodes</span> that could be <span style="background-color:yellow;">next</span> to be <span style="background-color:yellow;">returned.</span> After <span style="background-color:yellow;">returning</span> a <span style="background-color:yellow;">node</span> , we add both its children to the frontier. To select the <span style="background-color:yellow;">next</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">node</span> to visit ( and <span style="background-color:yellow;">return</span> from your <span style="background-color:yellow;">new</span> iterator ) , we compare the <span style="background-color:yellow;">values</span> of all the <span style="background-color:yellow;">nodes</span> in the frontier. We take the <span style="background-color:yellow;">node</span> with the smallest <span style="background-color:yellow;">value</span> and we <span style="background-color:yellow;">return</span> it. Then , we again add both of its child <span style="background-color:yellow;">nodes</span> to the frontier. If the child is already in the frontier ( added as the child of some other parent ) , just ignore it . </p>
<h1>Storing the frontier </h1>
<p>Because you are primarily interested in the <span style="background-color:yellow;">value</span> of the <span style="background-color:yellow;">nodes</span> , it makes sense to store these <span style="background-color:yellow;">nodes</span> indexed by <span style="background-color:yellow;">value.</span> As such , it may be in your interest to use a dict . Keys in this dict should be the <span style="background-color:yellow;">values</span> of <span style="background-color:yellow;">nodes.</span> Values in this dict should be lists containing individual <span style="background-color:yellow;">nodes.</span> Because the only identifying information in a <span style="background-color:yellow;">node</span> is the pair of operands , you can store individual <span style="background-color:yellow;">nodes</span> as a two-tuple of operands . </p>
<p>In practice , after a few iterations , your frontier may look like the following : </p>
<pre><code>>>> frontier
{1: [(2, 3), (2, 4)], 2: [(3, 5), (5, 4)], 3: [(1, 6)], 4: [(6, 3)]}
</code></pre>
<h1>Other implementation <span style="background-color:yellow;">notes</span> </h1>
<p>Because iterators do <span style="background-color:yellow;">n't</span> support <span style="background-color:yellow;">random</span> access , you 'll <span style="background-color:yellow;">need</span> to hang on to <span style="background-color:yellow;">values</span> that are produced by your first two iterators until they are <span style="background-color:yellow;">no</span> longer <span style="background-color:yellow;">needed.</span> You 'll know that a <span style="background-color:yellow;">value</span> is still <span style="background-color:yellow;">needed</span> if it is <span style="background-color:yellow;">referenced</span> by any <span style="background-color:yellow;">value</span> in your frontier. You 'll know that a <span style="background-color:yellow;">value</span> is <span style="background-color:yellow;">no</span> longer <span style="background-color:yellow;">needed</span> once all <span style="background-color:yellow;">nodes</span> in the frontier <span style="background-color:yellow;">reference</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">values</span> later/greater than one you 've stored. For example , i1 20 is <span style="background-color:yellow;">no</span> longer <span style="background-color:yellow;">needed</span> when <span style="background-color:yellow;">nodes</span> in your frontier <span style="background-color:yellow;">reference</span> only i1 21 , i1 25 , i1 33 , .. . </p>
<p>As mentioned by Ryan , each <span style="background-color:yellow;">value</span> from each iterator will be used an infinite <span style="background-color:yellow;">number</span> of times. Thus , every <span style="background-color:yellow;">value</span> produced will <span style="background-color:yellow;">need</span> to be saved . </p>
<h1>Not practical </h1>
<p>Unfortunately , in order to assure that elements are <span style="background-color:yellow;">returned</span> only in <span style="background-color:yellow;">increasing</span> order , the frontier will grow without bound. Your memoized <span style="background-color:yellow;">values</span> will probably also take a significant amount of space also grow without bound. This may be something you can address by making your problem less general , but this should be a good starting point . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Use generators , which are just iterators written as functions that yield <span style="background-color:yellow;">results.</span> In this case you can write generators for iter1 and iter2 and another generator to wrap them and yield their <span style="background-color:yellow;">results</span> ( or do calculations with them , or the history of their <span style="background-color:yellow;">results</span> ) as you go . </p>
<p>From my <span style="background-color:yellow;">reading</span> of the question you want something like this , which will calculate every element of the first iterator with every element of the <span style="background-color:yellow;">next</span> , using said operation , you also state you want some way to wrap-up " iter1 " , " iter2 " , and " op " in an iterable that itself yields the <span style="background-color:yellow;">values</span> in monotonically <span style="background-color:yellow;">increasing</span> output . I propose generators offer a simple solution to such problem . </p>

    D, q = {}, 2

<p>Generators offer a lot of flexibility , so it should be fairly easy to write iter1 and iter2 as generators that <span style="background-color:yellow;">return</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">values</span> you want in the order you want. You could also consider using coroutines , which let you send <span style="background-color:yellow;">values</span> into a generator . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>Discussion in other answers observes that there is potentially infinite storage <span style="background-color:yellow;">required</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">no</span> matter what the algorithm , since every a [ <span style="background-color:yellow;">n</span> ] must <span style="background-color:yellow;">remain</span> available for each <span style="background-color:yellow;">new</span> b [ <span style="background-color:yellow;">n</span> ] . If you <span style="background-color:yellow;">remove</span> the <span style="background-color:yellow;">restriction</span> that the input be two iterators and instead only <span style="background-color:yellow;">require</span> that they be sequences ( indexable or merely something that can be <span style="background-color:yellow;">regenerated</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">repeatedly</span> ) then I believe all of your state suddenly collapses to one <span style="background-color:yellow;">number</span> : The last <span style="background-color:yellow;">value</span> you <span style="background-color:yellow;">returned.</span> Knowing the last <span style="background-color:yellow;">result</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">value</span> you can search the output space looking for the <span style="background-color:yellow;">next</span> one. ( If you want to emit duplicates properly then you may <span style="background-color:yellow;">need</span> to also track the <span style="background-color:yellow;">number</span> of times the <span style="background-color:yellow;">result</span> has been <span style="background-color:yellow;">returned</span> ) </p>
<p>With a pair of sequences you have a simple <span style="background-color:yellow;">recurrence</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">relation</span> : </p>
<pre><code>result(n) = f(seq1, seq1, result(n-1))
</code></pre>
<p>where f ( seq1 , seq1 , p ) searches for the minimum <span style="background-color:yellow;">value</span> in the output space q such that q &gt ; p . In practical terms you 'd probably make the sequences memoized functions and choose your search algorithm to avoid thrashing the pool of memoized items . </p>
