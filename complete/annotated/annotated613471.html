<h3>Question ( ID-613471 ) : </h3><h2>Discovering public IP programatically </h2><p>I 'm behind a router , I need a simple command to discover my public ip ( instead of googling what 's my ip and clicking one the results ) </p>
<p>Are there any standard protocols for this ? I 've heard about STUN but I do n't know how can I use it ? </p>
<p>P.S. I 'm planning on writing a short python script to do it </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-8 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>I have made a program that connects to http : //whatismyip.com/automation/n09230945.asp it is is written in D an getting someone else to tell you what they see your ip as is probably the most reliable way : </p>
<pre><code>/*
    Get my IP address
*/


import tango.net.http.HttpGet;
import tango.io.Stdout;

void main()
{
      try
      {
          auto page = new HttpGet ("http://whatismyip.com/automation/n09230945.asp");
          Stdout(cast(char[])page.read);
      }
      catch(Exception ex)
      {
          Stdout("An exception occurred");
      }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Edit python code should be like : </p>
<pre><code>from urllib import urlopen
print urlopen('http://whatismyip.com/automation/n09230945.asp').read()
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>Whenever I wanted to do this , I would just scrape whatismyip.org . When you go to the site , it gives you your plain text public IP. Plain and simple . </p>
<p>Just have your script access that site and read the IP . </p>
<p>I do n't know if you were implying this in your post or not , but it is n't possible to get your public IP from your own computer. It has to come from an external source . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>Targeting www.whatsmyip.org is rude. They plea not to do that on the page . </p>
<p>Only a system on the same level of NAT as your target will see the same IP . For instance , your application may be behind multiple layers of NAT ( this happens more as you move away from the US , where the glut of IPs are ) . </p>
<p>STUN is indeed the best method . In general , you should be planning to run a ( STUN ) server somewhere that you application can ask : do not hard code other people 's servers. You have to code to send some specific messages as described in rfc5389 . </p>
<p>I suggest a good read of , and related links . http : //www.ietf.org/html.charters/behave-charter.html </p>
<p>You may prefer to look at IPv6 , and Teredo to make sure that you always have IPv6 access . ( Microsoft Vista makes this very easy , I 'm told ) </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>This may be the easiest way. Parse the output of the following commands : </p>
<ol>run a traceroute to find a router that is less than 3 hops out from your machine . run ping with the option to record the source route and parse the output. The first IP address in the recorded route is your public one . </ol>
<p>For example , I am on a Windows machine , but the same idea should work from unix too . </p>
<pre><code>> tracert -d www.yahoo.com

Tracing route to www-real.wa1.b.yahoo.com [69.147.76.15]
over a maximum of 30 hops:

<p>The 68.85.228.121 is a Comcast ( my provider ) router. We can ping that : </p>
<pre><code>> ping -r 9 68.85.228.121 -n 1

Pinging 68.85.228.121 with 32 bytes of data:

Reply from 68.85.228.121: bytes=32 time=10ms TTL=253
    Route: 66.176.38.51 ->
           68.85.228.121 ->
           68.85.228.121 ->
           192.168.14.203
</code></pre>
<p>Voila ! The 66.176.38.51 is my public IP . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Your simplest way may be to ask some server on the outside of your <span style="background-color:yellow;">network</span> . </p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is that different destinations may see a different address for you. The router may be multihomed. And really that 's just where problems begin . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>If the <span style="background-color:yellow;">network</span> has an UpNp server running on the gateway you are able to talk to the gateway and ask it for your outside IP address . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>As mentioned by several people , STUN is indeed the proper solution . </p>
<ul>a list of public STUN servers a free software STUN client The STUN standard </ul>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>another cheeky way : if your router has got the option to update it 's web IP on dyndns , you can get your own IP with something like : </p>
<p>IP = ` resolveip -s myalias.dyndns-home.com ` </p>
