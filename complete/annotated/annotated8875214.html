<h3>Question ( ID-8875214 ) : </h3><h2>How can I <span style="background-color:yellow;">name</span> a block of code in Python so I can execute it multiple times by calling that <span style="background-color:yellow;">name</span> ? </h2><p>I have some code that is basically 5 print statements that i would like to call several times throughout the script. I was thinking I could save some space and make the code easier to maintain if I wrote the code once , then called it later. A function would work but it prints None after it is done and that is annoying. Any suggestions ? </p>
<p>Here is kinda what I am trying to do.. . </p>
<pre><code>name = "Bob"
House = "HOME"

print "hello,"
print name
print house
print "is where you are"
</code></pre>
<p>That is just an example , it is way more complicated than that , but i would like to put all of the print statements into a <span style="background-color:yellow;">named</span> " bucket " of sorts and then call that bucket . </p>
<p>And some of the code would not just be print statements , but also if statements as well . </p>
<p>Thanks in advance ! </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-6 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>If it prints None it is probably because you 're printing the result of the function , as well as letting the function print expressions . </p>
<p>e.g . </p>
<pre><code>def print_stuff():
    print "Hello, World"

print print_stuff()
> Hello, World
> None

# But print_stuff prints stuff, so you don't need to print it too:

print_stuff()
> Hello, World
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>A function works - </p>
<p>A function does not " print None " - a function , without an explicit return statement returns " None " implicitly - and if you call it on the interactive shell , the __repr__ of the returned None is printed to the console . </p>
<p>If youc all a function in a running program , the value returned , which is the result of of evaluating the expression that is the function call , does not print anything , just as inserting a line like 2 + 2 in th emidle of the code wo n't print anything . </p>
<p>So , for your lines above , you can just do : </p>
<pre><code>def printer(name, house):
    print "hello,"
    print name
    print house
    print "is where you are"

printer("Bob", "Home")
</code></pre>
<p>And re-use it with as may calls to " <span style="background-color:yellow;">printer</span> " as you want . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>Yes , it 's called a function . </p>
<pre><code>def foo(name, house):
    print 'hello,', name, house, 'is where you are'

foo('bob', 'home')
</code></pre>
<p>Function does n't print anything that you do n't print inside it . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>I think you can do that with a function ( would be the obvious way to do ) , and I do n't usually see None being printed after execution of functions containing print. In this case , probably you do n't need a return statement : </p>
<pre><code>def printblock(name, house):
    print "hello,"
    print name
    print house
    print "is where you are"

printblock("Bob", "HOME")
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><pre><code>def hello(name, house):
    print "hello,"
    print name
    print house
    print "is where you are"
    return

hello("Bob", "Home")
</code></pre>
<p>This is a standard python function. It should n't print anything unless you explicitly tell it to . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><pre><code>>>> from string import Template
>>> x=Template('Hello \n$name \n$house \nis where you are')
>>> name='bob'
>>> house='here'
>>> print x.safe_substitute(name=name,house=house)
Hello
bob
here
is where you are
</code></pre>
<p>Hi there , as i recall from your question that you would need to use it several times , you may use the Template functionality of Python. you may kep all your variable in a list or dictionary and call the above given print statement using the for loop . </p>
<p>hope this helps , also explore the the template function. thank you : ) </p>
