<h3>Question ( ID-992076 ) : </h3><h2>I 'm new at python , building a <span style="background-color:yellow;">high</span> <span style="background-color:yellow;">low</span> game. I need some help ! </h2><p>Make the computer guess a number that the user chooses between 1 and 1000 in no more than 10 guesses.This assignment uses an algorithm called a binary search. After each guess , the algorithm cuts the number of possible answers to search in half. Pseudocode for the complete program is given below ; your task is to turn it into a working python program . The program should start by printing instructions to the screen , explaining that the user should pick a number between 1 and 1000 and the computer will guess it in no more than 10 tries. It then starts making guesses , and after each guess it asks the user for feedback . The user should be instructed to enter -1 if the guess needs to be <span style="background-color:yellow;">lower</span> , 0 if it was right , and 1 if it needs to be <span style="background-color:yellow;">higher.When</span> the program guesses correctly , it should report how many guesses were required. If the user enters an invalid response , the instructions should be repeated and the user allowed to try again . </p>
<p>Pseudocode </p>
<pre><code>- Print instructions to the user  
-Start with high = 1000, low = 1, and tries = 1 
- While high is greater than low   
  - Guess the average of high and low  
  - Ask the user to respond to the guess  
  - Handle the four possible outcomes:  
    - If the guess was right, print a message that tries guesses were required and quit the program
    - If the guess was too high, set high to one less than the guess that was displayed to the user and increment tries  
    - If the guess was too low, set low to one more than the guess that was displayed to the user and increment tries
    - If the user entered an incorrect value, print out the instructions again
- high and low must be equal, so print out the answer and the value of tries
</code></pre>
<p>I need some serious help ! I do n't understand any of this stuff at all ! This is all I have </p>
<pre><code>def main(x, nums, low, high):
        input("Enter -1 if the guess needs to be lower, 0 if the guess was right, or 1 if the guess needs to be higher: ")
    for i in range (1, 1001):

main()
</code></pre>
<p>and I do n't even know if it 's right ! </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-7 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>Before thinking about how to implement this in python ( or any language ) lets look at the pseudocode , which looks like a pretty good plan to solve the problem . </p>
<p>I would guess that one thing you might be getting stuck on is the way the pseudocode references variables , like <span style="background-color:yellow;">high</span> and <span style="background-color:yellow;">low</span> . The way to understand variables is to consider them slots that values can be stored. At any given time , a variable has some value , like the number 5 , or a reference to an open file. That value can be summoned at any time by using its name , or it can be given a new value by assigning to it , and the old value will be forgotten with the new value taking its place . </p>
<p>The pseudocode references three variables , <span style="background-color:yellow;">high</span> , <span style="background-color:yellow;">low</span> and tries . It also tells you what their initial values should be. After the second line has executed , those values are set to 1000 , 1 and 1 , respectively , but they take on new values as the program progresses . </p>
<p>Another feature of the pseudocode is a conditional loop , and a case analysis of the user input. Your translation of the pseudocode 's loop is incorrect. In your case , you have created a new variable , i and have instructed your program to run the loop body with every value of i between 1 and 1000. Obviously this does n't have a whole lot to do with the pseudocode . </p>
<p>Instead what you want to do is loop forever , until some condition ( which changes in the loop body ) becomes false. In python , the while statement does this. If you 're familiar with an if statement , while looks the same , but after the body is done , the condition is re-evaluated and the body is executed again if it is still true . </p>
<p>Finally , the case analysis in the body of the loop requires comparing something to expected values. Although some other languages have a number of ways of expressing this , in python we only have if - elif - else clauses . </p>
<p></p>
<p>Outside of transforming pseudocode to working code , it is probably useful to understand what the program is actually doing. The key here is on line 4 , where the program guesses the average of two values. after that the program acts on how well the guess worked out . </p>
<p>In the first run through the loop , with <span style="background-color:yellow;">high</span> containing 1000 and <span style="background-color:yellow;">low</span> containing 1 , the average is 500 ( actually the average is 500.5 , but since we 're averaging whole numbers , python guesses that we want the result of the division to also be an integer ) . Obviously that guess has only a 0.1 % chance of being right , but if it 's wrong , the user is expected to tell us if it was too <span style="background-color:yellow;">high</span> , or too <span style="background-color:yellow;">low.</span> Either way , that answer completely eliminates 50 % of the possible guesses . </p>
<p>If , for instance , the user was thinking of a <span style="background-color:yellow;">low</span> number , then when the program guessed 500 , the user would tell the program that 500 was too <span style="background-color:yellow;">high</span> , and then the program would n't ever have to guess that the number was in the range of 501 thru 1000. That can save the computer a lot of work . </p>
<p>To put that information to use , the program keeps track of the range of possible values the goal number could be. When the number guessed is too <span style="background-color:yellow;">high</span> , the program adjusts its upper bound downward , just below the guess , and if the guess was too <span style="background-color:yellow;">low</span> , the program adjusts its <span style="background-color:yellow;">lower</span> bound upward to just above the guess . </p>
<p>When the program guesses again , the guess is right in the middle of the possible range , cutting the range in half again. The number of possible guesses went from the original 1000 to 500 in one guess , to 250 in two guesses. If the program has terrible luck , and ca n't get it two ( which is actually pretty likely ) , then by the third , it has only 125 numbers left to worry about. After the fourth guess , only 62 numbers remain in range. This continues , and after eight guesses , only 3 numbers remain , and the program tries the middle number for its ninth guess. If that turns out to be wrong , only one number is left , and the program guesses it ! </p>
<p>This technique of splitting a range in half and then continuing to the closer half is called bisection and appears in a wide range topics of interest to computer science . </p>

<p>How about some CODE ! Since i do n't want to deprive you of the learning experience , I 'll just give you some snippets that might help you along. python is a language designed for interactive exploration , so fire up your interpreter and give this a shot. I 'll be posting examples with the prompts shown , do n't actually type that . </p>
<p>Here 's an example using the while clause : </p>
<pre><code>>>> x = 1000
>>> while x > 1:
...     x = x/2
...     print x
...
500
250
125
62
31
15
7
3
1
>>> x
1
</code></pre>
<p>Getting console input from the user should be done through the raw_input ( ) function. It just returns whatever the user types. This is a little harder to show. To simplify things , after every line of python that requires input , I 'll type " Hello World ! " ( without the quotes ) </p>
<pre><code>>>> raw_input()
Hello World!
'Hello World!'
>>> y = raw_input()
Hello World!
>>> print y
Hello World!
>>>
</code></pre>
<p>How about some combining of concepts ! </p>
<pre><code>>>> myvar = ''
>>> while myvar != 'exit':
...     myvar = raw_input()
...     if myvar == 'apples':
...         print "I like apples"
...     elif myvar == 'bananas':
...         print "I don't like bananas"
...     else:
...         print "I've never eaten", myvar
...
apples
I like apples
mangoes
I've never eaten mangoes
bananas
I don't like bananas
exit
I've never eaten exit
>>>

<p>Oops. little bit of a bug there. See if you can fix it ! </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><blockquote>I do n't understand any of this stuff at all ! </blockquote>
<p>That 's pretty problematic , but , fine , let 's do one step at a time ! Your homework assignment begins : </p>
<blockquote>Print instructions to the user </blockquote>
<p>So you do n't understand ANY of the stuff , you say , so that means you do n't understand this part either. Well : " the user " is the person who 's running your program. " Instructions " are English sentences that tell him or her what to do to play the game , as per the following quote from this excellently clear and detailed assignment : </p>
<blockquote>The program should start by printing instructions to the screen , explaining that the user should pick a number between 1 and 1000 and the computer will guess it in no more than 10 tries . </blockquote>
<p>" print " is a Python instruction that emits information ; for example , try a program containing only </p>
<pre><code>print "some information"
</code></pre>
<p>to see how it works. OK , can you please edit your answer to show us that you 've gotten this point , so we can move to the next one ? Feel free to comment here with further questions if any words or concepts I 'm using are still too advanced for you , and I 'll try to clarify ! </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>You 're obviously very new to programming , and I guess that is one of the reasons for a delayed response from the community. It 's tough to decide where to start and how to guide you through this whole exercise . </p>
<p>So , before you get a good answer here that includes making you understand what 's happening there , and guiding you through building the solution yourself ( ideally ! ) I would suggest you visit this page to try to get a grasp of the actual problem itself . </p>
<p>http : //www.openbookproject.net/pybiblio/gasp/course/4-highlow.html </p>
<p>In the meantime , look at all the answers in this thread and keep editing your post so that we know you 're getting it . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>Okay , the nice part about using Python is that it 's almost pseudocode anyway . </p>
<p>Now , let 's think about the individual steps : </p>
<ol>How do you get the average between <span style="background-color:yellow;">high</span> and <span style="background-color:yellow;">low</span> ? How do you ask the user if the answerr is correct What do " if " statements look like in Python , and how would you write the pseudocode out as if statements ? </ol>
<p>Here 's another hint -- you can run python as an interpreter and try individual statements along , so , for example , you could do </p>
<pre><code>high=23
low=7
</code></pre>
<p>then compute what you think should be the average or midpoint between them ( hint : 15 ) </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Welcome to Stack Overflow ! </p>
<p>The trick here is to realize that your Python program should look almost like the pseudocode . </p>
<p>First let 's try to understand exactly what the pseudocode is doing. If we had to interact with the program described by the pseudocode , it would look something like this : </p>
<pre><code>Think of a number between 1 and 1000 and press Enter.
>>> 
Is it 500? Enter -1 if it's lower, 0 if I guessed right, or 1 if it's higher.
>>> 1
Is it 750? Enter -1 if it's lower, 0 if I guessed right, or 1 if it's higher.
>>> -1
Is it 625? Enter -1 if it's lower, 0 if I guessed right, or 1 if it's higher.
</code></pre>
<p>etc . </p>
<p>When we first think of our number , the program knows only that it is between 1 and 1000. It represents this knowledge by setting the variable 'low ' to 1 and the variable 'high ' to 1000. Its first guess is the average of these numbers , which is 500 . </p>
<p>After we tell the program that our number is greater than 500 , it updates the value of 'low ' to 501. In other words the program then knows that our number is between 501 and 1000. It then guesses the average of 501 and 1000 , which is 750. We tell it that our number is <span style="background-color:yellow;">lower</span> , so the program updates the value of 'high ' to 749 and guesses the average of 501 and 749 next , and so on until it guesses right , or it has narrowed the possible range down to a single number ( meaning its next guess will be right ) . </p>
<p>So back to writing the program in Python : We basically just translate the pseudocode line for line. For example our program loop should look just like it does in the pseucode : </p>
<pre><code>while high > low:
  # Guess (high + low) / 2 and ask user to respond
  # Handle user response
</code></pre>
<p>There is no need for a for-loop as you have in your code . </p>
<p>To take input we can do something like this : </p>
<pre><code>guess = (high + low) / 2
response = input('Is it ' + str(guess) + '? Enter -1 if it's lower, 0 if I guessed right, or 1 if it's higher.')
</code></pre>
<p>Now the user input is stored in the variable 'response ' , and we can handle the possibilities with if statements like 'if response = = -1 : ' for example . </p>
<p>Just remember to print the instructions and set 'high ' and 'low ' to their initial values before entering the while loop and you should be all set . </p>
<p>Good luck ! </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>Here 's a few hints to get you started : </p>
<p>Average = Value + Value + Value [ ... ] / Number of Values ; ( for instance , ( ( 2 + 5 + 3 ) / ( 3 ) ) </p>
<p>Many programming languages use different operator precedence. When I am programming , I always use parentheses when I am unsure about operator precedence. In my example above , if you only did 2 + 5 + 3 / 3 , the program would do division operations before addition - so it would evaulate to 2 + 5 + ( 3 / 3 ) , or 2 + 5 + 1 = = 7 . </p>
<p>Skip this for python users / * Secondly : your earliest programs can benefit from const correctness ( here is a good explanation of what it is and why it is EXTREMELY good practice ) . Please read through that and understand why you should use constants ( or whatever the python equivalent is ) . Also look up " magic numbers , " which is a big area where constants are used . * / </p>
<p>Google " Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally " ( NOTE : this only deals with mathematical operators , and mostly holds true for programming languages ; for a more comprehensive study of operator precedence , look up your chosen language 's documentation for precedence - also note that most programs do n't have built in power operators , but most standard libraries have pow functions ) . </p>
<p>Speaking of standard library : Get acquainted with standard library functions ( I have never used Python , I do n't know how it implements a SL , but I would be extremely surprised if a language that popular did n't have a well developed SL ) . If you do n't know what that is , and your book/tutorial does n't have it , get a new one. Any resource that does n't reference a standard library is not worth the time . </p>
<p>Lastly : while this post may look like I know what I 'm talking about , I really am still in the early phases of learning , just like you. A few things you might want to get used to early on ( when I skipped these parts , it slowed my learning a lot ) : The use of references and pointers ( Q for comments : does Python have pointers ? ) , the difference between the data IN a memory location and the actual memory location ( often times , the location of the value in memory will be more useful than the value itself , at least when writing data structures ) . Especially get used to the standard library ; look for copy , find , etc. type functions useful in string manipulation . </p>
<p>Actually , rereading your original post , I did not realize this was a homework type assignment. If you are n't doing this for fun , you will probably never take my advice. Just remember that programming can be extremely fun , if you do n't make it a chore - and do n't get frustrated when your code does n't compile ( or...interpret ) , or you get unexpected results , etc . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>Does n't match the psudocode exactly but it works. lol ; ) </p>
<p>I know this is a wicked old post but this is the same assignment I got also. Here is what I ended up with : </p>
<pre><code>high = 1000
low = 1
print "Pick a number between 1 and 1000."
print "I will guess your number in 10 tries or less."
print "Or at least i'll try to.  ;)"
print "My first guess is 500."
guess = 500
tries = 0
answer = 1
print "Enter 1 if it's higher."
print "Enter -1 if it's lower."
print "Enter 0 if I guessed it!"
print ""
while (answer != 0):
    answer = int(raw_input("Am I close?"))
    if answer == 1:
        tries = tries + 1
        low = guess
        guess = (high + low) / 2
        print "My next guess is:"
        print guess
    elif answer == -1:
        tries = tries + 1
        high = guess
        guess = (high + low) / 2
        print "My next guess is:"
        print guess
    elif answer == 0:
        tries = tries + 1
        print "Your number is:"
        print guess
        print "Yay! I got it! Number of guesses:"
        print tries
