<h3>Question ( ID-973106 ) : </h3><h2>What is the clojure equivalent of the Python idiom " if __name__ = = '__main__ ' " ? </h2><p>I 'm dabbling in clojure and am having a little trouble trying to determine the clojure ( and / or Lisp ) equivalent of this common python idiom . </p>
<p>The idiom is that at the bottom of a python module there is often a bit of test code , and then a statement which runs the code , for example : </p>
<pre><code># mymodule.py
class MyClass(object):
    """Main logic / code for the library lives here"""
    pass

def _runTests():
    # Code which tests various aspects of MyClass...
    mc = MyClass() # etc...
    assert 2 + 2 == 4

if __name__ == '__main__': _runTests()
</code></pre>
<p>This is useful for simple , ad-hoc testing. One would normally use this module by writing from mymodule import <span style="background-color:yellow;">MyClass</span> , in which case <span style="background-color:yellow;">_runTests</span> ( ) is never called , but with the snippet at the end , one can also run it by typing python mymodule.py directly from the command line . </p>
<p>Is there an equivalent idiom in Clojure ( and/or common lisp ) ? I 'm not after a full-blown unit testing library ( well , I am , but not in this question ) , I 'd just like to include some code in a module which will only be run under some circumstances , so I can have a quick way to run code I 've been working on but still allow my file to be imported like a normal module / namespace . </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-7 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>It 's not idiomatic to run Clojure scripts over and over from the command line. The REPL is a better command line. Clojure being a Lisp , it 's common to fire up Clojure and leave the same instance running forever , and interact with it rather than restart it. You can change functions in the running instance one at a time , run them and poke them as needed. Escaping the tedious and slow traditional edit/compile/debug cycle is a great feature of Lisps . </p>
<p>You can easily write functions to do things like run unit tests , and just call those functions from the REPL whenever you want to run them and ignore them otherwise. It 's common in Clojure to use clojure.contrib.test-is , add your test functions to your namespace , then use clojure.contrib.test-is/run-tests to run them all . </p>
<p>Another good reason not to run Clojure from the commandline is that the startup time of the JVM can be prohibitive . </p>
<p>If you really want to run a Clojure script from the command line , there are a bunch of ways you can do it. See the Clojure mailing list for some discussion . </p>
<p>One way is to test for the presence of command line arguments. Given this foo.clj in the current directory : </p>
<pre><code>(ns foo)

(defn hello [x] (println "Hello," x))

(if *command-line-args*
  (hello "command line")
  (hello "REPL"))
</code></pre>
<p>You 'll get different behavior depending how you start Clojure . </p>
<pre><code>$ java -cp ~/path/to/clojure.jar:. clojure.main foo.clj --
Hello, command line
$ java -cp ~/path/to/clojure.jar:. clojure.main
Clojure 1.1.0-alpha-SNAPSHOT
user=> (use 'foo)
Hello, REPL
nil
user=>
</code></pre>
<p>See src/clj/clojure/main.clj in the Clojure source if you want to see how this is working . </p>
<p>Another way is to compile your code into .class files and invoke them from the Java command line. Given a source file foo.clj : </p>
<pre><code>(ns foo
  (:gen-class))

(defn hello [x] (println "Hello," x))

(defn -main [] (hello "command line"))
</code></pre>
<p>Make a directory to store the compiled .class files ; this defaults to ./classes . You must make this folder yourself , Clojure wo n't create it. Also make sure you set $ CLASSPATH to include ./classes and the directory with your source code ; I 'll assume foo.clj is in the current directory. So from the command line : </p>
<pre><code>$ mkdir classes
$ java -cp ~/path/to/clojure.jar:./classes:. clojure.main
Clojure 1.1.0-alpha-SNAPSHOT
user=> (compile 'foo)
foo
</code></pre>
<p>In the classes directory you will now have a bunch of .class files. To invoke your code from the command line ( running the -main function by default ) : </p>
<pre><code>$ java -cp ~/path/to/clojure.jar:./classes foo
Hello, command line.
</code></pre>
<p>There 's a lot of information about compiling Clojure code on clojure.org . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>I 'm very new to Clojure but I think this discussion on the Clojure groups may be a solution and/or workaround , specifically the post by Stuart Sierra on April 17th at 10 : 40 PM . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>In Common Lisp you can use conditional reading with features . </p>
<pre><code>#+testing (run-test 'is-answer-equal-42)
</code></pre>
<p>Above will only be read and thus execute during load if the list of features bound to cl : * features * will contain the symbol : testing . </p>
<p>For example </p>
<pre><code>(let ((*features* (cons :testing *features*)))
   (load "/foo/bar/my-answerlib.lisp"))
</code></pre>
<p>will temporarily add : testing to the list of features . </p>
<p>You can define your own features and control which expressions the Common Lisp system reads and which it skips . </p>
<p>Additionally you can also do : </p>
<pre><code>#-testing (print '|we are in production mode|)
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>There 's also a list of different possibilities at http : //rosettacode.org/wiki/Scripted_Main # Clojure . ( If you find a new one - please add it. ; - ) ) </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>You might want to have a look at the test-is library from clojure-contrib. It 's not the same idiom , but it should support a pretty similar workflow . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p></p>
<p>You should just create the library , add a testsuite to it ( there are many testing frameworks for Common Lisp ; I prefer the 5am framework , there is a survey of frameworks available here ) . And then you load the library , and in the REPL you can do anything with the library : run tests , call functions , experiment , etc . </p>
<p>When you find a failing test , you make a fix to it , recompile the changed code , and continue experimenting , running tests without restarting the whole application. This saves a lot of time , because the running application might have accumulated a lot of state ( it might have created gui windows , connected to databases , reached some critical moment that is not easily reproduceable ) , and you do n't have to restart it after every change . </p>
<p>Here 's an example for Common Lisp ( from my cl-sqlite library ) : </p>
<p>The code : </p>
<pre><code>(def-suite sqlite-suite)

(defun run-all-tests ()
  (run! 'sqlite-suite));'

(in-suite sqlite-suite)

(test test-connect
  (with-open-database (db ":memory:")))

(test test-disconnect-with-statements
  (finishes
    (with-open-database (db ":memory:")
      (prepare-statement db "create table users (id integer primary key, user_name text not null, age integer null)"))))
...
</code></pre>
<p>and the interactive session : </p>
<pre><code>CL-USER> (sqlite-tests:run-all-tests)
.......
 Did 7 checks.
    Pass: 7 (100%)
    Skip: 0 ( 0%)
    Fail: 0 ( 0%)

NIL
CL-USER> (defvar *db* (sqlite:connect ":memory:"))
*DB*
CL-USER> (sqlite:execute-non-query *db* "create table t1 (field text not null)")
; No value
CL-USER> (sqlite:execute-non-query *db* "insert into t1 (field) values (?)" "hello")
; No value
CL-USER> (sqlite:execute-to-list *db* "select * from t1")
(("hello"))
CL-USER>
</code></pre>
<p>Now suppose that I found bug in sqlite : execute-to-list. I go to the code of this function , fix the bug and recompile this function. Then I call the fixed function and ensure that it works. The in-memory database is not gone , it has the same state as it had before recompile . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>If you are talking about having an " entry point " you can certainly do that : </p>
<pre><code>(ns foo)

(defn foo [n]
  (inc n))

(defn main []
  (println "working")
  (println "Foo has ran:" (foo 1)))

(main)
</code></pre>
<p>what will happen now is that any time this code is ( load-file " foo.clj " ) 'd or ( use 'foo ) or ( require 'foo ) , then ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">main</span> ) will be called , that 's usually not done . </p>
<p>Much more common is that a file of code can be loaded at the REPL and then the <span style="background-color:yellow;">main</span> function would be called by the <span style="background-color:yellow;">user</span> . </p>
