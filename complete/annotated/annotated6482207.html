<h3>Question ( ID-6482207 ) : </h3><h2>What is meant by classes themselves are <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> ? </h2><p>I was Just reading about the python classes documentation,it says ,in python " classes themselves are <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> " .How is that different <span style="background-color:yellow;">from</span> C # or Java classes ? What advantageous and disadvantages this type of classes have compared with C # or Java ? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-7 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>In Python , classes are <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> in the sense that you can assign them to variables , pass them to <span style="background-color:yellow;">functions</span> , etc. just like any other <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects.</span> For example </p>
<pre><code>>>> t = type(10)
>>> t
<type 'int'>
>>> len(t.__dict__)
55
>>> t() # construct an int
0
>>> t(10)
10
</code></pre>
<p>Java has Class <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> which provide some information about a class , but you ca n't use them in place of explicit class names. They are n't really classes , just class information structures . </p>
<pre><code>Class C = x.getClass();
new C(); // won't work
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>Declaring a class is simply declaring a variable : </p>
<pre><code>class foo(object):
    def bar(self): pass
print foo # <class '__main__.foo'>
</code></pre>
<p>They can be assigned and stored like any variable : </p>
<pre><code>class foo(object):
    pass
class bar(object):
    pass
baz = bar # simple variable assignment
items = [foo, bar]
my_foo = items[0]() # creates a foo
for x in (foo, bar): # create one of each type
    print x()
</code></pre>
<p>and passed around as a variable : </p>
<pre><code>class foo(object):
    def __init__(self):
        print "created foo"
def func(f):
    f()

func(foo)
</code></pre>
<p>They can be created by <span style="background-color:yellow;">functions</span> , including the base class list : </p>
<pre><code>def func(base_class, var):
    class cls(base_class):
        def g(self):
            print var
    return cls

class my_base(object):
    def f(self): print "hello"

new_class = func(my_base, 10)
obj = new_class()
obj.f() # hello
obj.g() # 10
</code></pre>
<p>By contrast , while classes in Java have <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> representing them , eg. String.class , the class name itself--String--is n't an <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> and ca n't be manipulated as one. That 's inherent to statically-typed languages . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>In C # and Java the classes are not <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects.</span> They are types , in the sense in which those languages are statically typed. True you can <span style="background-color:yellow;">get</span> an <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> representing a specific class - but that 's not the same as the class itself . </p>
<p>In python what looks like a class is actually an <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> too . </p>
<p>It 's exlpained here much better than I can ever do : ) </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>The main difference is that they mean you can easily manipulate the class as an <span style="background-color:yellow;">object.</span> The same <span style="background-color:yellow;">facility</span> is available in Java , where you can use the methods of Class to <span style="background-color:yellow;">get</span> at information about the class of an <span style="background-color:yellow;">object.</span> In languages like Python , Ruby , and Smalltalk , the more dynamic nature of the language lets you " open " the class and change it , which is sometimes called " monkey patching " . </p>
<p>Personally I do n't think the differences are all that much of a big deal , but I 'm sure we can <span style="background-color:yellow;">get</span> a <span style="background-color:yellow;">good</span> religious war started about it . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Classes are <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> in that they are manipulable in Python code just like any <span style="background-color:yellow;">object.</span> Others have shown how you can pass them around to <span style="background-color:yellow;">functions</span> , allowing them to be operated upon like any <span style="background-color:yellow;">object.</span> Here is how you might do this : </p>
<pre><code>class Foo(object):
    pass

f = Foo()

f.a = "a"    # assigns attribute on instance f
Foo.b = "b"  # assigns attribute on class Foo, and thus on all instances including f

print f.a, f.b
</code></pre>
<p>Second , like all <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> , classes are instantiated at runtime. That is , a class definition is code that is executed rather than a structure that is compiled before anything runs. This means a class can " bake in " things that are only known when the program is run , such as environment variables or user input. These are evaluated once when the class is declared and then become a part of the class. This is different <span style="background-color:yellow;">from</span> compiled languages like C # which require this sort of behavior to be implemented differently . </p>
<p>Finally , classes , like any <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> , are built <span style="background-color:yellow;">from</span> classes. Just as an <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> is built <span style="background-color:yellow;">from</span> a class , so is a class built <span style="background-color:yellow;">from</span> a special kind of class called a metaclass. You can write your own metaclasses to change how classes are defined . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>Another advantage of classes being <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> is that <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> can change their class at runtime : </p>
<pre><code>>>> class MyClass(object):
...     def foo(self):
...         print "Yo There! I'm a MyCLass-Object!"
...
>>> class YourClass(object):
...     def foo(self):
...         print "Guess what?! I'm a YourClass-Object!"
...
>>> o = MyClass()
>>> o.foo()
Yo There! I'm a MyCLass-Object!
>>> o.__class__ = YourClass
>>> o.foo()
Guess what?! I'm a YourClass-Object!
</code></pre>
<p>Objects have a special attribute __class__ that points to the class of which they are an instance. This is possible only because classes are <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> themself , and therefore can be bound to an attribute like __class__ . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>As this question has a Smalltalk tag , this answer is <span style="background-color:yellow;">from</span> a Smalltalk perspective. In Object-Oriented programming , things <span style="background-color:yellow;">get</span> done through message-passing. You send a message to an <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> , if the <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> understands that message , it executes the corresponding method and returns a value. But how is the <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> created in the <span style="background-color:yellow;">first</span> place ? If special syntax is introduced <span style="background-color:yellow;">for</span> creating <span style="background-color:yellow;">objects</span> that will break the simple syntax based on message passing. This is what happens in languages like Java : </p>
<pre><code>p = new Point(10, 20); // Creates a new Point object with the help of a special keyword - new.
p.draw(); // Sends the message `draw` to the Point object.
</code></pre>
<p>As it is evident <span style="background-color:yellow;">from</span> the above code , the language has two ways to <span style="background-color:yellow;">get</span> things done - one imperative and the other Object Oriented. In contrast , Smalltalk has a consistent syntax based only on messaging : </p>
<pre><code>p := Point new: 10 y: 20.
p draw.
</code></pre>
<p>Here new is a message send to a singleton <span style="background-color:yellow;">object</span> called Point which is an instance of a Metaclass . In addition to <span style="background-color:yellow;">giving</span> the language a consistent model of computation , metaclasses allow dynamic modification of classes. For instance , the <span style="background-color:yellow;">following</span> statement will add a new instance variable to the Point class without requiring a recompilation or VM restart : </p>
<pre><code>Point addInstVarName: 'z'.
</code></pre>
