<h3>Question ( ID-2925174 ) : </h3><h2>Is there a way to convert code to a string and vice versa in Python ? </h2><p>The original question was : </p>
<p>Is there a way to declare macros in Python as they are declared in C : </p>
<pre><code>#define OBJWITHSIZE(_x) (sizeof _x)/(sizeof _x[0])
</code></pre>
<p>Here 's what I 'm trying to find out : </p>
<p>Is there a way to avoid code duplication in Python ? In one part of a program I 'm writing , I have a function : </p>
<pre><code>def replaceProgramFilesPath(filenameBr):
  def getProgramFilesPath():
    import os
    return os.environ.get("PROGRAMFILES") + chr(92)
  return filenameBr.replace("<ProgramFilesPath>",getProgramFilesPath() )
</code></pre>
<p>In another part , I 've got this code embedded in a string that will later be output to a python file that will itself be run : </p>
<pre><code>"""
def replaceProgramFilesPath(filenameBr):
  def getProgramFilesPath():
    import os
    return os.environ.get("PROGRAMFILES") + chr(92)
  return filenameBr.replace("<ProgramFilesPath>",getProgramFilesPath() )
"""
</code></pre>
<p>How can I build a " macro " that will avoid this duplication ? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-8 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>No , Python does not support preprocessor macros like C. Your example is n't something you would need to do in Python though ; you might consider providing a relevant example so people can suggest a Pythonic way to express what you need . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>While there does seem to be a library for python preprocessing called pypp , I am not entirely familiar with it. There really is no preprocessing capability for python built-in. Python code is translated into byte-code , there are no intermediate steps. If you are a beginner in python I would recommend avoiding pypp entirely . </p>
<p>The closest equivalent of macros might be to define a global function. The python equivalent to your C style macro might be : </p>
<pre><code>import sys
OBJWITHSIZE = lambda x: sys.getsizeof(x) / sys.getsizeof(x[0])
aList = [1, 2, 4, 5]
size = OBJWITHSIZE(aList)
print str(size)
</code></pre>
<p>Note that you would rarely ever need to get the <span style="background-color:yellow;">size</span> of a python object as all allocation and deletion are handled for you in python unless you are doing something quite strange . </p>
<p>Instead of using a lambda function you could also do this : </p>
<pre><code>import sys
def getSize(x):
   return sys.getsizeof(x) / sys.getsizeof(x[0])

OBJWITHSIZE = getSize
aList = [1, 2, 4, 5]
size = OBJWITHSIZE(aList)
print str(size)
</code></pre>
<p>Which is essentially the same . </p>
<p>As it has been previously mentioned , your example macro is redundant in python because you could simply write : </p>
<pre><code>aList = [1, 2, 4, 5]
size = len(aList)
print str(size)
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>This is not supported at the language level. In Python , you 'd usually use a normal function or a normal variable where you might use a # define in C . </p>
<br /><b># <span style="background-color:yellow;">3</span> </b><br /><p>Answering the new question . </p>
<p>In your <span style="background-color:yellow;">first</span> python file ( called , for example , <span style="background-color:yellow;">first.py</span> ) : </p>
<pre><code>import os

def replaceProgramFilesPath(filenameBr):
  new_path = os.environ.get("PROGRAMFILES") + chr(92)
  return filenameBr.replace("<ProgramFilesPath>", new_path)
</code></pre>
<p>In the second python file ( called , for example , second.py ) : </p>
<pre><code>from first import replaceProgramFilesPath
# now replaceProgramFilesPath can be used in this script.
</code></pre>
<p>Note that <span style="background-color:yellow;">first.py</span> will need to be in python 's search path for modules or the same directory as second.py for you to be able to do the import in second.py . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>You can do much more powerful things than C macros : you can do lisp macros ! You will need to use the ast package however , which can transform any python code into another python code ( in particular applying macros ) . It is , as lisp macros , much harder to use than C macros , require more knowledge about the language syntax itself , but they can make wonderful things . </p>
<p>You can see one example of a macro I 've made that makes any function traceable : printing all variables when they are set and printing every line before it is executed. The specs go more in details . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>Generally speaking if you want to convert string to python code , use eval. You rarely need eval in Python. There 's a module somewhere in the standard library that can tell you a bit about an objects code ( does n't work in the interp ) , I 've never used it directly. You can find stuff on comp.lang.python that explains it . </p>
<p>As to 'C ' macros which seem to be the real focus of your question . </p>
<p>clears throat DO NOT USE C MACROS IN PYTHON CODE . </p>
<ol>If all you want is a C macro , use the C pre processor to pre process your scripts. Duh . If you want # include , it 's called import . If you want # define , use an immutable object. Think const int foo = 1 ; instead of # define foo 1. Some objects are immutable , like tuples. You can write a function that makes a variable sufficiently immutable. Search the web for an example. I rather like static classes for some cases like that . If you want FOO ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">x</span> , y ) ... code ... ; learn how to use functions and classes . </ol>
<p>Most uses of a 'CPP ' macro in Python , can be accomplished by writing a function. You may wish to get a book on higher order functions , in order to handle more complex cases. I personally like a book called Higher Order Perl ( HOP ) , and although it is not Python based , most of the book covers language independent ideas -- and those ideas should be required learning for every programmer . </p>
<p>For all intents and purposes the only use of the C Pre Processor that you need in Python , that is n't quite provided out of box , is the ability to # define constants , which is often the wrong thing to do , even in C and C + + . </p>
<p>Now implementing lisp macros in python , in a smart way and actually needing them... clears throat and sweeps under rug . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>Well , for the brave , there 's Metapython : </p>
<p>http : //code.google.com/p/metapython/wiki/Tutorial </p>
<pre><code>For instance, the following MetaPython code:

$for i in range(3):
    print $i

will expand to the following Python code:

print 0
print 1
print 2
</code></pre>
<p>But if you have just started with Python , you probably wo n't need it. Just keep practicing the usual dynamic features ( duck typing , callable objects , decorators , generators... ) and you wo n't feel any need for C-style macros . </p>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>You can write this into the second file instead of replicating the code string </p>
<pre><code>"""
from firstFile import replaceProgramFilesPath
"""
</code></pre>
