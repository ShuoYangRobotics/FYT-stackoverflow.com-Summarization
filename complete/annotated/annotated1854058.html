<h3>Question ( ID-1854058 ) : </h3><h2>Python <span style="background-color:yellow;">web</span> application </h2><p>I want to create a very simple python <span style="background-color:yellow;">web</span> app. I do n't need Django or any other <span style="background-color:yellow;">web</span> framwwork like that. Is n't there a simpler way to create a <span style="background-color:yellow;">web</span> app in python ? </p>
<p>Thanks </p>

<p>http : //webpy.org/ </p>
<pre><code>import web

urls = (
    '/(.*)', 'hello'
)
app = web.application(urls, globals())

class hello:        
    def GET(self, name):
        if not name: 
            name = 'world'
        return 'Hello, ' + name + '!'

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>Sure ! For example , </p>
<pre><code>print 'Content-Type: text/plain'
print ''
print 'Hello, world!'
</code></pre>
<p>this is a <span style="background-color:yellow;">web</span> app -- if you save it into a file in an appropriate directory of a machine <span style="background-color:yellow;">running</span> a <span style="background-color:yellow;">web</span> server and set the server 's configuration properly ( depending on the server ) ; the article I pointed to specifically shows how to deploy this <span style="background-color:yellow;">web</span> app to Google App Engine , but just about any <span style="background-color:yellow;">web</span> server can serve CGI apps , and this is a simple example thereof . </p>
<p>Of course , CGI has its limits , and you can use more sophisticated approaches ( still short of a framework ! ) such as WSGI ( also universally supported , if nothing else because it can <span style="background-color:yellow;">run</span> on top of CGI -- but in most cases you can also deploy it in more advanced ways ) and possibly some of the many excellent utility components you can deploy with WSGI to save you work in coding certain parts of your apps . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>WSGI is probably what you are looking for. Though there are several lightweight python <span style="background-color:yellow;">web</span> frameworks around which are less monolithic than django . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>The truth is that you do need a framework of some sort even if it 's extremely minimal. You can use WSGI as a base and at least you 're doing a little better. Python is a very powerful , very unspecific programming language so if you decide to do it without a framework you 're going to have to rewrite huge amounts of code that you may be taking for granted . </p>
<p>If you do decide to go with something other than Django try this list and maybe you 'll find something simple enough that you 'll feel good about it. : ) </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Django is actually quite simple , are you sure you do n't want to use it ? It can be as simple as you need it to be . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>Yep WSGI.. . </p>
<pre><code>def hello_wsgi(environ, start_response):
    start_response('200 OK', [('content-type', 'text/html')])
    return ['Hello world!']
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to abstract this in terms of request/response to get a little further away from http try <span style="background-color:yellow;">webob</span> . </p>
<pre><code>from webob import Request, Response

def hello_wsgi(environ, start_response):
    request = Request(environ)
    #do something with the request
    #return a response
    return Response("Hello World!")(environ, start_response)
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>I use <span style="background-color:yellow;">bottle</span> all the time as a minimal <span style="background-color:yellow;">web</span> framework . It is very simple to use . </p>
<p>as a minimum example - taken from the <span style="background-color:yellow;">web</span> site : </p>
<pre><code>from bottle import route, run

@route('/hello/:name')
def index(name='World'):
    return '<b>Hello %s!</b>' % name

run(host='localhost', port=8080)
</code></pre>
<p>you simply associate url ( <span style="background-color:yellow;">route</span> ) to functions. This one even get an optional argument . It has an optional light templating language , and you can tweak it a lot for our needs. Very powerful . </p>
<p>It is also very easy to instal - as it comes as a single file , standing along your app , and is pure compliant python. It is also very easy to debug , with a nice autoreload on modif while in development mode . </p>
<p>As a final advantages , it <span style="background-color:yellow;">runs</span> smoothly under pypy - thus providing a speed boost over other frameworks . </p>
