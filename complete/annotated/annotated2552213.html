<h3>Question ( ID-2552213 ) : </h3><h2>Which programming language or a library can process Infinite Series ? </h2><p>Which programming language or a library is able to process infinite series ( like geometric or harmonic ) ? It perhaps must have a database of some well-known series and automatically give proper values in case of convergence , and maybe generate an exception in case of divergence . </p>
<p>For example , in Python it could look like : </p>
<pre><code>sum  = 0
sign = -1.0
for i in range(1,Infinity,2):
     sign = -sign
     sum += sign / i
</code></pre>
<p>then , sum must be math.pi/4 without doing any computations in the loop ( because it 's a well-known sum ) . </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-11 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>Most functional languages which evaluate lazily can simulate the processing of infinite series. Of course , on a finite computer it is not possible to process infinite series , as I am sure you are aware. Off the top of my head , I guess Mathematica can do most of what you might want , I suspect that Maple can too , maybe Sage and other computer-algebra systems and I 'd be surprised if you ca n't find a Haskell implementation that suits you . </p>
<p>EDIT to clarify for OP : I do not propose generating infinite loops. Lazy evaluation allows you to write programs ( or functions ) which simulate infinite series , programs which themselves are finite in time and space. With such languages you can determine many of the properties , such as convergence , of the simulated infinite series with considerable accuracy and some degree of certainty. Try Mathematica or , if you do n't have access to it , try Wolfram Alpha to see what one system can do for you . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>One place to look might be the Wikipedia category of Computer Algebra Systems . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>There are two tools available in Haskell for this beyond simply supporting infinite lists . </p>
<p>First there is a module that supports looking up sequences in OEIS. This can be applied to the first few terms of your series and can help you identify a series for which you do n't know the closed form , etc. The other is the 'CReal ' library of computable reals. If you have the ability to generate an ever improving bound on your value ( i.e. by summing over the prefix , you can declare that as a computable real number which admits a partial ordering , etc. In many ways this gives you a value that you can use like the sum above . </p>
<p>However in general computing the equality of two streams requires an oracle for the halting problem , so no language will do what you want in full generality , though some computer algebra systems like Mathematica can try . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>Maxima can calculate some infinite sums , but in this particular case it does n't seem to find the answer : -s </p>
<pre><code>(%i1) sum((-1)^k/(2*k), k, 1, inf), simpsum;
                                 inf
                                 ====       k
                                 \     (- 1)
                                  >    ------
                                 /       k
                                 ====
                                 k = 1
(%o1)                            ------------
                                      2
</code></pre>
<p>but for example , those work : </p>
<pre><code>(%i2) sum(1/(k^2), k, 1, inf), simpsum;
                                        2
                                     %pi
(%o2)                                ----
                                      6

(%i3) sum((1/2^k), k, 1, inf), simpsum;
(%o3)                                  1

<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>For Python check out SymPy - clone of Mathematica and Matlab . </p>
<p>There is also a heavier Python-based math-processing tool called Sage . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>You need something that can do a symbolic computation like Mathematica . You can also consider quering wolframaplha : sum ( ( -1 ) ^ i * 1/i , i , 1 , inf ) </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>You can solve the series problem in Sage ( a free Python-based math software system ) exactly as follows : </p>
<pre><code>sage: k = var('k'); sum((-1)^k/(2*k+1), k, 1, infinity)
1/4*pi - 1
</code></pre>
<p>Behind the scenes , this is really using Maxima ( a component of Sage ) . </p>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>Clojure and Haskell off the top of my head . </p>
<p>Sorry I could n't find a better link to haskell 's sequences , if someone else has it , please let me know and I 'll update . </p>
<br /><b># 8 </b><br /><p>There is a library called mpmath ( python ) , a module of sympy , which provides the series support for sympy ( I believe it also backs sage ) . More specifically , all of the series stuff can be found here : Series documentation </p>
<br /><b># 9 </b><br /><p>The C + + iRRAM library performs real arithmetic exactly . Among other things it can compute limits exactly using the limit function. The homepage for iRRAM is here . Check out the limit function in the documentation. Note that I 'm not talking about arbitrary precision arithmetic. This is exact arithmetic , for a sensible definition of exact. Here 's their code to compute e exactly , pulled from the example on their web site : </p>
<pre><code>//---------------------------------------------------------------------
// Compute an approximation to e=2.71.. up to an error of 2^p
 REAL e_approx (int p)
{
  if ( p >= 2 ) return 0;

  REAL y=1,z=2;
  int i=2;
  while ( !bound(y,p-1) ) {
    y=y/i;
    z=z+y;
    i+=1;
  }
  return z;
};

//---------------------------------------------------------------------
// Compute the exact value of  e=2.71.. 
REAL e()
{
  return limit(e_approx);
};

<br /><b># 10 </b><br /><p>I have worked in couple of Huge Data Series for Research purpose . I used Matlab for that. I did n't know it can/ca n't process Infinite Series . </p>
<p>But I think there is a possibility . U can try : ) </p>
