<h3>Question ( ID-763944 ) : </h3><h2>python , " a in b " keyword , how about multiple a 's ? </h2><p>My adventures in Python continue and my favorite books are silent again. Python offers a built-in way to test if a variable is inside an iterable object , using the 'in ' keyword : </p>
<pre><code>if "a" in "abrakadabra" :
  print "it is definitely here"
</code></pre>
<p>But is it possible to test if more than one item is in the list ( any one ) ? Currently , I 'm using the syntax below , but it is kinda long : </p>
<pre><code>if "// @in " in sTxt or "// @out " in sTxt or "// @ret " in sTxt or <10 more>
  print "found."
</code></pre>
<p>Of course <span style="background-color:yellow;">regexes</span> can help , but using <span style="background-color:yellow;">regexes</span> will take lots of verbose of code and will not be as clear as " a in b " . Are there any other Pythonic ways ? </p>

if any(a in sTxT for a in alternatives):
    print "found"

if all(a in sTxT for a in alternatives):
   print "found all"
</code></pre>
<p>any ( ) and all ( ) takes an iterable and checks if any/all of them evaluate to a true value. Combine that with a generator expressions , and you can check multiple items . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>any ( snippet in text_body for snippet in ( " hi " , " foo " , " bar " , " spam " ) ) </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>If you 're testing lots of <span style="background-color:yellow;">lines</span> for the same words , it may be faster to compile them as a <span style="background-color:yellow;">regular</span> expression. eg : </p>
<pre><code>import  re
words = ["// @in ", "// @out ", "// @ret "] + ["// @test%s " % i for i in range(10)]

my_regex = re.compile("|".join(map(re.escape, words)))

for line in lines_to_search:
    if my_regex.search(line):  print "Found match"
</code></pre>
<p>Some quick timing shows that this is usually faster than the any ( word in theString for word in words ) approach. I 've tested both approaches with varying text ( short/long with/without matches ) . Here are the <span style="background-color:yellow;">results</span> : </p>
<pre><code>         { No keywords  } |  {contain Keywords }
         short    long       short    long
regex  : 0.214    27.214     0.147    0.149
any in : 0.579    81.341     0.295    0.300
</code></pre>
<p>If performance does n't matter though , the any ( ) approach is more <span style="background-color:yellow;">readable</span> . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>If you want any check then you would use this : </p>
<pre><code>inthere = False
checks = ('a', 'b')

for check in checks:
    if check in 'abrakadabra':
        inthere = True
        break
</code></pre>
<p>If you want all check out you could use this : </p>
<pre><code>inthere = True
checks = ('a', 'b')

for check in checks:
    if check not in 'abrakadabra':
        inthere = False
        break
</code></pre>
<p>EDIT : Did n't know the more pythonic any ( ) . It 's probably better to use that on python . </p>
<p>EDIT2 : Added break statements , and corrected the all -case . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>You could also use set methods and operators : </p>
<pre><code>not alternatives.isdisjoint(sTxt)  # for "any"
(alternatives & sTxt) != set()  # Again, the intersection is nonempty
alternatives <= sTxt  # for "all"
</code></pre>
<p>I think these are easier to <span style="background-color:yellow;">read</span> than using the any or all , but have to convert your collections into sets. Since intersection and containment are what you care about , you might consider making them sets in the first place . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>There 's no built in way in the syntax to do it. However you can use the 'any ' function to make it easier as @ MizardX and @ Benjamin Peterson showed . </p>
