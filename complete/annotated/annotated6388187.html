<h3>Question ( ID-6388187 ) : </h3><h2>What is the proper way to format a multi-line dict in Python ? </h2><p>In Python , I want to write a multi-line dict in my code. There are a couple of ways one could format it. Here are a few that I could think of : </p>
<ol>mydict = { " key1 " : 1 , " key2 " : 2 , " key3 " : 3 , } mydict = { " key1 " : 1 , " key2 " : 2 , " key3 " : 3 , } mydict = { " key1 " : 1 , " key2 " : 2 , " key3 " : 3 , } </ol>
<p>I know that any of the above is syntactically correct , but I assume that there is one preferred indentation and line-break style for Python dicts. What is it ? </p>
<p>Note : This is not an issue of syntax. All of the above are ( as far as I know ) valid Python statements and are equivalent to each other . </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-6 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>I use # 3. Same for long lists , tuples , etc. It does n't require adding any extra spaces beyond the indentations. As always , be consistent . </p>
<pre><code>mydict = {
    "key1": 1,
    "key2": 2,
    "key3": 3,
}

mylist = [
    (1, 'hello'),
    (2, 'world'),
]

nested = {
    a: [
        (1, 'a'),
        (2, 'b'),
    ],
    b: [
        (3, 'c'),
        (4, 'd'),
    ],
}
</code></pre>
<p>Similarly , here 's my preferred way of including large strings without introducing any whitespace ( like you 'd get if you used triple-quoted multi-line strings ) : </p>
<pre><code>data = (
    "iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAQCAYAAAAf8/9hAAAABG"
    "l0RVh0U29mdHdhcmUAQWRvYmUgSW1hZ2VSZWFkeXHJZTwAAAEN"
    "xBRpFYmctaKCfwrBSCrRLuL3iEW6+EEUG8XvIVjYWNgJdhFjIX"
    "rz6pKtPB5e5rmq7tmxk+hqO34e1or0yXTGrj9sXGs1Ib73efh1"
    "AAAABJRU5ErkJggg=="
)

<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>Since your keys are strings and since we are talking about readability , I prefer : </p>
<pre><code>mydict = dict(
    key1 = 1,
    key2 = 2,
    key3 = 3,
)
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>From my experience with tutorials , and other things number 2 always seems preferred , but it 's a personal preference choice more than anything else . </p>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>I think 1 and 2 are preferred , but you can check for yourself in the PEP8 guidelines </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>In our projects we are using 1st and 2nd. The only difference is that we also use max length limitation to 81-91 char , so in case of big dictionaries , tuples and so on we starting next line right after exceeding max len limit , for ex : </p>
<pre><code>d = {key:val, ....... <up until 81 char length>,
     keyn:valn, ....... <up until 81 char length>,
     keyx:valx, ....... <up until 81 char length>}
</code></pre>
<p>OR </p>
<pre><code>d = {key:val, ....... <up until 81 char length>,
     keyn:valn, ....... <up until 81 char length>,
     keyx:valx, ....... <up until 81 char length>
    }
</code></pre>
<p>But sometimes - really very rarelly : </p>
<pre><code>d = {
     key:val, ....... <up until 81 char length>,
     keyn:valn, ....... <up until 81 char length>,
     keyx:valx, ....... <up until 81 char length>
    }
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>Generally , you would not include the comma after the final entry , but Python will correct that for you . </p>
