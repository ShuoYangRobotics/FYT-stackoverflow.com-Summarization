<h3>Question ( ID-2213531 ) : </h3><h2>What 's the pythonic way of declaring variables ? </h2><p>Usually declaring variables on assignment is considered a best practice in VBScript or JavaScript , for example , although it is allowed . </p>
<p>Why does Python force you to create the variable only when you use it ? Since Python is case sensitive ca n't it cause bugs because you misspelled a variable 's name ? </p>
<p>How would you avoid such a situation ? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-8 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>If you want a class with " locked-down " instance attributes , it 's not hard to make one , e.g. : </p>
<pre><code>class LockedDown(object):
  __locked = False
  def __setattr__(self, name, value):
    if self.__locked:
      if name[:2] != '__' and name not in self.__dict__:
        raise ValueError("Can't set attribute %r" % name)
    object.__setattr__(self, name, value)
  def _dolock(self):
    self.__locked = True

class Example(LockedDown):
  def __init__(self):
    self.mistakes = 0
    self._dolock()
  def onemore(self):
    self.mistakes += 1
    print self.mistakes
  def reset(self):
    self.mitsakes = 0

x = Example()
for i in range(3): x.onemore()
x.reset()
</code></pre>
<p>As you 'll see , the calls to x.onemore work just fine , but <span style="background-color:yellow;">reset</span> raises an exception because of the mis-spelling of the attribute as mitsakes . The rules of engagement here are that <span style="background-color:yellow;">__init__</span> must set all attributes to initial values , then call <span style="background-color:yellow;">self._dolock</span> ( ) to forbid any further addition of attributes. I 'm exempting " super-private " attributes ( ones starting with __ ) , which stylistically should be used very rarely , for totally specific roles , and with extremely limited scope ( making it trivial to spot typos in the super-careful inspection that 's needed anyway to confirm the need for super-privacy ) , but that 's a stylistic choice , easy to reverse ; similarly for the choice to make the locked-down state " irreversible " ( by " normal " means -- i.e. requiring very explicit workaround to bypass ) . </p>
<p>This does n't apply to other kinds of names , such as function-local ones ; again , no big deal because each function should be very small , and is a totally <span style="background-color:yellow;">self-contained</span> scope , trivially easy to inspect ( if you write 100-lines functions , you have other , serious problems ; - ) . </p>
<p>Is this worth the bother ? No , because semi-decent unit tests should obviously catch all such typos with the greatest of ease , as a natural side effect of thoroughly exercising the class 's functionality. In other words , it 's not as if you need to have more unit tests just to catch the typos : the unit tests you need anyway to catch trivial semantic errors ( off-by-one , + 1 where -1 is meant , etc. , etc. ) will already catch all typos , too . </p>
<p>Robert Martin and Bruce Eckel both articulated this point 7 years ago in separate and independent articles -- Eckel 's blog is temporarily down right now , but Martin 's right here , and when Eckel 's site revives the article should be here . The thesis is controversial ( Jeff Attwood and his commenters debate it here , for example ) , but it 's interesting to note that Martin and Eckel are both well-known experts of static languages such as C + + and Java ( albeit with love affairs , respectively , with Ruby and Python ) , and they 're far from the only ones to have discovered the importance of unit-tests... and how a good unit-tests suite , as a side effect , makes a static language 's rigidity redundant . </p>
<p>By the way , one way to check your test suites is " error injection " : systematically go over your codebase introducing one mis-spelling -- run the tests to make sure they do fail , if they do n't add one that does fail , correct the spelling mistake , repeat. Can be fairly well automated ( not the " add a test " part , but the finding of potential errors that are n't covered by the suite ) , as can some other forms of error injections ( change every integer constant , one by one , to one more , and to one less ; change each &lt ; to &lt ; = etc ; swap each if and while condition to its reverse ; ... ) , while other forms of error-injection yet require a lot more human savvy. Unfortunately I do n't know of publicly available suites of error injection frameworks ( for any language ) -- might make a cool open source project ; - ) . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>In python it helps to think of declaring variables as binding values to names . </p>
<p>Try not to misspell them , or you will have new ones ( assuming you are talking about assignment statements - referencing them will cause an exception ) . </p>
<p>If you are talking about instance variables , you wo n't be able to use them afterwards . </p>
<p>For example , if you had a class myclass and in its <span style="background-color:yellow;">__init__</span> method wrote <span style="background-color:yellow;">self.myvar</span> = 0 , then trying to reference <span style="background-color:yellow;">self.myvare</span> will cause an error , rather than give you a default value . </p>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>It 's a silly artifact of Python 's inspiration by " teaching languages " , and it serves to make the language more accessible by removing the stumbling block of " declaration " entirely. For whatever reason ( probably represented as " simplicity " ) , Python never gained an optional stricture like VB 's " Option Explicit " to introduce mandatory declarations. Yes , it can be a source of bugs , but as the other answers here demonstrate , good coders can develop habits that allow them to compensate for pretty much any shortcoming in the language -- and as shortcomings go , this is a pretty minor one . </p>
<br /><b># <span style="background-color:yellow;">3</span> </b><br /><p>Python never forces you to create a variable only when you use it. You can always bind None to a name and then use the name elsewhere later . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>To avoid a situation with misspelling variable names , I use a text-editor with an autocompletion function and binded </p>
<pre><code> python -c "import py_compile; py_compile.compile('{filename}')"
</code></pre>
<p>to a function to be called when I save a file . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>If you do any serious development you 'll use a ( integrated ) development environment. Pylint will be part of it and tell you all your misspellings. No need to make such a feature part of the langauge . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>Test . </p>

<pre><code>#! /usr/bin/python

<p>I 've done enough VBScript development to know that typos are a problem in variable name , and enough VBScript development to know that Option Explicit is a crutch at best. ( &lt ; - 12 years of ASP VBScript experience taught me that the hard way. ) </p>
<br /><b># 7 </b><br /><p>Variable declaration does not prevent bugs. Any more than lack of variable declaration causes bugs . </p>
<p>Variable declarations prevent one specific type of bug , but it creates other types bugs . </p>
<p>Prevent . Writing code where there 's an attempt to set ( or change ) a variable with the wrong type of data . </p>
<p>Causes . Stupid workarounds to coerce a number of unrelated types together so that assignments will " just work " . <span style="background-color:yellow;">Example</span> : The C language union . Also , variable declarations force us to use casts. Which also forces us to suppress warnings on casts at compile time because we " know " it will " just work " . And it does n't . </p>
<p>Lack of variable declarations does not cause bugs. The most common " threat scenario " is some kind of " mis-assignment " to a variable . </p>
<ol>Was the variable being " reused " ? This is dumb but legal and works . Was some part of the program incorrectly assigning the wrong type ? That leads to a subtle question of " what does wrong mean ? " In a duck-typed language , wrong means " Does n't offer the right methods or attributes. " Which is still nebulous. Specifically , it means " the type will be asked to provide a method or attribute it does n't have. " Which will raise an exception and the program will stop . </ol>
<p>Raising an uncaught exception in production use is annoying and shows a lack of quality. It 's stupid , but it 's also a detected , known failure mode with a traceback to the exact root cause . </p>
<p>" ca n't it cause bugs because you misspelled a variable 's name " </p>
<p>Yes. It can . </p>
<p>But consider this Java code . </p>
<pre><code>public static void maine( String[] argv ) {
    int main;
    int mian;
}
</code></pre>
<p>A misspelling here is equally fatal. Statically typed Java has done nothing to prevent a misspelled variable name from causing a bug . </p>
