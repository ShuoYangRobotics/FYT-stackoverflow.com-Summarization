<h3>Question ( ID-419379 ) : </h3><h2>How to maintain lists and dictionaries between function calls in Python ? </h2><p>Its urgent.. . </p>
<p>I have a function. Inside that I 'm maintainfing a dictionary of values . I want that dictionary to be maintained between different function calls </p>
<p>Suppose the dic is : </p>
<pre><code>a = {'a':1,'b':2,'c':3}
</code></pre>
<p>At first call,say,I changed a [ a ] to 100 Dict becomes a = { 'a ' : 100,'b ' : 2,'c ' : 3 } </p>
<p>At another call,i changed a [ b ] to 200 I want that dic to be a = { 'a ' : 100,'b ' : 200,'c ' : 3 } </p>
<p>But in my code a [ a ] does n't remain 100.It changes to initial value 1 . </p>
<p>I need an answer ASAP....I m already late...Please help me friends.. . </p>
<br /><h3>Answers ( Total-7 ) : </h3><b># 0 </b><br /><p>You might be talking about a callable object . </p>
<pre><code>class MyFunction( object ):
    def __init__( self ):
        self.rememberThis= dict()
    def __call__( self, arg1, arg2 ):
        # do something
        rememberThis['a'] = arg1
        return someValue

myFunction= MyFunction()
</code></pre>
<p>From then on , use <span style="background-color:yellow;">myFunction</span> as a simple function. You can access the rememberThis dictionary using <span style="background-color:yellow;">myFunction.rememberThis</span> . </p>
<br /><b># 1 </b><br /><p>You could use a static variable : </p>
<pre><code>def foo(k, v):
  foo.a[k] = v
foo.a = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}

foo('a', 100)
foo('b', 200)

print foo.a
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 2 </b><br /><p>If 'a ' is being created inside the function. It is going out of scope. Simply create it outside the function ( and before the function is called ) . By doing this the list/hash will not be deleted after the program leaves the function . </p>
<pre><code>a = {'a':1,'b':2,'c':3}

# call you funciton here
</code></pre>
<br /><b># 3 </b><br /><p>You can 'cheat ' using Python 's behavior for default arguments. Default arguments are only evaluated once ; they get reused for every call of the function . </p>
<pre><code>>>> def testFunction(persistent_dict={'a': 0}):
...     persistent_dict['a'] += 1
...     print persistent_dict['a']
...
>>> testFunction()
1
>>> testFunction()
2
</code></pre>
<p>This is n't the most elegant solution ; if someone calls the function and passes in a parameter it will override the default , which probably is n't what you want . </p>
<p>If you just want a quick and dirty way to get the results , that will work. If you 're doing something more complicated it might be better to factor it out into a class like S. Lott mentioned . </p>
<p>EDIT : Renamed the dictionary so it would n't hide the builtin dict as per the comment below . </p>
<br /><b># 4 </b><br /><p>Rather than forcing globals on the code base ( that can be the decision of the caller ) I prefer the idea of keeping the state related to an instance of the function. A class is good for this but does n't communicate well what you are trying to accomplish and can be a bit verbose. Taking advantage of closures is , in my opinion , a lot cleaner . </p>
<pre><code>def function_the_world_sees():
    a = {'a':1,'b':2,'c':3}

    def actual_function(arg0, arg1):
        a[arg0] = arg1
        return a

    return actual_function
stateful_function = function_the_world_sees()

stateful_function("b", 100)    
stateful_function("b", 200)
</code></pre>
<p>The main caution to keep in mind is that when you make assignments in " <span style="background-color:yellow;">actual_function</span> " , they occur within " <span style="background-color:yellow;">actual_function</span> " . This means you ca n't reassign a to a different variable. The work arounds I use are to put all of my variables I plan to reassign into either into a single element list per variable or a dictionary . </p>
<br /><b># 5 </b><br /><p>This question does n't have an elegant answer , in my opinion. The options are callable objects , default values , and attribute hacks. Callable objects are the right answer , but they bring in a lot of structure for what would be a single " static " declaration in another language. Default values are a minor change to the code , but it 's kludgy and can be confusing to a new python programmer looking at your code. I do n't like them because their existence is n't hidden from anyone who might be looking at your API . </p>
<p>I generally go with an attribute hack. My preferred method is : </p>
<pre><code>def myfunct():
    if not hasattr(myfunct, 'state'): myfunct.state = list()
    # access myfunct.state in the body however you want
</code></pre>
<p>This keeps the declaration of the state in the first line of the function where it belongs , as well as keeping <span style="background-color:yellow;">myfunct</span> as a function. The downside is you do the attribute check every time you call the function. This is almost certainly not going to be a bottleneck in most code . </p>
<br /><b># 6 </b><br /><p>Personally , I like the idea of the global statement. It does n't introduce a global variable but states that a local identifier actually refers to one in the global namespace . </p>
<pre><code>d = dict()
l = list()
def foo(bar, baz):
    global d
    global l
    l.append(bar, baz)
    d[bar] = baz
</code></pre>
<p>In python 3.0 there is also a " nonlocal " statement . </p>
