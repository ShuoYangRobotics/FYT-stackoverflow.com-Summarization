Question (ID-7567318): Python: How to make a list of n numbers and randomly select any number? I have taken a count of something and it came out to N 

 Now I would like to have a list, containing 0 to N numbers in it.
Example: 
N = 5
then, count_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 

 How would I be able to do that? 

 Also, once I have created the list, 
I would like to randomly select a number from that list and use that number.
After that I would like to select another number from the remaining numbers of the list (N-1) and then use that also. 
This goes on it the list is empty. 
could someone please help me with this?
Thanks 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 You can try this code 

 import random
N = 5
count_list = range(1,N+1)
random.shuffle(count_list)

while count_list:
 value = count_list.pop()
 # do whatever you want with 'value'
 
 #1 You can create the enumeration of the elements by something like that: 

 mylist = list(xrange(10))
 

 then you can use the random.choice function to select your items: 

 import random
...
random.choice(mylist)
 

 EDIT: 

 As Asim Ihsan correctly stated, my answer does not yet address the full problem of the OP. To remove the values from the list, simply list.remove() can be called: 

 import random
...
value = random.choice(mylist)
mylist.remove(value)
 
 #2 As for the first part: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; N = 5
&gt;&gt;&gt; count_list = [i+1 for i in xrange(N)]
&gt;&gt;&gt; count_list
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
 

 As for the second, read this:
 http://docs.python.org/library/random.html 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; from random import choice
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = choice(count_list)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; count_list.remove(a)
&gt;&gt;&gt; count_list
[2, 3, 4, 5]
 

 That's the general idea. 

 By the way, you may also be interested in reading this:

 There are a few implementations of fast random selection. 
 #3 You can use: 

 import random
random.choice(range(n))
 

 or: 

 random.choice(range(1,n+1))
 

 if you want it from 1 to n and not from 0 . 
 #4 Create the list (edited): 

 count_list = range(1, N+1)
 

 Select random element: 

 import random
random.choice(count_list)
 
 #5 You don't need to count stuff if you want to pick a random element. Just use random.choice() and pass your iterable: 

 import random
items = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
print random.choice(items)
 

 If you really have to count them, use random.randint(1, count+1) . 
 #6 
 After that I would like to select another number from the remaining numbers of the list (N-1) and then use that also. 
 

 Then you arguably do not really want to create a list of numbers from 1 to N just for the purpose of picking one (why not just ask for a random number in that range directly, instead of explicitly creating it to choose from?), but instead to shuffle such a list. Fortunately, the random module has you covered for this, too: just use random.shuffle . 

 Of course, if you have a huge list of numbers and you only want to draw a few, then it certainly makes sense to draw each using random.choice and remove it. 

 But... why do you want to select numbers from a range, that corresponds to the count of some items? Are you going to use the number to select one of the items? Don't do that; that's going out of your way to make things too complicated. If you want to select one of the items, then do so directly - again with random.choice .
