Question (ID-4419313): Are there any Web Sever modules in python? I am looking for a web server module for python to work as a part of an application. 

 I tried SimpleHTTPServer but it doesn't process python files. It serves the source code as text instead which is not what I am trying to accomplish. I need the server to be a module of python and process python files and serve the return of these files. 

 Is that possible ? Are there any (Simple,Light weight)good [or bad] modules to do that ? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 There are many frameworks that will do what you are asking, but it is up to you to decide which one will be best. Here are some you should look into: 

 
 http://www.tornadoweb.org/ 
 http://www.djangoproject.com/ 
 http://webpy.org/

 Django is full featured, with models, views, and templates. Webpy is super light weight, but closer to the bare metal. Tornado is fast, light weight, and has a nice template language similar to Django. 
 #1 You could take a look at Django , which has a development server included. It might be a bit heavy for your needs though. 
 #2 cherrypy 
 #3 twisted has a web module. 
 #4 Paste 
 #5 Nicholas PiÃ«l did an excellent technical summary of the many different options, including benchmarking the lot of them. The article is here, and is definitely worth a read:
