Question (ID-7790811): How do I put variables inside javascript strings? (Node.js) s = 'hello %s, how are you doing' % (my_name)
 

 That's how you do it in python. How can you do that in javascript/node.js? 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 Do that 

 s = 'hello ' + my_name + ', how are you doing'
 
 #1 If you want to have something similar, you could create a function: 

 function parse(str) {
 var args = [].slice.call(arguments, 1),
  i = 0;

 return str.replace(/%s/g, function() {
  return args[i++];
 });
}
 

 Usage: 

 s = parse('hello %s, how are you doing', my_name);
 

 This is only a simple example and does not take into account different kinds of data types (like %i , etc) or escaping of %s . But I hope if gives you some idea. I'm pretty sure there are also libraries out there which provide a function like this. 
 #2 Try sprintf in JS 
 or you could use this gist 
 #3 var user = "your name";
var s = 'hello ' + user + ', how are you doing';
 
 #4 util.format does this. 

 It will be part of v0.5.3 and can be used like this: 

 var uri = util.format('http%s://%s%s', 
  (useSSL?'s':''), apiBase, path||'/');
 
 #5 Maybe my little String extension works for you? 

 String.prototype.template = String.prototype.template ||
 function (){
  var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)
   ,str = this
  ;
  function replacer(a){
  var aa = parseInt(a.substr(1),10)-1;
  return args[aa];
  }
  return str.replace(/(\$\d+)/gm,replacer)
};
//example
var wrld = 'world'
 ,hay = 'how are you today?'
 ,str = 'hello $1, $2'
;
alert(str.template(wrld,hay)); //=&gt; hello world, how are you today?
 
 #6 If you are using node.js, console.log() takes format string as a first parameter: 

 console.log('count: %d', count);
