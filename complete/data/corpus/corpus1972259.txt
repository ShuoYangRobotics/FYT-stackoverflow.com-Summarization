Question (ID-1972259): mysql-python install problem using virtualenv, windows, pip I'm trying to install mysql-python in a virtualenv using pip on windows. At first, I was getting the same error reported here , but the answer there worked for me too. Now I'm getting this following error: 

 _mysql.c(34) : Fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'config-win.h': No such file or directory 

 edit :
If I symlink (Win7) to my regular (not the virtualenv's) python's site-packages/MySQLdb dir I get Error loading MySQLdb module: No module named _mysql . 

 I'm rather at a loss here. Any pointers? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Update for mysql 5.5 and config-win.h not visible issue 

 In 5.5 config-win. has actually moved to Connector separate folder in windows. i.e. smth like: 

 C:\Program Files\MySQL\Connector C 6.0.2\include 

 To overcome the problem one need not only to download "dev bits" (which actually connects the connector ) but also to modify mysqldb install scripts to add the include folder. I've done a quick dirty fix as that. 

 site.cfg: 

 # Windows connector libs for MySQL.
connector = C:\Program Files\MySQL\Connector C 6.0.2
 

 in setup_windows.py locate the line 

 include_dirs = [ os.path.join(mysql_root, r'include') ]:
 

 and add: 

 include_dirs = [ os.path.join(options['connector'], r'include') ]
 

 after it. 

 Ugly but works until mysqldb authors will change the behaviour. 

 

 Almost forgot to mention. In the same manner one needs to add similar additional entry for libs: 

 library_dirs = [ os.path.join(options['connector'], r'lib\opt') ]
 

 i.e. your setup_windows.py looks pretty much like: 

 ...
library_dirs = [ os.path.join(mysql_root, r'lib\opt') ]
library_dirs = [ os.path.join(options['connector'], r'lib\opt') ]
libraries = [ 'kernel32', 'advapi32', 'wsock32', client ]
include_dirs = [ os.path.join(mysql_root, r'include') ]
include_dirs = [ os.path.join(options['connector'], r'include') ]
extra_compile_args = [ '/Zl' ]
...
 
 #1 Installing dev bits for mysql got rid of the config-win.h error I was having, and threw another. Failed to load and parse the manifest. The system cannot find the file specified. I found the answer to my problem in this post: http://www.fuyun.org/2009/12/install-mysql-for-python-on-windows/ . 

 I copied the file 'C:\Python26\Lib\distutils\msvc9compiler.py` into my virtualenv, made the edit suggested in the above link, and things are working fine. 
 #2 Most probably the answer is to install MySQL Developer Build and selecting "C headers\libs" option during configuration. (as reported in this entry: Building MySQLdb for Python on Windows on rationalpie.wordpress.com) 

 Maybe even better solution is to install a precompiled build: http://www.technicalbard.com/files/MySQL-python-1.2.2.win32-py2.6.exe 
 #3 Well, if you are still having the problem, you can download the installer from http://code.google.com/p/soemin/downloads/detail?name=MySQL-python-1.2.3.win32-py2.7.exe 
 #4 Try ActivePython , 

 pypm -E C:\myvirtualenv install mysql-python
 
 #5 No need to configure and build anything manually.
Just download this and install.
Everything works well in Python2.7 for MySql 5.5
