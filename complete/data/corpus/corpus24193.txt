Question (ID-24193): Python code generator for Visual Studio? I had an idea, if I add a python .py file to my C# project, and tag the file with a custom generator that would execute the python file, and treat the output as the result of the code generation, ie. put it into a C# file, that would allow me to do quite a lot of code generation as part of the build process. 

 Does anyone know if such a custom generator for Visual Studio 2008 exists? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 I think Cog does what you want. 
 #1 I recall that in previous versions of VS, there was a way to add custom build steps to the build process. I used that a lot to do exactly the kind of automated code generation you describe. 

 I imagine the custom build step feature is still there in 2008. 
 #2 I don't understand what you are trying to do here. Are you trying to execute a Python script that generates a C# file and then compile that with the project? Or are you trying to compile a Python script to C#? 
 #3 OK, I see. Well, as far as I know there isn't any code generator for Python. There is a good introduction on how to roll your own here . 

 Actually, that's quite an under-used part of the environment, I suppose it's so because it needs you to use the IDE to compile the project, as it'd seem only the IDE knows about these "generators", but MSBuild ignores them. 
 #4 I dug through my old bookmarks (I love Del.icio.us!) and found this article: Code Generation with Python, Cog, and Nant . Keep in mind that anything you can do in NAnt can probably be done in MSBuild as well. This should be enough to get you started. 
 #5 Yes, they are of course, but I'd still like to have a custom generator, as this would automatically be invoked if I changed the Python file, and thus regenerating the code in question.
