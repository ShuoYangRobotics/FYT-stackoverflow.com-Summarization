Question (ID-6387776): Accessing content of each list of a list of list in Python It seems a bit convoluted printed like this, but what I want should be quite simple.
I have a list of list in Python. 

 Lets say list = [[A, B, C], [D, B], [E], [X, Y, Z]] 

 I want to iterate over the elements of each inner list following a certain order
I tried 

 for i in range(0, 10):
 for item in list[i]:
  &lt;do action on item&gt;
 

 But I get a syntax error from Python pointing to list[i] , doesn't seem to like it very much. 

 EDIT : I want to iterate through one inner list at a time
For example : 

 for i in range(0, 1):
 print i
 for item in list[i] #or something that works..
  print item
 

 would print 

 0
A
B
C
1
D
B
 

 Any idea why this is blocking ? 

 And the traceback simply says that there is a syntax error there ... 

 RE-EDIT : I solved my problem by using an other data structure. It was a bit over complicated. Sorry for wasting your time, but thanks for the tips anyway ! 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 This is because your outer list has only 4 elements, and thus does not have an index 4 (or 5 or 6, etc). This is why you are getting an index error. 

 It's analogous to this: 

 
 
  
  L = [1, 2, 3]
  L[6] # L does not have a 6th index
   Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "", line 1, in 
   IndexError: list index out of range 
  
 
 

 What you should do instead, is this: 

 for sub_list in L:
 for item in sub_list:
  &lt;do action on item&gt;
 

 In response to your edit: 

 As a note, don't use types as variable names. So don't call your list list. Perhaps this is where some of the dislike is coming from. 

 If the error is something to the effect of "type is not subscriptable", then this is exactly why you are getting the error. You can fix it by changing the name of list to something else - I would recommend L 
 #1 Are you looking for 

 for my_list in list_of_lists:
 for item in my_list:
  # whatever
 
 #2 What you want is to chain the sublists and iterate. Itertools module has a function to do this, and is very simple and efficient: 

 for item in itertools.chain.from_iterable(list_of_lists):
 &lt;do action on item&gt;
 
 #3 maybe you get an error because you used range(0,10) but your list does not have 10 entries? 

 l = [['a', 'b', 'c'], ['d', 'b'], ['e'], ['x', 'y', 'z']]
for i in range (0,len(l)):
 for item in l[i]:
  print item

a
b
c
d
b
e
x
y
z
 
 #4 Your error may be related to i being greater than the number of inner lists. To avoid this you could instead use 

 for inner in list:
 for item in inner:
  &lt;do action on item&gt;
 
 #5 You may use something like this too: 

 l = [['a', 'b', 'c'], ['d', 'b'], ['e'], ['x', 'y', 'z']]
[val for row in l for val in row]
 

 Or in case you need to perform any action: 

 for val in (val for row in l for val in row):
 # do smth
 

 OR: 

 action = lambda x: str(x)+'_1'
[map(lambda val: action(val), row) for row in l]
 

 OR: 

 action = lambda x: str(x)+'_1'
map(lambda row: map(lambda val: action(val), row), l)
