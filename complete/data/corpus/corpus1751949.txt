Question (ID-1751949): Python equivalent of ruby's StringScanner? Is there a python class equivalent to ruby's StringScanner class ? I Could hack something together, but i don't want to reinvent the wheel if this already exists. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Interestingly there's an undocumented Scanner class in the re module: 

 import re

def s_ident(scanner, token): return token
def s_operator(scanner, token): return "op%s" % token
def s_float(scanner, token): return float(token)
def s_int(scanner, token): return int(token)

scanner = re.Scanner([
 (r"[a-zA-Z_]\w*", s_ident),
 (r"\d+\.\d*", s_float),
 (r"\d+", s_int),
 (r"=|\+|-|\*|/", s_operator),
 (r"\s+", None),
 ])

print scanner.scan("sum = 3*foo + 312.50 + bar")
 

 Following the discussion it looks like it was left in as experimental code/a starting point for others. 
 #1 There is nothing exactly like Ruby's StringScanner in Python. It is of course easy to put something together: 

 import re

class Scanner(object):
 def __init__(self, s):
  self.s = s
  self.offset = 0
 def eos(self):
  return self.offset == len(self.s)
 def scan(self, pattern, flags=0):
  if isinstance(pattern, basestring):
   pattern = re.compile(pattern, flags)
  match = pattern.match(self.s, self.offset)
  if match is not None:
   self.offset = match.end()
   return match.group(0)
  return None
 

 along with an example of using it interactively 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; s = Scanner("Hello there!")
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.scan(r"\w+") 
'Hello'
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.scan(r"\s+") 
' '
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.scan(r"\w+")
'there'
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.eos()
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.scan(r".*")
'!'
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.eos()
True
&gt;&gt;&gt;
 

 However, for the work I do I tend to just write those regular expressions in one go and use groups to extract the needed fields. Or for something more complicated I would write a one-off tokenizer or look to PyParsing or PLY to tokenize for me. I don't see myself using something like StringScanner. 
 #2 Looks like a variant on re.split( pattern, string ) .

 #3 Are you looking for regular expressions in Python? Check this link from official docs:

 #4 Today there is a project by Mark Watkinson that implements StringScanner in Python:

 #5 Maybe look into the built in module tokenize . It looks like you can pass a string into it using the StringIO module .
