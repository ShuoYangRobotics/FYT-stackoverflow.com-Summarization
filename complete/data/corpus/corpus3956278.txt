Question (ID-3956278): What is the PHP equivalent to Python's Try: ... Except: I am a strong Python programmer, but not quite there when it comes to PHP. I need to try something, and if that doesn't work out, do something else. 

 

 This is what it would look like in Python: 

 try:
  print "stuf"
except:
  print "something else"
 

 What would this be in PHP? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 http://php.net/manual/en/language.exceptions.php 

 try {
 print 'stuff';
} catch (Exception $e) {
 var_dump($e);
}
 

 Note: this only works for exceptions, not errors. 

 See http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.set-error-handler.php for that. 
 #1 try {

 // do stuff ...

} catch (Exception $e) {

 print($e-&gt;getMessage());

}
 

 See http://php.net/manual/en/language.exceptions.php 
 #2 PHP does not natively support error catching like Python does, unless you override the default behavior and set your own error handler . PHP's try - catch was only recently added to the language in version 5, and it can only catch exceptions you explicitly throw . 

 So basically, PHP distinguishes between errors and exceptions. Errors haven't been modularized and made available to the user like they have been in Python. I believe that's related to the fact that PHP began as a collection of dynamic web scripts , grew and gained more features over time, and only more recently offered improved OOP support (i.e., version 5); whereas Python fundamentally supports OOP and other meta-functionality. And exception handling from the beginning . 

 Here's an example usage (again, a throw is necessary, or else nothing will be caught): 

 function oops($a)
{
 if (!$a) {
  throw new Exception('empty variable');
 }
 return "oops, $a";
}

try {
 print oops($b);
} catch (Exception $e) {
 print "Error occurred: " . $e-&gt;getMessage();
}
 
 #3 You can handle PHP errors like they were exceptions by using set_error_handler 

 In this error handler function you can throw various exception, according to error level for instance. 

 By doing this you can treat any error (including programming errors) in a common way. 
 #4 PHP 5 has the exception model : 

 try {
 print 'stuff';
} catch (Exception $e) {
 echo 'Caught exception: ', $e-&gt;getMessage(), "\n";
}
 
 #5 Assuming you're trying to catch exceptions, take a look at http://php.net/manual/en/language.exceptions.php 

 You could try something like 

 try {
echo "Stuff";
} catch (Exception $e) {
echo "Something Else";
}
