Question (ID-1780904): Adding even values to new list Python If I have a list and I want to create a list with only even values of the original list, how would I do that? 

 I originally have: 

 list1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
list2 = []
for v in list1:
 if v % 2 == 0:
  list2 += v
print list2
 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 List comprehension is the way to go: 

 list1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
list2 = [i for i in list1 if i%2 == 0]
print list2 # =&gt; [2, 4]
 
 #1 If you want to extend an existing list2 (not necessarily initially empty): 

 list2.extend(v for v in list1 if v % 2 == 0)
 

 If there's no "initial value" for list2 , and you just want to build it from scratch: 

 list2 = [v for v in list1 if v % 2 == 0]
 

 You'll notice that the inner part is identical -- you can use that part in different ways (inside brackets to create a new list, as argument to .extend to extend an existing list, and so forth). 
 #2 You can use list comprehensions : 

 list2 = [x for x in list1 if x % 2 == 0]
 
 #3 list2 = [x for x in list1 if x%2 == 0]
 
 #4 list2 = [i for i in list1 if not i%2]
 
 #5 I find this to be the most readable solution: 

 list2 = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0: list1)
 

 or if you have to use this function multiple times: 

 is_even = lambda x: x % 2 == 0

list2 = filter(is_even, list1)
