Question (ID-1100840): IRC Python Bot: Best Way I want to build a bot that basically does the following: 

 
 Listens to the room and interacts with users and encourages them to PM the bot. 
 Once a user has PMed the bot engage with the client using various AI techniques. 
 

 Should I just use the IRC library or Sockets in python or do I need more of a bot framework. 

 What would you do? 

 Thanks! 

 Here is the code I'm currently using, however, I haven't gotten it to work. 

 #!/usr/bin/python 
import socket
network = 'holmes.freenet.net'
port = 6667
irc = socket.socket ( socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM )
irc.connect ( ( network, port ) )
irc.send ( 'NICK PyIRC\r\n' )
irc.send ( 'USER PyIRC PyIRC PyIRC :Python IRC\r\n' )
irc.send ( 'JOIN #pyirc\r\n' )
irc.send ( 'PRIVMSG #pyirc :Can you hear me?\r\n' )
irc.send ( 'PART #pyirc\r\n' )
irc.send ( 'QUIT\r\n' )
irc.close()
 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 Use Twisted or Asynchat if you want to have a sane design. It is possible to just do it with sockets but why bother doing it from scratch? 
 #1 If you want to have AI techniques involved, then I suggest you look at the AIML package for Python. It is the same technology that ALICE bots are done in. 
 #2 I made a (very crappy, and for a long time being refactored) IRC bot using irclib . The documentation is next-to-nothing, but it gets rid of making you have to do all that socket connecting and such, which is stuff I really don't want to deal with. To each his own, though. 
 #3 Use an existing IRC library instead of implementing the protocol yourself. 
 #4 If what you want is to create the AI portion, why bother writing all the code needed for the IRC connection by yourself? 

 I suggest using SupyBot , and simply write your AI-code as a plugin for it. There is reasonably understandable documentation and lots of example-code to find. Also, it comes with a decent amount of plugins for all sorts of uses that might complement your AI. 
 #5 As I'm replying ~2 years later, I'm writing this just for Googlers :-P 

 Just try my 'Yet Another Useless IRC Bot' here https://github.com/julienpalard/yauib permitting you to code each feature of your bot using whatever language you want. 
 #6 You'll have to implement a few lines to send a reply to the server's PINGs
