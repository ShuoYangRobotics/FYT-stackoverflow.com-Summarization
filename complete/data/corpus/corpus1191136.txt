Question (ID-1191136): Hosting Mercurial with IIS 6 I'm trying to set up Mercurial repositories to be hosted by IIS under Windows Server 2003. Following this post I installed Python 2.5.4.4 and Mercurial 1.3, set up virtual dir, extracted library.zip and created hgwebdir.config. 

 However, when I trying to open the http://hostname/hg/hgwebdir.cgi I got an error “The specified CGI application misbehaved by not returning a complete set of HTTP headers.” I did all by best: 

 
 Checked IIS mappings to both .py and .cgi extensions. I even tried to use FastCGI with no success. 
 Created “Hello World” in the same dir and checked that it works fine. 
 Checked read/exec permissions to Python, IIS and repos directories for IUSR, IWAM and NETWORK SERVICE. 
 Tried to apply two different patches from Mercurial mailing list . Since they both are old I haven't success with it. 
 INstalled Sysinternals' procmon and checked for filesystem errors during request. I found nothing except lots of Buffer Overflow results in Python process while it loads it's libraries. 
 Tried to add 'Content-type: text/html' to the script. 
 

 One more thing is when I'm requesting inexistent script file (e.g /hg/inexist.cgi) I have the same error. Nothing helped! 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Some more things that I needed to fix: 

 
 Where the various HOWTOs say to use c:\whatever\Python26\python.exe -u "%s" "%s" instead use c:\whatever\Python26\python.exe -u -O -B "%s" "%s" -O causes it to also look for .pyo files (not just .py or .pyc, which at least in my version weren't present). -B causes it to not attempt to compile .py files that it finds into .pyo files (which fails due to lacking write permissions) 
 I'd installed Python 2.7. Mercurial 1.6.2's .pyo files were compiled with Python 2.6. This resulted in a magic number error. Uninstalling 2.7 and installing 2.6.5 fixed this. (If you're reading this at some point in the future, this point may no longer be relevant - check the name of the DLL in Mercurial's directory, or TortoiseHg's directory, depending on where you took library.zip from) 
 hgwebdir.cgi is now just hgweb.cgi - webdir was integrated into it 
 
 #1 Finally I got that "no headers" error returned on any python script error, so I checked script with console interpreter and fixed errors in my config file. And of course I should ask this question at ServerFault instead of StackOverflow - the lack of sleep did the job :) 
 #2 In my situation, this error caused by line application = hgwebdir('c:\somewhere\hgweb.config') in hgweb.cgi, it should be application = hgweb('c:\somewhere\hgweb.config') . 

 Besides, uncomment line import cgitb; cgitb.enable() in hgweb.cgi will give you more info about the error( and other errors). 

 P.S. I use Python 2.6.6 and Mercurial 1.7.3 on Windows Server 2003 with IIS 6.0. 
 #3 In my case, the critical step that fixed it was using: c:\whatever\Python26\python.exe -u -O -B "%s" "%s 

 Before that it was not working with the error: 

 A problem occurred in a Python script. Here is the sequence of function calls leading up to the error, in the order they occurred.

 c:\hg\hgweb.cgi in ()
 13 import cgitb; cgitb.enable()
 14 
 15 from mercurial import demandimport; demandimport.enable()
 16 from mercurial.hgweb import hgweb, wsgicgi
 17 application = hgweb(config)
mercurial undefined, demandimport undefined
&lt;type 'exceptions.ImportError'&gt;: No module named mercurial 
  args = ('No module named mercurial',) 
 
 #4 There's a pretty good post at http://vampirebasic.blogspot.com/2009/06/running-mercurial-on-windows.html that'll get you started, but if you need more detail or to go further than the writer did, I've got a 4 part blog post that covers everything you need to know about getting up and running on IIS, including Active Directory integration, pull/push privileges, customization of the UI:

 It's worth a read... 
 #5 I have just finished setting up Mercurial on IIS6, and suggest going down the ISAPI route, not CGI. I found CGI very unstable. 
He a look at my blog entry : http://hyperionchaos.net/blog , and see if it helps.
