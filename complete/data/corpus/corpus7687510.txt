Question (ID-7687510): python - 'tuple' object does not support item assignment I am using the PIL library. 

 I am trying to make an image look red-er, this is what i've got. 

 from PIL import Image
image = Image.open('balloon.jpg')
pixels = list(image.getdata())
for pixel in pixels: 
 pixel[0] = pixel[0] + 20 
image.putdata(pixels)
image.save('new.bmp')
 

 However I get this error: TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 The second line should have been pixels[0] , with an S. You probably have a tuple named pixel , and tuples are immutable. Construct new pixels instead: 

 image = Image.open('balloon.jpg')

pixels = [(pix[0] + 20,) + pix[1:] for pix in image.getdata()]

image.putdate(pixels)
 
 #1 PIL pixels are tuples, and tuples are immutable. You need to construct a new tuple. So, instead of the for loop, do: 

 pixels = [(pixel[0] + 20, pixel[1], pixel[2]) for pixel in pixels]
image.putdata(pixels)
 

 Also, if the pixel is already too red, adding 20 will overflow the value. You probably want something like max(pixel[0] + 20, 255) or int(255 * (pixel[0] / 255.) ** 0.9) instead of pixel[0] + 20 . 

 And, to be able to handle images in lots of different formats, do image = image.convert("RGB") after opening the image. The convert method will ensure that the pixels are always (r, g, b) tuples. 
 #2 You probably want the next transformation for you pixels: 

 pixels = map(list, image.getdata())
 
 #3 You have misspelt the second pixels as pixel . The following works: 

 pixels = [1,2,3]
pixels[0] = 5
 

 It appears that due to the typo you were trying to accidentally modify some tuple called pixel , and in Python tuples are immutable. Hence the confusing error message. 
 #4 A tuple is immutable and thus you get the error you posted. 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; pixels = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; pixels[0] = 5
&gt;&gt;&gt; pixels = (1, 2, 3)
&gt;&gt;&gt; pixels[0] = 5
Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
 

 In your specific case, as correctly pointed out in other answers, you should write: 

 pixel = (pixel[0] + 20, pixel[1], pixel[2])
 
 #5 Tuples, in python can't have their values changed. If you'd like to change the contained values though I suggest using a list: 

 [1,2,3] not (1,2,3)
