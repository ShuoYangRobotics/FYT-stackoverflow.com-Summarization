Question (ID-4855997): When will Django support Python 3.x? I understand Django can only be run on Python 2.7 or below. When will it run on Python 3.1 or above? I see that Django 1.3 is coming out, does that support Python 3.x? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Currently Django has passed py3k test. 
The last port has been made available at Vinay Sajip repository in BitBucket

 #1 loewis has been working on a port of django to python 3 for a while. 

 https://bitbucket.org/loewis/django-3k 

 On Sept 9th, 2011 jacob (on of the core devs) started the py3k feature branch and pulled these changes in.

 AFAIK, no official release number or date has been set for when django will support python 3. More info on this thread:

 #2 It might run on Python 3 by the end of summer. http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2130853 I don't know if that means "officially" or not, but it doesn't sounds like it, so official support is probably slightly later. 

 The question is why you want to know? You can't run it on Python 3 today. That's all that matters. The day you can run it on python 3, then it matters. Before that it doesn't. [Except to those doing the porting, of course ;-) ]. 

 Predicting the future is easy. It's making the predictions come true that is the hard part. :-) 
 #3 The official FAQ mentions it might take a year or two , but I don't know when was that last revised. 

 I've been trying hard to find exactly where I've read their exact policies on Python support, but based on Django's release process , you can understand that it will take some considerable time as it will likely happen through a major release only. Even if they'd decide to provide Py3k support today , it could take anything from 1 to 4 major releases to deprecate support from Python 2.4 up to Python 2.7.

 Django 1.3 will not run on Python3k. 
 #5 Alex Gaynor thinks about making the port a google summer of code project:
