Question (ID-1432480): Any way to clear python shell? I know there's a similar topic about python console, but I do not know if they are the same. I tried system("clear") and it didn't work here. 

 Thanks! 

 
 Answers (Total-11): #0 os.system('clear') works on linux. If you are running windows try os.system('CLS') instead. 

 You need to import os first like this: 

 import os
 
 #1 The "cls" and "clear" are commands which will clear a terminal (ie a DOS prompt, or terminal window). From your screenshot, you are using the shell within IDLE, which won't be affected by such things. Unfortunately, I don't think there is a way to clear the screen in IDLE. The best you could do is to scroll the screen down lots of lines, eg: 

 print "\n" * 100
 

 Though you could put this in a function: 

 def cls(): print "\n" * 100
 

 And then call it when needed as cls() 
 #2 The way to execute commands in Python 2.4+ is to use the subprocess module. You can use it in the same way that you use os.system . 

 import subprocess
subprocess.call("clear") # linux/mac
subprocess.call("cls", shell=True) # windows
 

 If you're executing this in the python console, you'll need to do something to hide the return value (for either os.system or subprocess.call ), like assigning it to a variable: 

 cls = subprocess.call("cls", shell=True)
 
 #3 There does not appear to be a way to clear the IDLE 'shell' buffer. 
 #4 Your screenshot shows you're using IDLE. cls / clear won't work for you. 
 #5 File -> New Window 

 In the new window** 

 Run -> Python Shell 

 The problem with this method is that it will clear all the things you defined, such as variables. 

 Alternatively, you should just use command prompt. 

 open up command prompt 

 type "cd c:\python27" 

 type "python example.py" , you have to edit this using IDLE when it's not in interactive mode. If you're in python shell, file -> new window. 

 Note that the example.py needs to be in the same directory as C:\python27, or whatever directory you have python installed. 

 Then from here, you just press the UP arrow key on your keyboard. You just edit example.py, use CTRL + S, then go back to command prompt, press the UP arrow key, hit enter. 

 If the command prompt gets too crowded, just type "clr" 

 The "clr" command only works with command prompt, it will not work with IDLE. 
 #6 Try this: os.system("cls") 
 #7 As mark.ribau said, it seems that there is no way to clear the Text widget in idle. One should edit the EditorWindow.py module and add a method and a menu item in the EditorWindow class that does something like: 

 self.text.tag_remove("sel", "1.0", "end")
self.text.delete("1.0", "end")
 

 and perhaps some more tag management of which I'm unaware of. 
 #8 If you want to clear the shell buffer go to shell > restart shell in IDLE. Your question is a little vague. Do you want to clear the shell buffer or are you trying to call the OS command? 
 #9 An extension for clearing the shell can be found in Issue6143 as a "feature request". This extension is included with IdleX . 
 #10 &gt;&gt;&gt; import os

&gt;&gt;&gt;def cls():
... os.system("clear")
...
&gt;&gt;&gt;cls
 

 That does is perfectly. No '0' printed either.
