Question (ID-8653516): Python list of dictionaries search Assume I have this: 

 [
{"name": "Tom", "age": 10},
{"name": "Mark", "age": 5},
{"name": "Pam", "age": 7}
]
 

 and by searching "Pam" as name, I want to retrieve the related dictionary: {name: "Pam", age: 7} 

 How to achieve this ? 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 You can use a generator expression : 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; dicts = [
...  { "name": "Tom", "age": 10 },
...  { "name": "Mark", "age": 5 },
...  { "name": "Pam", "age": 7 }
... ]

&gt;&gt;&gt; (item for item in dicts if item["name"] == "Pam").next()
{'age': 7, 'name': 'Pam'}
 
 #1 My first thought would be that you might want to consider creating a dictionary of these dictionaries ... if, for example, you were going to be searching it more a than small number of times. 

 However that might be a premature optimization. What would be wrong with: 

 def get_records(key, store=dict()):
 '''Return a list of all records containing name==key from our store
 '''
 assert key is not None
 return [d for d in store if d['name']==key]
 
 #2 people = [
{name: "Tom", age: 10},
{name: "Mark", age: 5},
{name: "Pam", age: 7}
]

def search(name):
 for p in people:
  if p['name'] == name:
   return p

search("Pam")
 
 #3 You can use a list comprehension : 

 def search(name, people):
 return [element for element in people if element['name'] == name]
 
 #4 names = [{'name':'Tom', 'age': 10}, {'name': 'Mark', 'age': 5}, {'name': 'Pam', 'age': 7}]
resultlist = [d for d in names  if d['name'] == 'Pam']
first_result = resultlist[0]
 

 This is one way... 
 #5 You have to go through all elements of the list. There is not a shortcut! 

 Unless somewhere else you keep a dictionary of the names pointing to the items of the list, but then you have to take care of the consequences of popping an element from your list. 
 #6 dicts=[
{"name": "Tom", "age": 10},
{"name": "Mark", "age": 5},
{"name": "Pam", "age": 7}
]

from collections import defaultdict
dicts_by_name=defaultdict(list)
for d in dicts:
 dicts_by_name[d['name']]=d

print dicts_by_name['Tom']

#output
#&gt;&gt;&gt;
#{'age': 10, 'name': 'Tom'}
