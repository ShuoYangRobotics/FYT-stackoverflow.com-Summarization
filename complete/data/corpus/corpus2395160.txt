Question (ID-2395160): Python 3.1.1 'else if' Syntax I'm a new Python programmer who is making the leap from 2.6.4 to 3.1.1. Everything has gone fine until I tried to use the 'else if' statement. The interpreter gives me a syntax error after the 'if' in 'else if' for a reason I can't seem to figure out. 

 def function(a):
 if a == '1':
  print ('1a')
 else if a == '2'
  print ('2a')
 else print ('3a')

function(input('input:'))
 

 I'm probably missing something very simple; however, I haven't been able to find the answer on my own. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 In python "else if" is spelled "elif". 

 Also, you need a colon after the elif and the else . 

 Simple answer to a simple question. 

 I had the same problem, when I first started (in the last couple of weeks) 

 So your code should read: 

 def function(a):
 if a == '1':
  print ('1a')
 elif a == '2':
  print ('2a')
 else:
  print ('3a')

function(input('input:'))
 
 #1 Do you mean elif ? 
 #2 Here is a little refactoring of your function (it does not use "else" or "elif"): 

 def function(a):
 if a not in (1, 2):
  a = 3
 print(str(a) + "a")
 

 @ghostdog74: Python3.1.1 requires parentheses for "print". 
 #3 It looks like your missing some colons on the 'else if' and 'else' statements. 
 #4 def function(a):
 if a == '1':
  print ('1a')
 elif a == '2':
  print ('2a')
 else:
  print ('3a')
 
 #5 since olden times, the correct syntax for if/else if in Python is elif . By the way, you can use dictionary if you have alot of if/else .eg 

 d={"1":"1a","2":"2a"}
if not a in d: print("3a")
else: print (d[a])
 

 For msw, example of executing functions using dictionary. 

 def print_one(arg=None):
 print "one"

def print_two(num):
 print "two %s" % num

execfunctions = { 1 : (print_one, ['**arg'] ) , 2 : (print_two , ['**arg'] )}
try:
 execfunctions[1][0]()
except KeyError,e:
 print "Invalid option: ",e

try:
 execfunctions[2][0]("test")
except KeyError,e:
 print "Invalid option: ",e
else:
 sys.exit()
