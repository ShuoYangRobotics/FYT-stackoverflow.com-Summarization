Question (ID-6127317): Anchors in Regex 
 In a Python Regex, must ^ or $
appear just once? 
 I tried to match two lines with 

 ^(.*\|.*)$^.*$
 

 It does not work. How do you match
several lines? 
 

 Note: I am not programming in Python, but using Python-style Regex in my editor gedit. 

 Thanks and regards! 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 As other answers have said, you are looking for re.MULTILINE , but even with that your regex won't work. 

 $ matches the position before the line break, and ^ matches the start of a line, so $^ in the middle of a regex will never match. For example: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; re.search("^(.*)$^.*$", multiline_string, re.M) # won't match
&gt;&gt;&gt; re.search("^(.*)$\n^.*$", multiline_string, re.M) # will match
&lt;_sre.SRE_Match object at 0xb7f3e5e0&gt;
 

 You need something to match the end of line characters between the $ and the ^ . 
 #1 Take a look at re.MULTILINE . 

 I quote: 

 
 When specified, the pattern character
 '^' matches at the beginning of the
 string and at the beginning of each
 line (immediately following each
 newline); and the pattern character
 '$' matches at the end of the string
 and at the end of each line
 (immediately preceding each newline). 
 
 By default, '^' matches only at the
 beginning of the string, and '$' only
 at the end of the string and
 immediately before the newline (if
 any) at the end of the string. 
 
 #2 You have to use re.MULTILINE ( or even re.DOTALL if you change regex and depending on what you actually want to match / do ) 

 
 re.MULTILINE 
 
 When specified, the pattern character
 '^' matches at the beginning
 of the string and at the beginning of
 each line (immediately following each
 newline); and the pattern character
 '$' matches at the end of the string
 and at the end of each line
 (immediately preceding each newline). 
 
 By default, '^' matches only at the
 beginning of the string, and '$' only
 at the end of the string and
 immediately before the newline (if
 any) at the end of the string.

 BTW, what are you doing with - ^(.*\|.*)$^.*$ - that is not a very good regex! ( ignoring the fact that you have the multiple $ and ^ which is the point of the question. ) 
 #3 I would refer to the python regex manual http://docs.python.org/library/re.html#re.MULTILINE 
 #4 Prefixing your regex with (?m) should do what you need (tells the regex engine that it's going to receive multiline texts, and that ^/$ match the beginning/end of a line instead of the whole text). 

 Edit: after looking at your regex a bit more, I think you also need to put (?s), meaning that you want dot to match newline characters. For example: 

 (?m)(?s)^hello.*?world$
 

 correctly matched "helloworld" for me in a case like this: 

 dssdf
hello
world
sdfasdf
 
 #5 To add to other answers. You can get away with putting the re.MULTILINE modifier directly into the regex: 

 (?m)^(.*\|.*)$\n^.*$
