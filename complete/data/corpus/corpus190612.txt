 Answers (Total-17): #0 A search for Python projects at SourceForge.net will offer up a lot of popular, real-world examples. 
 #1 Python's CPAN-like repository is called PyPi , and is chock full of examples! You can browse packages by topic, which is helpful if you know what sort of program you're looking to write. 
 #2 Django webframework 
 #3 The most comprehensive list of Python wins is at the Python web site , under Python Success Stories . 

 Google, Yahoo, Washington Post web site, Plone content management system, Zope portal framework/application, etc. 

 Google and Yahoo originally rolled out much of their functionality written in Python. Where performance was an issue (obviously, the search engine party) they reprogrammed it in C or C++. 

 However, much of the non-performance critical modules today remain written in Python. When you are on these sites checking online help or doing some social/portal thing, take a look in the URL of the page you are looking at and see if there is a ".py" in there somewhere. 

 Google's new Application Engine is 100% Python. It is not just old functionality but also new functionality that is being coded in Python. 

 Google has made their development practices/philosophy pretty transparent to the outside world. They are very knowledgeable people, generally - and their programmers are encouraged to use a language that is a good fit for the software they are creating. 

 Many software projects managed/organized/monitored by Trac. Trac is written in Python. 

 Someone blogged a list of popular Python applications in How Python wins the web . 

 As an aside, Python won readers choice award in 2008 for Favorite Scripting Language. The survey was put out by Linux Journal magazine. 
 #4 Any field in particular? Python is used for a variety of tasks. You could look through the wiki page on applications written in Python . 
 #5 Zope and Plone CMS. 
 #6 Reddit is written in Python. 
 #7 EVE Online uses a variant of Python called Stackless Python , which has proven to be able to take >45000 concurrent users on a single cluster (or shard), which I would consider pretty good for an MMO. 

 Python is used both in the client and on the server.

 Testuff is a software test management tool consisting of a desktop front end built with wxPython, and a REST-based back end built with CherryPy and SQLAlchemy among other things. 

 It's about as real as you can get. 
 #13 Google is an example of a world example written in Python! 
 #14 browsershots.org was completely written in python ;) 
 #15 I was pleasantly surprised to see that Juice (a podcast receiver) is written in Python. It looks like a real Windows app and nothing in the GUI tipped me off to this. I just noticed when looking around in its program directory. 
 #16 The AI and map generation for Civilization 4 are done in Python
