Question (ID-1150897): Emulate processing with python? I'm looking for a basic programmatic animation framework similar to processing except in python. That is, something that allows pixel manipulation, has basic drawing/color primitives, and is geared towards animation. Is pygame pretty much the best bet or are there other options? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 "Similar to processing except in python" screams "NodeBox" to me. NodeBox is OSX-only, and i don't know if it allows pixel-level manipulation, but much of its command set was derived directly from processing. You can find it at the NodeBox site . 
 #1 I prefer pyglet to pygame (but I'm not sure exactly what your needs will be):

 If you need a 3d engine:

 Someone's already mentioned Shoebot, which is probably the closest in spirit to Processing:

 #2 Well, this is as close as it gets: http://code.google.com/p/pyprocessing/ 
 #3 You could get pretty close to processing with vpython: 

 http://vpython.org/ 

 The primitives are very easy to work with, and it is adept at animation. 

 I am not sure what kind of pixel manipulation you are looking for, but there may be something for that as well. 
 #4 There's quite recent C++ library, SFML , which is a good alternative to SDL.
Thus its Python bindings should be a good alternative to Pygame. 
 #5 This blog entry shows how to do processing implementations using Jython.
