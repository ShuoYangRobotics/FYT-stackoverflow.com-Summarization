Question (ID-138502): Pure Python XSLT library Is there an XSLT library that is pure Python? 

 Installing libxml2+libxslt or any similar C libraries is a problem on some of the platforms I need to support. 

 I really only need basic XSLT support, and speed is not a major issue. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Unfortunately there are no pure-python XSLT processors at the moment. If you need something that is more platform independent, you may want to use a Java-based XSLT processor like Saxon . 4Suite is working on a pure-python XPath parser, but it doesn't look like a pure XSLT processor will be out for some time. Perhaps it would be best to use some of Python's functional capabilities to try and approximate the existing stylesheet or look into the feasibility of using Java instead. 
 #1 I don't think you can do it in cpython: there are no pure python XSLT implementations. 

 But you can trivially do it in jython, using the inbuilt XSLT APIs of the JVM. I wrote a blog post for the specific case of doing it on Google AppEngine, but the code given should work under jython in anyn circumstances.

 HTH,

 #2 If you only need basic support, and your XML isn't too crazy, consider removing the XSLT element from the equation and just using a DOM/SAX parser. 

 Here's some info from the PythonInfo Wiki : 

 
 [DOM] sucks up an entire XML file,
 holds it in memory, and lets you work
 with it. Sax, on the other hand, emits
 events as it goes step by step through
 the file. 
 

 What do you think? 
 #3 Have you looked at 4suite ? 
 #4 Try lxml 
 #5 Have a look at minidom
