Question (ID-6940500): parsing text file for a line, in python system generates a text file. it contains more than 100 lines. i like to get a line in the file. 

 some text **
Actions Pending are: Action-1, Action-2,....Action-3 (this is another new line)
some text**
 

 need to get the Actions in pending to array. 

 i used 

 for index in text:
 rc.logMessage(str(index))
 

 it is printing each character at a time not the line. 

 help me how can i parse this file to get actions into an array. 

 Thanks in advance 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Something like: 

 d = """some text **
Actions Pending are: Action-1, Action-2, Action-3
some text**
"""
res = []
for line in re.findall('Actions Pending are: (.+)', d):
 res.extend([action.strip() for action in line.split(',')])
['Action-1', 'Action-2', 'Action-3']
 
 #1 You can try something like this: 

 pendingActions = []
textToSearch = 'Actions Pending are:'
for line in open(filename, 'r'):
 line = line.strip()
 if line and line.startswith(textToSearch):
  pendingActions.extend([x.strip() for x in line[len(textToSearch):].split(',') if x.strip()])
 
 #2 You need to iterate over the file , not a string read from the file. 

 with open(filename) as text:
 for line in text:
   rc.logMessage(some_function_of_the_line(line))
 

 Iterating over the file gives you lines; iterating over a string gives you characters / bytes. 
 #3 You want str.splitlines() http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#str.splitlines 

 for index in text:
 rc.logMessage(str(index))
 

 becomes: 

 for index in text.splitlines():
 rc.logMessage(str(index))
 
 #4 Try something like this 

 with file("your_file") as logfile:
 result = [line for line in logfile if line.startswith("Actions pending")]
 

 This way in result you will have all the actions lines. 
 #5  search_string = 'Actions Pending are: '
 for line in open('yourfile.txt', 'r').readlines():
  if line.startswith(search_string):
  actions = line[len(search_string):].split(',')
  break
 print actions
 

 Artsiom was faster: parsing text file for a line, in python , maybe my version is more readable.
