Question (ID-4929251): Can you step through python code to help debug issues? In java/c# you can easily step through code to trace what might be going wrong, and IDE's make this process very user friendly. 

 Can you trace through python code in a similiar fashion? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Yes! There's a Python debugger called pdb just for doing that! 

 You can launch a Python program through pdb by using pdb myscript.py or python -m pdb myscript.py . 

 There are a few commands you can then issue, which are documented on the pdb page. 

 Some useful ones to remember are: 

 
 b : set a breakpoint 
 c : continue debugging until you hit a breakpoint 
 s : step through the code 
 l : list all the variables in the current scope 
 u : navigate up a stack frame 
 d : navigate down a stack frame 
 

 If you don't want to use a command line debugger, some IDEs like Pydev have a GUI debugger. 
 #1  pdb 
 #2 There is a module called 'pdb' in python. At the top of your python script you do 

 import pdb
pdb.set_trace()
 

 and you will enter into debugging mode. You can use 's' to step, 'n' to follow next line similar to what you would do with 'gdb' debugger. 
 #3 You can look at python debugger which does exactly what you're looking for only not through a GUI 
 #4 If you want an IDE with integrated debugger, try PyScripter . 
 #5 If you come from Java/C# background I guess your best bet would be to use Eclipse with Pydev . This gives you a fully functional IDE with debugger built in. I use it with django as well.
