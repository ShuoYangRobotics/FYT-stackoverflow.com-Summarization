Question (ID-2486145): python: check if url to jpg exists In python, how would I check if a url ending in .jpg exists? 

 ex:
 http://www.fakedomain.com/fakeImage.jpg 

 thanks 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 &gt;&gt;&gt; import httplib
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; def exists(site, path):
...  conn = httplib.HTTPConnection(site)
...  conn.request('HEAD', path)
...  response = conn.getresponse()
...  conn.close()
...  return response.status == 200
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; exists('http://www.fakedomain.com', '/fakeImage.jpg')
False
 

 If the status is anything other than a 200, the resource doesn't exist at the URL. This doesn't mean that it's gone altogether. If the server returns a 301 or 302, this means that the resource still exists, but at a different URL. To alter the function to handle this case, the status check line just needs to be changed to return response.status in (200, 301, 302) . 
 #1 Looks like http://www.fakedomain.com/fakeImage.jpg automatically redirected to http://www.fakedomain.com/index.html without any error. 

 Redirecting for 301 and 302 responses are automatically done without giving any response back to user. 

 Please take a look HTTPRedirectHandler , you might need to subclass it to handle that. 

 Here is the one sample from diveintopython.org

 #2 I think you can try send a http request to the url and read the response.If no exception was caught,it probably exists. 
 #3 I don't know why you are doing this, but in any case: it should be noted that just because a request to an "image" succeeds, doesn't mean it is what you think it is (it could redirect to anything, or return any data of any type, and potentially cause problems depending on what you do with the response). 

 Sorry, I went on a binge reading about online exploits and how to defend against them today :P 
 #4 Try it with mechanize : 

 import mechanize
br = mechanize.Browser()
br.set_handle_redirect(False)
try:
 br.open_novisit('http://www.fakedomain.com/fakeImage.jpg')
 print 'OK'
except:
 print 'KO'
 
 #5 thanks for all the responses everyone, ended up using the following: 

 try:
 f = urllib2.urlopen(urllib2.Request(url))
 deadLinkFound = False
except:
 deadLinkFound = True
