Question (ID-579687): How do I copy a string to the clipboard on Windows using Python? Hey there, I'm kind of new to Python and I'm trying to make a basic application that builds a string out of user input then adds it to the win32 clipboard. I'm having a problem passing the string to the clipboard. 

 What am I doing wrong? 

 Here's my code example:

 Answers (Total-6): #0 Actually, pywin32 and ctypes seem to be an overkill for this simple task. Tkinter is a cross-platform GUI framework, which ships and installs with Python (by default) and has clipboard accessing methods among with other cool stuff. 

 If all you need is to put some text to system clipboard, this will do it: 

 from Tkinter import Tk
r = Tk()
r.withdraw()
r.clipboard_clear()
r.clipboard_append('i can has clipboardz?')
r.destroy()
 

 And that's all, no need to mess around with platform-specific third-party libraries. 
 #1 Looks like you need to add win32clipboard to your site-packages. It's part of the pywin32 package 
 #2 You can also use ctypes to tap into the windows API and avoid the massive pywin32 package. This is what I use, (excuse the poor style, but the idea is there.) 

 import ctypes

#Get required functions, strcpy..
strcpy = ctypes.cdll.msvcrt.strcpy
ocb = ctypes.windll.user32.OpenClipboard #Basic Clipboard functions
ecb = ctypes.windll.user32.EmptyClipboard
gcd = ctypes.windll.user32.GetClipboardData
scd = ctypes.windll.user32.SetClipboardData
ccb = ctypes.windll.user32.CloseClipboard
ga = ctypes.windll.kernel32.GlobalAlloc # Global Memory allocation
gl = ctypes.windll.kernel32.GlobalLock  # Global Memory Locking
gul = ctypes.windll.kernel32.GlobalUnlock
GMEM_DDESHARE = 0x2000 

def Get( ):
 ocb(None) # Open Clip, Default task

 pcontents = gcd(1) # 1 means CF_TEXT.. too lazy to get the token thingy ... 

 data = ctypes.c_char_p(pcontents).value

 #gul(pcontents) ?
 ccb()

 return data

def Paste( data ):
 ocb(None) # Open Clip, Default task

 ecb()

 hCd = ga( GMEM_DDESHARE, len( bytes(data,"ascii") )+1 )

 pchData = gl(hCd)

 strcpy(ctypes.c_char_p(pchData),bytes(data,"ascii"))

 gul(hCd)

 scd(1,hCd)

 ccb()
 
 #3 Do you have the extensions installed? 
 #4 What Options do I have with Python 2.5 ?
I want to put stuff into the clipboard from Maya 2009 on Win7 . 

 The Tk thing fails on import: Module was not found: 

 File "C:\Program Files (x86)\Autodesk\Maya2009\bin\python25.zip\lib-tk\Tkinter.py", line 38, in &lt;module&gt;
ImportError: DLL load failed: Das angegebene Modul wurde nicht gefunden. # 
 

 In the py-file it reads: 

 import _tkinter # If this fails your Python may not be configured for Tk
 

 ctypes works up to the point where bytes() is used. Its probably not in 2.5 right? 

 Installing modules is not a good option I'd want this to work on the stations of my co-workers to without having them to install something. 
 #5 pardon me. No I don't have them installed and I'd actually need it without anything extra installed :/ 

 I use a little exe-compiled Autohotkey helper script now. Its maybe not elegant but SO easy that way!
