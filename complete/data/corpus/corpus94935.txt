Question (ID-94935): What is the difference between range and xrange? Apparently xrange is faster but I have no idea why it's faster (and no proof besides the anecdotal so far that it is faster) or what besides that is different about 

 for i in range(0, 20):
for i in xrange(0, 20):
 
 Answers (Total-12): #0 range creates a list, so if you do range(1, 10000000) it creates a list in memory with 10000000 elements. 

 xrange is a generator, so it evaluates lazily.

 This is true, but in Python 3, range will be replaced with xrange(). If you need to actually generate the list, you will need to do: 

 list(range(1,100))
 
 #2 xrange only stores the range params and generates the numbers on demand. However the C implementation of Python currently restricts its args to C longs: 

 xrange(2**32-1, 2**32+1) # OverflowError: cannot convert to int
range(2**32-1, 2**32+1) # OK --&gt; [4294967295L, 4294967296L]
 

 Note that in Python 3.0 there is only range and it behaves exactly like the 2.x xrange . 
 #3 xrange returns an iterator and only keeps one number in memory at a time. range keeps the entire list of numbers in memory. 
 #4 Remember, use the timeit module to test which of small snipps of code is faster! 

 $ python -m timeit 'for i in range(1000000):' ' pass'
10 loops, best of 3: 90.5 msec per loop
$ python -m timeit 'for i in xrange(1000000):' ' pass'
10 loops, best of 3: 51.1 msec per loop
 

 Personally, I always use range(), unless I were dealing with really huge lists -- as you can see, time-wise, for a list of a million entries, the extra overhead is only 0.04 seconds. And as Corey points out, in Python 3.0 xrange will go away and range will give you nice iterator behaviour anyway. 
 #5 Do spend some time with the Library Reference . The more familiar you are with it, the faster you can find answers to questions like this. Especially important are the first few chapters about builtin objects and types. 

 
 The advantage of the xrange type is that an xrange object will always 
 take the same amount of memory, no matter the size of the range it represents. 
 There are no consistent performance advantages. 
 

 Another way to find quick information about a Python construct is the docstring and the help-function: 

 print xrange.__doc__ # def doc(x): print x.__doc__ is super useful
help(xrange)
 
 #6 see here . 
 #7 range generates the entire list and returns it. xrange does not -- it generates the numbers in the list on demand. 
 #8 xrange uses an iterator (generates values on the fly), range returns a list. 
 #9 It is for optimization reasons. 

 range() will create a list of values from start to end (0 .. 20 in your example). This will become an expensive operation on very large ranges. 

 xrange() on the other hand is much more optimised. it will only compute the next value when needed (via an xrange sequence object) and does not create a list of all values like range() does. 
 #10 
 range creates a list, so if you do range(1, 10000000) it creates a list in memory with 10000000 elements.
 xrange is a generator, so it evaluates lazily. 
 

 This brings you two advantages: 

 
 You can iterate longer lists without getting a stackoverflow error. 
 As it resolves each number lazily, if you skip the iteration early, you wont have the penalization of the creation of the whole list. 
 
 #11 When testing range against xrange in a loop (I know I should use timeit , but this was swiftly hacked up from memory using a simple list comprehension example) I found the following: 

 import time

for x in range(1, 10):

 t = time.time()
 [v*10 for v in range(1, 10000)]
 print "range: %.4f" % ((time.time()-t)*100)

 t = time.time()
 [v*10 for v in xrange(1, 10000)]
 print "xrange: %.4f" % ((time.time()-t)*100)
 

 which gives: 

 $python range_tests.py
range: 0.4273
xrange: 0.3733
range: 0.3881
xrange: 0.3507
range: 0.3712
xrange: 0.3565
range: 0.4031
xrange: 0.3558
range: 0.3714
xrange: 0.3520
range: 0.3834
xrange: 0.3546
range: 0.3717
xrange: 0.3511
range: 0.3745
xrange: 0.3523
range: 0.3858
xrange: 0.3997 &lt;- garbage collection?
 

 Or, using xrange in the for loop: 

 range: 0.4172
xrange: 0.3701
range: 0.3840
xrange: 0.3547
range: 0.3830
xrange: 0.3862 &lt;- garbage collection?
range: 0.4019
xrange: 0.3532
range: 0.3738
xrange: 0.3726
range: 0.3762
xrange: 0.3533
range: 0.3710
xrange: 0.3509
range: 0.3738
xrange: 0.3512
range: 0.3703
xrange: 0.3509
 

 Is my snippet testing properly? Any comments on the slower instance of xrange? Or a better example :-)
