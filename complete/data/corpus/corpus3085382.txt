Question (ID-3085382): python How can I strip first and last double quotes I want to strip double quotes from 

 string = '"" " " ""\\1" " "" ""'
 

 to become 

 string = '" " " ""\\1" " "" "'
 

 I tried to use rstrip, lstrip and strip('[^\"]|[\"$]') but it did not work. 

 How can I do this?
Thank you for helping me. 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 If the quotes you want to strip are always going to be "first and last" as you said, then you could simply use: 

 string = string[1:-1] 
 #1 If you can't assume that all the strings you process have double quotes you can use something like this: 

 if string.startswith('"') and string.endswith('"'):
 string = string[1:-1]
 

 Edit: 

 I'm sure that you just used string as the variable name for exemplification here and in your real code it has a useful name, but I feel obliged to warn you that there is a module named string in the standard libraries. It's not loaded automatically, but if you ever use import string make sure your variable doesn't eclipse it. 
 #2 If string is always as you show: 

 string[1:-1]
 
 #3 If you are sure there is a " at the beginning and at the end, which you want to remove, just do: 

 string = string[1:len(string)-1]
 

 or 

 string = string[1:-1]
 
 #4 To remove the first and last characters, and in each case do the removal only if the character in question is a double quote: 

 import re

s = re.sub(r'^"|"$', '', s)
 

 Note that the RE pattern is different than the one you had given, and the operation is sub ("substitute") with an empty replacement string ( strip is a string method but does something pretty different from your requirements, as other answers have indicated). 
 #5 find the position of the first and the last " in your string 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; s = '"" " " ""\\1" " "" ""'
&gt;&gt;&gt; l = s.find('"')
&gt;&gt;&gt; r = s.rfind('"')

&gt;&gt;&gt; s[l+1:r]
'" " " ""\\1" " "" "'
 
 #6 Almost done. Quoting from http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=strip#str.strip 

 
 The chars argument is a string
 specifying the set of characters to be
 removed. 
 

 [...] 

 
 The chars argument is not a prefix or
 suffix; rather, all combinations of
 its values are stripped: 
 

 So the argument is not a regexp. 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; string = '"" " " ""\\1" " "" ""'
&gt;&gt;&gt; string.strip('"')
' " " ""\\1" " "" '
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
 

 Note, that this is not exactly what you requested, because it eats multiple quotes from both end of the string!
