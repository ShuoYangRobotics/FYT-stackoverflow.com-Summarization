Question (ID-551950): What stackless programming languages are available? What stackless programming languages are available? 

 I know of Stackless Python , but are there any other languages which do not rely on a C stack that can be embedded into other applications? 

 List of stackless programming languages: 

 
 Stackless Python 
 PyPy by climatewarrior 
 Lua by Van Gale 
 Tcl by Martin Drapeau 
 Lisp and Scheme by John Fouhy 
 Parrot VM

 Scheme 
 Tcl 
 Lua 
 Parrot VM 
 
 #1 PyPy is another Python implementation that can be stackless. 
 #2 TCL 8.6 is also stackless. 
 #3 Stackless Python is not actually stackless. The original implementation was, but maintaining it was cumbersome and the benefits were negligible. The current implementation is as stackbound as standard C Python is. 
 #4 Lisp or scheme? 

 There seem to be some references here: http://objectmix.com/compilers/706608-stackless-compilers.html 
 #5 Not really sure, but I seem to remember that Lua moved to a register based VM from the traditional stack based VM. Lua is very easy to embed. 

 I'm not to familiar with the details, though.
