Question (ID-3823577): Python cloud hosting other than Google App Engine? What options exist for Python Cloud Hosting other than Google App Engine? 

 I'm looking for solutions that let me write and publish code to servers that will scale up automatically to meet demand. I don't want to spend my time on IT tasks. 

 So far, I've really only found this: https://www.picloud.com/ 

 App Engine is great, but has some immaturity limitations such as lack of https support. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Google App Engine is a very unique cloud platform and you won't find any other similar hosting. Except maybe hosting your own AppScale platform somewhere : http://code.google.com/p/appscale/ 
But I don't think it's ready yet. 

 The closest to GAE would likely be some sort of Heroku-clone for Python. I know of two upcoming services : 

 
 http://www.djangy.com 
 http://stable.io 
 

 You could also try Media Temple Grid Service which has Django grid containers : http://mediatemple.net/webhosting/gs/features/containers.php#django 
 #1 If you're looking for python website / webservice hosting, there are now (a year on from OP) a couple of beta options that look interesting (these may be in production versions by the time this answer is read!) 

 http://ep.io (any python hosting)
 http://gondor.io (django hosting) 

 these are similar to GAE, but offer traditional back ends - RDBMS (PostGRES). 

 However picloud and http://www.pythonanywhere.com/ are quite different in that they offer the ability to run and retrieve arbitrary python code in the cloud (no need for an explicit wsgi-built api). 
 #2 How about : http://www.picloud.com/ 
 #3 You could consider something like AppScale or TyphoonAE: 

 http://code.google.com/p/appscale/ 

 http://code.google.com/p/typhoonae/ 

 These are independent and open-source implementations of GAE that can be hosted anywhere you want, and that allow you to get around some of the issues with GAE (e.g. the HTTPS issue you mentioned). 

 Both support GAE/P but AppScale's Python support is a few versions behind. 
 #4 You can now use Heroku for Python. 
 #5 https://www.dotcloud.com/ might also work for your needs
