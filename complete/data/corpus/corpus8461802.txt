Question (ID-8461802): List a files in python and save it I can't save this output, maybe someone have the solution. I'm listing a directory and some singles files. But when I save the output just catch the directory files, and Not the singles files. 
My code: 

 import os
tosave = open('/tmp/list','ab')
thesource = ["/etc/ssh","/var/log/syslog","/etc/hosts"]
for f in thesource:
 print f
 for top, dirs, files in os.walk(f):
  for nm in files:
   print os.path.join(top, nm)
   try:
    tosave.write(top+nm+'\n')
   finally:
    tosave.close
 

 I saw in the console all files and directory, but in the saved list, just ssh files. Why didn't save syslog and hosts too? 

 Thank you !! 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 You could try adding tosave.flush() at the end. It does cause problems sometimes. Sometimes, a flush call is required to empty the contents of the buffer into the file. 
 #1 Check if this works for you 

 import os
tosave = open('/tmp/list','ab')
thesource = ["/etc/ssh","/var/log/syslog","/etc/hosts"]
for f in thesource:
 if os.path.isdir(f):
  for top, dirs, files in os.walk(f):
   for nm in files:
    try:
     tosave.write(top+nm+'\n')
 if os.path.isfile(f):
  tosave.write(f+'\n')
to.close()
 
 #2 In case you missed the () at tosave.close while pasting: (otherwise check harsh's answer ) 

 The finally is wrong here. The code in finally will be executed after the try block, so after the first execution of tosave.write(top+nm+'\n') the file will be closed because of tosave.close() . 

 Possibly you intended to use except : 

    # snip
   try:
    tosave.write(top+nm+'\n')
   except:
    tosave.close()
 

 

 Edit: To answer your comment, you want the last line to be the same as the print statement: 

     tosave.write(os.path.join(top, nm) + '\n')
 
 #3 With all your help I found a solution and it's working. I share it. 

 tosave = open('/tmp/list','ab')
 thesource = ["/etc/ssh","/var/log/syslog","/etc/hosts"]
for f in thesource:
 if os.path.isfile(f):
  print f
  tosave.write(f+'\n')
 else:
  for top, dirs, files in os.walk(f):
   for nm in files:
    print os.path.join(top, nm)
    tosave.write(top+nm+'\n')
 

 Thank you all for your help !!! 
 #4 Maybe this is because you're opening the file in append mode (the 'a' ) and then looking at its beginning? Look at its end - you might see your new files listed there. 

 In append mode, each time the script runs it appends its output to the file. Usually what one wants is just the write mode ( 'w' instead of 'a' ), which overwrites the file each time. 
 #5 In this line you're writing strings to the file: 

 tosave.write(top+nm+'\n')
 

 You need to open the files and read them in order to write to another file: 

 tosave.write(open(os.path.join(top, nm), 'rb').read())
 

 But I'm guessing you will have to deal with: IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: ... 
 #6 Put the close() at the end of the script. 

 Otherwise it will close the file after the first step in the loop, making the file unwritable.
