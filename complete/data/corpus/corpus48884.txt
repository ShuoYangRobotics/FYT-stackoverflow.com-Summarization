Question (ID-48884): Amazon API library for Python? What Python libraries do folks use for querying Amazon product data? (Amazon Associates Web Service - used to be called E-Commerce API, or something along those lines). 

 Based on my research, PyAWS ( http://pyaws.sourceforge.net/ ) seems okay, but still pretty raw (and hasn't been updated in a while). Wondering if there's an obvious canonical library that I'm just missing. 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 There is now another alternative: python-amazon-product-api . It supports API version 2009-11-01 2010-12-01. 
 #1 I'm using Bottlenose , Dan Loewenherz's "super awesome Python wrapper for the Amazon Product Advertising API". It doesn't parse the XML, so I'm using lxml.objectify : 

 AWS_KEY = "..."
SECRET_KEY = "..."

import bottlenose
amazon = bottlenose.Amazon(AWS_KEY, SECRET_KEY)
response=amazon.ItemLookup(ItemId="B0018AFK38", ResponseGroup="OfferSummary")

from lxml import objectify
root = objectify.fromstring(response)
root.Items.Item.OfferSummary.LowestNewPrice.FormattedPrice
 
 #2 PyAWS is no longer hosted on SourceForge. The latest version (0.3.0) is available via the authors website . 

 Make sure you also grab the patch for Amazons latest API changes, mentioned in the comments. 
 #3 pyaws seems to be the best one out there. I used it here ( my source code ) It worked fine for me. 
 #4 The only other library I'm aware of is pyAmazon , which is the predecessor of pyaws. If you're familiar with the Amazon API (or are willing to become so), you could probably put together something yourself with ZSI . 
 #5 pyaws is the best in my opinion. The most available version is 0.2.0, but there is also a version 0.3.0 that is somewhat harder to find. The best maintained version of it that I have found though, which is based on 0.3.0, is on bitbucket . 
 #6 How about boto ? Anyone have any experience with it? I just started looking for a Python package for Amazon and boto looks up to date (v1.8c release 28-Jun-2009), active and complete (has a long list of supported interfaces).
