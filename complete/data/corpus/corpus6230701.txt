Question (ID-6230701): "if var and var2 == getSomeValue()" in python - if the first is false, is the second statement evaluated?' I have some code like this: 

 if var:
 if var2 == getSomeValue()
 

 This could be in a single expression. 

 if var and var2 == getSomeValue():
 

 ...but getSomeValue() can only be called if var is True. 

 So, when calling if var and var2 == getSomeValue() , are both evaluated by the interpreter, or the evaluation stops at var if False ? Where I can find this information on python documentation? (I didn't know what to search...:/ ) 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 This is called short-circuiting, and Python does it, so you're good. 

 UPDATE: Here's a quick example. 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; def foo():
...  print "Yay!"
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; if True and foo() is None:
...  print "indeed"
... 
Yay!
indeed
&gt;&gt;&gt; if False and foo() is None:
...  print "nope"
... 
 

 UPDATE 2: Putting the relevant PEP (308) in my answer so it doesn't get overlooked in the excellent comment from @Somebody still uses you MS-DOS. 
 #1 The second item isn't evaluated - you could verify this with a simple program: 

 def boo():
 print "hi"
 return True

a = False
b = True

if a and b == boo():
 print "hi2"
 

 Running it produces no output, so you can see that boo() is never called. 
 #2 If var is False , evaluation stops. 

 See the Short-Circuit Behavior section in PEP 308 . 
 #3 The evaluation getSomeValue won't be evaluated: 

 var = False
if var and foo():
 print "here"
else:
 print "there"

def foo():
 print "In foo"
 return False
 
 #4 The Python documentation says that and and or are short-circuiting, so no, var2 == getSomeValue() won't be evaluated if var is false. 
 #5 Re " I didn't know what to search " 

 You don't need to search when there's an index available: 

 Browse to the Python home page . Successively click on 

 
 DOCUMENTATION 
 Current Docs 
 index (it's in the top right corner) 
 A 
 

 Scroll down until you see 

 and
 bitwise
 operator
 

 You don't want bitwise , click on operator . 

 If you are on Windows, you have the manuals on your computer, with a nice-enough GUI interface. Check out the Contents / Index / Search / Favorites panes near the top left corner.
