Question (ID-5537268): Django Admin Page missing CSS I saw this question and recommendation from Django Projects here but still can't get this to work. My Django Admin pages are not displaying the CSS at all. 

 

 This is my current configuration. 

 settings.py 

 ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX = '/media/admin/'
 

 httpd.conf 

 &lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
 DocumentRoot /home/django/sgel
 ServerName ec2-***-**-***-***.ap-**********-1.compute.amazonaws.com
 ErrorLog /home/django/sgel/logs/apache_error.log
 CustomLog /home/django/sgel/logs/apache_access.log combined
 WSGIScriptAlias / /home/django/sgel/apache/django.wsgi

 &lt;Directory /home/django/sgel/media&gt;
  Order deny,allow
  Allow from all
 &lt;/Directory&gt;

 &lt;Directory /home/django/sgel/apache&gt;
  Order deny,allow
  Allow from all
 &lt;/Directory&gt;

 LogLevel warn

 Alias /media/ /home/django/sgel/media/

&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
 ServerName sgel.com
 Redirect permanent / http://www.sgel.com/
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
 

 In addition, I also ran the following to create (I think) the symbolic link
 ln -s /home/djangotest/sgel/media/admin/ /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/django/contrib/admin/media/ 

 UPDATE 

 In my httpd.conf file, 

 User django
Group django
 

 When I run ls -l in my /media directory 

 drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Apr 4 11:03 admin
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 9 Apr 8 09:02 test.txt
 

 Should that root user be django instead? 

 UPDATE 2 
When I enter ls -la in my /media/admin folder 

 total 12
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Apr 13 03:33 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Apr 8 09:02 ..
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 60 Apr 13 03:33 media -&gt; /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/django/contrib/admin/media/
 

 The thing is, when I navigate to /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/django/contrib/admin/media/ , the folder was empty. So I copied the CSS, IMG and JS folders from my Django installation into /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/django/contrib/admin/media/ and it still didn't work 
 Answers (Total-12): #0 There's a couple of problems here, both to do with your symbolic link. 

 Firstly, the source and target needed to be the other way round (I always get that wrong myself). 

 Secondly, you have used a completely different path to the one you've specified in your Apache conf - djangotest/sgelections vs django/sgel . 

 Do it like this: 

 cd /home/django/sgel/media/
ln -s /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/django/contrib/admin/media/ admin
 
 #1 In addition to correcting the symbolic link as Daniel Roseman suggested, you'll need to make sure that the user that is running Apache has read access to the admin media. 

 
 If you do ls -l in your media directory, do you see the symbolic link? 
 If you cd admin from your media directory, does it work? If you then run ls can you see the admin media? 
 Does the user that runs Apache have read access to the admin media? 
 

 If all those things work, then please update your question with your current configuration and results of those commands and we'll take another look. 

 Response to Update : Ok, the permissions look ok. It looks like you've got the directory structure in your media directory a little bit wrong. 

 The fact that /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/django/contrib/admin/media/ was empty is disturbing, too. Once you solve the immediate problem you may want to look into reinstall django in the expected place. 

 Anyways, here's how the structure should look: 

 $ cd media
$ ls -la
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Apr 13 03:33 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Apr 8 09:02 ..
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 60 Apr 13 03:33 admin -&gt; /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/django/contrib/admin/media/
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 9 Apr 8 09:02 test.txt
 

 That is, inside of the media/ directory their should be a link called admin directly to the /admin/media directory of your django installation. 

 To fix what you've got, inside of the media/admin/ directory run: 

 rm media
cd ..
rmdir admin
 

 and then re-create the symlink as suggested in Daniel Roseman's answer. 
 #2 Try to add 

 Options FollowSymLinks
 

 to your 

 &lt;Directory /home/django/sgel/media&gt;
 Order deny,allow
 Allow from all
&lt;/Directory&gt;
 

 so that you end up with 

 &lt;Directory /home/django/sgel/media&gt;
 Options FollowSymLinks
 Order deny,allow
 Allow from all
&lt;/Directory&gt;
 
 #3 i used to have the same problem, i solved it by using the FireFox plugin firebug, which tells you where is your site looking for the media files, also how did you check the contents of the admin/media folder to see if they were empty ? 
 #4 In Firebug, use the Net tab and see the requests being made by your browser for the css files. see the response for your requests there itself. I think you will find the problem there. 
I recently had the same problem. The problem was when my browser requests for the css files, the response contained the contents of my project's login html page. I don't remember now that how i solved my problem. I will try to recollect and post the solution here. 
Let me know if you have the same problem. 
 #5 can you run 

 pyton
&gt;&gt;&gt; import django
&gt;&gt;&gt; print django.__file__
 

 the other question - does your normal media placed into the /home/django/sgel/media/ work (i.e. served by apache as expected?) 
 #6 I'm not sure if this will help but in my config file I have: 

  Alias /adminmedia/ /var/lib/python-support/python2.6/django/contrib/admin/media/ 

 &lt;Directory "/var/lib/python-support/python2.6/django/contrib/admin/media"&gt; 
   AllowOverride None             
   Options FollowSymLinks            
   Order allow,deny             
   Allow from all              
 &lt;/Directory&gt;
 

 It works but I have my server set up for development/testing only. 
 #7 Did you try setting the value for 

 MEDIA_ROOT 
MEDIA_URL 
ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX 

 correctly? 

 I mean that the MEDIA_ROOT url and ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFX should have a different value. Please check these values in your settings.py and try again. 

 Hope this helps. 
 #8 I encountered the same problem while running the Bitnami Django Stack on Win32 (builtin development server) 

 I solved the issue by finding the missing CSS folders in the installation and changing settings.py. 

 # Additional locations of static files
STATICFILES_DIRS = (
 'C:/Program Files/BitNami DjangoStack/apps/django/django/contrib',
)
 

 This will help you get started developing... It's not optimal. Don't forget the trailing comma :) 
 #9 Another method I just found, and it looks like a properly supported method. 

 Make sure you have the staticfiles module in your settings. Also configure the STATIC_ROOT option. 

 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/staticfiles/#module-django.contrib.staticfiles 

 Create your /static/ folder and set permissions. 

 Configure apache with a /static/ alias. 

 alias /static &lt;path to project root&gt;/static/
&lt;Directory "&lt;path to project root&gt;/static/"&gt;
 Order deny,allow
 Allow from all
&lt;/Directory&gt;
 

 then from your project folder run 

 sudo python manage.py collectstatic [-n to do a dry run]
 

 All this looks like it does is copy the admin static files to your projects folder for web serving. 
 #10 I know it's been solved but I think it's worthy to share my solution. 

 I simply added the alias in apache and it worked so far. 

  Alias /static/admin/ /usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/django/contrib/admin/media/
 Alias admin/media/ /usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/django/contrib/admin/media/
 
 #11 If nothing helps, add the following in urls.py 

 url(r'^media/(?P.*)$', 'django.views.static.serve', { 
   'document_root': '/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/django/contrib/admin/media/', 
   'show_indexes' : True, 
  }), 

 This is independent of apache or nginx :)
