Question (ID-2819832): Is there an intelligent editor for ReST files? I'm just learning Sphinx, and I need to edit ReST files. Is there an intelligent editor for it? Like, an editor that gives me code coloration, easy indentation, code completion (hopefully), etc. 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 Emacs with rst-mode: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/emacs.html 
 #1 vi is very good at this. I was just editing some .rst files right now and it colors the headings, monospaced text, etc. The macros let you very quickly turn text into headings and whatnot. 
 #2 jEdit also has ReST highlighting, but no ReST specific auto-completion features (it does support macros though). 

 I would opt for vim or Cream, personally. 
 #3 Leo does some of this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_%28text_editor%

 #4 Gedit has a ReST plugin which supports syntax highlighting, keyboard shortcuts ("snippets"), and HTML preview.

 #5 I use vim and have some useful mappings in my .vimrc: 

 nnoremap &lt;leader&gt;1 yypVr=
nnoremap &lt;leader&gt;2 yypVr- 
nnoremap &lt;leader&gt;3 yypVr'
nnoremap &lt;leader&gt;4 yypVr`
vmap &lt;silent&gt; &lt;leader&gt;b :call BulletList()&lt;cr&gt;

" Bullet List
function! BulletList()
 let lineno = line(".")
 call setline(lineno, "* " . getline(lineno))
endfunction
 

 And often create vim macros on th fly depending on the file I have to restructure 
 #6 There is also a rst mode for the Jed editor:
