Question (ID-2305026): Is there a open-search solution for python? lucene-like would be preferred. 

 thanks 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Why you need lucene-like when you can use lucene (PyLucene) :) 

 http://lucene.apache.org/pylucene/ 

 It is great and builds against the latest build of lucene 

 quote from site: 

 
 PyLucene is a Python extension for
 accessing Java Lucene. Its goal is to
 allow you to use Lucene's text
 indexing and searching capabilities
 from Python. It is API compatible with
 the latest version of Java Lucene,
 version 2.9.0 as of October 13th,
 2009. 
 
 PyLucene is not a Lucene port but a
 Python wrapper around Java Lucene.
 PyLucene embeds a Java VM with Lucene
 into a Python process. The PyLucene
 Python extension, a Python module
 called lucene, is machine-generated by
 JCC. 
 
 PyLucene is built with JCC, a C++ code
 generator that makes it possible to
 call into Java classes from Python via
 Java's Native Invocation Interface
 (JNI). Sources for JCC are included
 with the PyLucene sources. 
 
 #1 You can also check ElasticSearch , it has native JSON interface so integrating with it in python should be simpler. Seems like Simon Willison things it got potential... 
 #2 See SolPython and solrpy 

 
 What is solrpy? 
 
 solrpy is a python client for solr, an
 enterprise search server built on top
 of lucene. solrpy allows you to add
 documents to a solr instance, and then
 to perform queries and gather search
 results from solr using your favorite
 programming language--python. 
 
 #3 How about python bindings for Lucene ? 
 #4 How about Sphinx? http://www.sphinxsearch.com/ 

 It has Python bindings included.
I don't have comparision with other solutions like Lucene, 
but I'm using Sphinx for CRM and it works very well, 
indexing emails, notes etc. 
 #5 Xapian is an excellent Lucene-alternative, with fairly good Python-bindings, which is also easier to install than pylucene.
