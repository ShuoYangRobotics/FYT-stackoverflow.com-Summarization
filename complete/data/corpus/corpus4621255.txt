Question (ID-4621255): How do I run a python program in the Command Prompt in Windows 7? I'm [relatively] new to python. I'm trying to figure out how to run python programs with the Command Prompt on Windows 7. (I should have figured this out by now...) 

 When I typed "python" into the command prompt, I got the following error: 

 
 'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
 operable program or batch file. 
 

 The first place I found when looking for help was this site: http://docs.python.org/faq/windows.html#how-do-i-run-a-python-program-under-windows . 

 It was somewhat helpful, but the tutorial was written for Windows 2000 and older, so it was minimally helpful for my Windows 7 machine. I attempted the following: 

 
 For older versions of Windows the easiest way to do this is to edit the C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT >file. You would want to add a line like the following to AUTOEXEC.BAT: 
 

 This file did not exist on my machine (unless I'm mistaken). 

 Next, I tried this: (here: How do I run a Python program? ) 

 
 Putting Python In Your Path 
 
 Windows 
 
 In order to run programs, your operating system looks in various places, and tries to match the name of the program / command you typed with some programs along the way. 
 
 In windows: 
 
 control panel > system > advanced > |Environmental Variables| > system variables -> Path 
 
 this needs to include: C:\Python26; (or equivalent). If you put it at the front, it will be the first place looked. You can also add it at the end, which is possibly saner. 
 
 Then restart your prompt, and try typing 'python'. If it all worked, you should get a ">>>" prompt. 
 

 This was relevant enough for Windows 7, and I made my way to the System Variables. I added a variable "python" with the value "C:\Python27" 

 I continued to get the error, even after restarting my computer. 

 Anyone know how to fix this? 
 Answers (Total-8): #0 You need to add C:\Python27 to your PATH variable, not a new variable named "python". 

 Find the PATH variable (using the method you posted), then modify the system PATH variable by adding a ; (which is the delimiter) and the path C:\Python27 at the end. 

 The PATH variable lists all the locations that Windows (and cmd.exe ) will check when given the name of a command, e.g. "python" (it also uses the PATHEXT variable for a list of executable file extensions to try). 

 Note that after changing this variable, there is no need to restart Windows, but only new instances of cmd.exe will have the updated PATH. You can type set PATH at the command prompt to see what the current value is. 
 #1 Assuming you have Python2.7 installed 

 
 Goto the Start Menu 
 Right Click "Computer" 
 Select "Properties" 
 A dialog should pop up with a link on the left called "Advanced system settings". Click it. 
 In the System Properties dialog, click the button called "Environment Variables". 
 In the Environment Variables dialog look for "Path" under the System Variables window. 
 Add ";C:\Python27" to the end of it. The semicolon is the path separator on windows. 
 Click Ok and close the dialogs. 
 Now open up a new command prompt and type "python" 
 

 It should work. 
 #2 You don't add any variables to the System Variables. You take the existing 'Path' system variable, and modify it by adding a semi-colon after, then c:\Python27 
 #3 You have to put the python path in the PATH variable. 

 In the System Variables section, you should have User Variables and System Variables. Search for the PATH variable and edit its value, adding at the end ;C:\python27 . 

 The ; is to tell the variable to add a new path to this value, and the rest, is just to tell which path that is. 

 On the other hand, you can use ;%python% to add the variable you created. 
 #4 Modify the PATH variable too and append ;%python% otherwise the executable can not be found. 
 #5 You need to edit the environment variable named PATH , and add ;c:\python27 to the end of that. The semicolon separates one pathname from another (you will already have several things in your PATH ). 

 Alternately, you can just type 

 c:\python27\python
 

 at the command prompt without having to modify any environment variables at all. 
 #6 On Windows you use C:\Python27\python.exe instead of python . 

 If you add C:\Python27 to your path, you can shorten it to just python.exe , but you do not need to do this. 
 #7 First install the Python into your windows by using this url 
and then add path variable as 

 c:\python27
