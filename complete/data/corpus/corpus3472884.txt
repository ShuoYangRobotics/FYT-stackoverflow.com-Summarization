Question (ID-3472884): How to parse data in a variable length delimited file? I have a text file which does not confirm to standards. So I know the (end,start) positions of each column value. 

 Sample text file : 

 #  # # #
Techy Inn Val NJ
 

 Found the position of # using this code : 

 1 f = open('sample.txt', 'r')
 2 i = 0
 3 positions = []
 4 for line in f:
 5  if line.find('#') &gt; 0:
 6   print line
 7   for each in line:
 8    i += 1
 9    if each == '#':
 10     positions.append(i)
 

 1  7 11 15 => Positions 

 So far, so good! Now, how do I fetch the values from each row based on the positions I fetched? I am trying to construct an efficient loop but any pointers are greatly appreciated guys! Thanks (: 
 Answers (Total-8): #0 Here's a way to read fixed width fields using regexp 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; import re
&gt;&gt;&gt; s="Techy Inn Val NJ"
&gt;&gt;&gt; var1,var2,var3,var4 = re.match("(.{5}) (.{3}) (.{3}) (.{2})",s).groups()
&gt;&gt;&gt; var1
'Techy'
&gt;&gt;&gt; var2
'Inn'
&gt;&gt;&gt; var3
'Val'
&gt;&gt;&gt; var4
'NJ'
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
 
 #1 Off the top of my head: 

 f = open(.......)
header = f.next() # get first line
posns = [i for i, c in enumerate(header + "#") if c = '#']
for line in f:
 fields = [line[posns[k]:posns[k+1]] for k in xrange(len(posns) - 1)]
 

 Update with tested, fixed code: 

 import sys
f = open(sys.argv[1])
header = f.next() # get first line
print repr(header)
posns = [i for i, c in enumerate(header) if c == '#'] + [-1]
print posns
for line in f:
 posns[-1] = len(line)
 fields = [line[posns[k]:posns[k+1]].rstrip() for k in xrange(len(posns) - 1)]
 print fields
 

 Input file: 

 #  # #
Foo BarBaz
123456789abcd
 

 Debug output: 

 '#  # #\n'
[0, 7, 10, -1]
['Foo', 'Bar', 'Baz']
['1234567', '89a', 'bcd']
 

 Robustification notes: 

 
 This solution caters for any old rubbish (or nothing) after the last # in the header line; it doesn't need the header line to be padded out with spaces or anything else. 
 The OP needs to consider whether it's an error if the first character of the header is not # . 
 Each field has trailing whitespace stripped; this automatically removes a trailing newline from the rihtmost field (and doesn't run amok if the last line is not terminated by a newline). 
 

 Final(?) update: Leapfrooging @gnibbler's suggestion to use slice() : set up the slices once before looping. 

 import sys
f = open(sys.argv[1])
header = f.next() # get first line
print repr(header)
posns = [i for i, c in enumerate(header) if c == '#']
print posns
slices = [slice(lo, hi) for lo, hi in zip(posns, posns[1:] + [None])]
print slices
for line in f:
 fields = [line[sl].rstrip() for sl in slices]
 print fields
 
 #2 Adapted from John Machin's answer 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; header = "#  # # #"
&gt;&gt;&gt; row = "Techy Inn Val NJ"
&gt;&gt;&gt; posns = [i for i, c in enumerate(header) if c == '#']
&gt;&gt;&gt; [row[slice(*x)] for x in zip(posns, posns[1:]+[None])]
['Techy ', 'Inn ', 'Val ', 'NJ']
 

 You can also write the last line like this 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; [row[i:j] for i,j in zip(posns, posns[1:]+[None])]
 

 For the other example you give in the comments, you just need to have the correct header 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; header = "#  #  #  #"
&gt;&gt;&gt; row = "Techiyi Iniin Viial NiiJ"
&gt;&gt;&gt; posns = [i for i, c in enumerate(header) if c == '#']
&gt;&gt;&gt; [row[slice(*x)] for x in zip(posns, posns[1:]+[None])]
['Techiyi ', 'Iniin ', 'Viial ', 'NiiJ']
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
 
 #3 Ok, to be little different and to give the asked in comments generalized solution, I use the header line instead of slice and generator function. Additionally I have allowed first columns to be comment by not putting field name in first column and using of multichar field names instead of only '#'. 

 Minus point is that one char fields are not possible to have header names but only have '#' in header line (which are allways considered like in previous solutions as beginning of field, even after letters in header) 

 sample="""
   HOTEL  CAT ST DEP ##
Test line Techy Inn Val NJ FT FT
"""
data=sample.splitlines()[1:]

def fields(header,line):
 previndex=0
 prevchar=''
 for index,char in enumerate(header):
  if char == '#' or (prevchar != char and prevchar == ' '):
   if previndex or header[0] != ' ':
    yield line[previndex:index]
   previndex=index
  prevchar = char
 yield line[previndex:]

header,dataline = data
print list(fields(header,dataline))
 

 Output 

 ['Techy Inn ', 'Val ', 'NJ ', 'FT ', 'F', 'T']
 

 One practical use of this is to use in parsing fixed field length data without knowing the lengths by just putting copy of dataline with all fields and no comment present and spaces replaced with something else like '_' and single character field values replaced by #. 

 Header from sample line: 

 '   Techy_Inn Val NJ FT ##'
 
 #4 def parse(your_file):
 first_line = your_file.next().rstrip()
 slices = []
 start = None
 for e, c in enumerate(first_line):
  if c != '#':
   continue

  if start is None:
   start = e
   continue
  slices.append(slice(start, e))
  start = e
 if start is not None:
  slices.append(slice(start, None))

 for line in your_file:
  parsed = [line[s] for s in slices]
  yield parsed
 
 #5 f = open('sample.txt', 'r')
pos = [m.span() for m in re.finditer('#\s*', f.next())]
pos[-1] = (pos[-1][0], None)
for line in f:
 print [line[i:j].strip() for i, j in pos]
f.close()
 
 #6 This works well if the delimiter line indicates the fixed width fields. 

 delim = '#  # # # '

#parse delimiter line
slices = (slice(*m.span()) for m in re.finditer(r'# *', delim))

line = 'Techy Inn Val NJ'

#read fields
fields = [line[s] for s in slices]
 
 #7 How about this? 

 with open('somefile','r') as source:
 line= source.next()
 sizes= map( len, line.split("#") )[1:]
 positions = [ (sum(sizes[:x]),sum(sizes[:x+1])) for x in xrange(len(sizes)) ] 
 for line in source:
  fields = [ line[start,end] for start,end in positions ]
 

 Is this what you're looking for?
