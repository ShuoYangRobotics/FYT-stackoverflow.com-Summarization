Question (ID-6819653): Plotting points in python I want to plot some (x,y) points on the same graph and I don't need any special features at all short of support for polar coordinates which would be nice but not necessary. It's mostly for visualizing my data. Is there a simple way to do this? Matplotlib seems like way more than I need right now. Are there any more basic modules available? What do You recommend? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Go with matplotlib Chance is that sometime in the future you might need to do more than just "simple" stuff and then you don't need to invest time learning a new plot-tool. 

 See this link for list of plotting tools for python... 
 #1 Absolutely. Matplotlib is the way to go. 

 The pyplot module provides a nice interface to get simple plots up and running fast, especially if you are familiar with MatLab's plotting environment. Here is a simple example using pyplot: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
&gt;&gt;&gt; fig = plt.figure()
&gt;&gt;&gt; ax = fig.add_subplot(111)
&gt;&gt;&gt; x_points = xrange(0,9)
&gt;&gt;&gt; y_points = xrange(0,9)
&gt;&gt;&gt; p = ax.plot(x_points, y_points, 'b')
&gt;&gt;&gt; ax.set_xlabel('x-points')
&gt;&gt;&gt; ax.set_ylabel('y-points')
&gt;&gt;&gt; ax.set_title('Simple XY point plot')
&gt;&gt;&gt; fig.show()
 
 #2 You can use the Tkinter canvas widget . It uses rectangular coordinates but of course you can translate to polar. The canvas is pretty much just like it sounds -- a blank canvas on which you can draw points, lines, circles, rectangles, etc. 
 #3 You could always write a plotting function that uses the turtle module from the standard library. 
 #4 I suggest the most good looking plotting library for Python: CairoPlot 
 #5 MathGL is GPL plotting library which have Python interface, arbitrary (including polar) curved coordinates, a lot of plot types, export to PNG, EPS, SVG, widgets, and so on. For 1D plot samples see here .
