Question (ID-1956249): Python - Idiom to check if string is empty, print default I'm just wondering, is there a Python idiom to check if a string is empty, and then print a default if it's is? 

 (The context is Django, for the __unicode__(self) function for UserProfile - basically, I want to print the first name and last name, if it exists, and then the username if they don't both exist). 

 Cheers,
Victor 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 displayname = firstname+' '+lastname if firstname and lastname else username
 
 #1 displayname = firstname + lastname or username
 

 will work if firstname and last name has 0 length blank string 
 #2 Ok, I'm assuming you meant __unicode__() method. Try something like this (not tested, but real close to being correct): 

 from django.utils.encoding import smart_unicode
def __unicode__(self):
 u = self.user
 if u.firstname and u.lastname:
  return u"%s %s" % (u.firstname, u.lastname)
 return smart_unicode(u.username)
 

 I just realized you asked for the Python idiom, not the Django code. Oh well. 
 #3 I think this issue is better handled in the templates with something like: 

 {{ user.get_full_name|default:user.username }} 

 That uses Django's included "default" filter. There is also a "default_if_none" filter if you are specifically concerned about a None value, but want to allow a blank value (i.e. ''). The "default" filter will trigger on both a None value and a '' value. 

 Here's the link to the Django docs on it:
 http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/templates/builtins/#default 
 #4 Something like: 

 name = data.Name or "Default Name"
 
 #5 My schema would have None as an unset first- or lastname, so Frederico's answer wouldn't work. So: 

 print ("%s %s" % (firstname, lastname)
  if not (firstname and lastname) 
  else username )
