Question (ID-2940858): Kill process by name in python I'm trying to kill a process (specifically iChat) using python. I know how to use the command: 

 ps -A | grep iChat 
 

 Then: 

 kill -9 PID
 

 However, I'm not exactly sure how to translate these commands over to python. My guess is that it's not very difficult but I just don't know. Any help would be greatly appreciated! 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 If you have killall: 

 os.system("killall -9 iChat");
 

 Or: 

 os.system("ps -C iChat -o pid=|xargs kill -9")
 
 #1 Assuming you're on a Unix-like platform (so that ps -A exists), 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; import subprocess, signal
&gt;&gt;&gt; p = subprocess.Popen(['ps', '-A'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
&gt;&gt;&gt; out, err = p.communicate()
 

 gives you ps -A 's output in the out variable (a string). You can break it down into lines and loop on them...: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; for line in out.splitlines():
... if 'iChat' in line:
...  pid = int(line.split(None, 1)[0])
...  os.kill(pid, signal.SIGKILL)
... 
 

 (you could avoid importing signal , and use 9 instead of signal.SIGKILL , but I just don't particularly like that style, so I'd rather used the named constant this way). 

 Of course you could do much more sophisticated processing on these lines, but this mimics what you're doing in shell. 

 If what you're after is avoiding ps , that's hard to do across different Unix-like systems ( ps is their common API to get a process list, in a sense). But if you have a specific Unix-like system in mind, only (not requiring any cross-platform portability), it may be possible; in particular, on Linux, the /proc pseudo-filesystem is very helpful. But you'll need to clarify your exact requirements before we can help on this latter part. 
 #2 By using psutil ( http://code.google.com/p/psutil/ ): 

 import psutil

PROCNAME = "python.exe"

for proc in psutil.process_iter():
 if proc.name == PROCNAME:
  proc.kill()
 
 #3 you can those exact commands from python like this 

 import os 
print os.system('kill -9 ' + pid)
 

 But your command on getting the pid needs a bit of work though (can't just assume just because it has iChat that it really is iChat) you should use killall instead as suggested by Matthew Flaschen 
 #4 You can use pkill &lt;process_name&gt; in a unix system to kill process by name. 

 Then the python code will be: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; import os
&gt;&gt;&gt; process_name=iChat
&gt;&gt;&gt; os.system('pkill '+process_name)
 
 #5 you can use WMI module to do this on windows, though it's a lot clunkier than you unix folks are used to; import WMI takes a long time and there's intermediate pain to get at the process. 
 #6 The below code will kill all iChat oriented programs: 

 p = subprocess.Popen(['pgrep', '-l' , 'iChat'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
out, err = p.communicate()

for line in out.splitlines():  
 line = bytes.decode(line)
 pid = int(line.split(None, 1)[0])
 os.kill(pid, signal.SIGKILL)
