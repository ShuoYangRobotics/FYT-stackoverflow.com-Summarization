Question (ID-1540214): Can Python be used for client side web development? If yes are there any frameworks/Tutorials/tips/etc recommended? 

 N00b at Python but I have tons of PHP experience and wanted to expand my skill set. 

 I know Python is great at server side execution, just wanted to know about client side as well.

 #1 You can use pyjamas to convert Python code to JS code that runs in the browser (note that pyjamas also offers much more). So YES, you can use Python for client side web development. 

 Pyjamas is basically a port of the Google Web Toolkit , which allows you to write client side code in Java. 
 #2 Python isn't really used for client side, because no major web browsers have Python built in. 

 However, Javascript has become more and more Python-like as it has evolved. You might want to study Python and Javascript together. 

 Take a look at https://developer.mozilla.org/en/New_in_JavaScript_1.7 and notice the Python-like nature of the new features. "array comprehensions" are just like Python list comprehensions; iterators and generators are straight out of Python; "destructuring assignments" are a standard Python idiom. 

 Javascript is kind of like Python with curly braces. It uses a very different inheritance model, but libraries are available that implement a more Python-like class system on top of the built-in system in Javascript. 
 #3 Silverlight can run IronPython, so you can make Silverlight applications. Which is client-side. 
 #4 Have a look at this: 

 http://www.trypython.org/ 

 It's an interactive python console + tutorial written with Silverlight+IronPython. 
 #5 Noone has mentioned it yet, but grail is/was pretty cool
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grail%5F%28web%5Fbrowser ) 

 "Grail was a free extensible multi-platform web browser written in the Python programming language. The project was started in August 1995, with its first public release in November of that year. [1] The .3 beta contained over 27,000 lines of Python.[1] Its last release was of version 0.6 in 1999, with latest version under development." 
 #6 Python is available for the client: skulpt 

 If its client side your interested may be worth checking out

 #7 On Windows, any language that registers for the Windows Scripting Host can run in IE. At least the ActiveState version of Python could do that; I seem to recall that has been superseded by a more official version these days. 

 But that solution requires the user to install a python interpreter and run some script or .reg file to put the correct "magic" into the registry for the hooks to work. 
 #8 No. Browsers don't run Python.
