Question (ID-8641008): Compare multiple variables to the same value in "if" in Python? I am using Python and I would like to have an if statement with many variables in it. 

 such as: 

 if A, B, C, and D &gt;= 2:
   print (A, B, C, and D)
 

 I realize that this is not the correct syntax and that is exactly the question I am asking - what is the correct Python syntax for this type of an if statement? Thank you! 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 What about this: 

 if all(x &gt;= 2 for x in (A, B, C, D)):
 print A, B, C, D
 

 This should be helpful if you're testing a long list of variables with the same condition. 
 #1 Another idea: 

 if min(A, B, C, D) &gt;= 2:
 print A, B, C, D
 
 #2 I'd probably write this as 

 v = A, B, C, D
if all(i &gt;= 2 for i in v):
 print v
 
 #3 If you have ten variables that you are treating as a group like this, you probably want to make them elements of a list, or values in a dictionary, or attributes of an object. For example: 

 my_dict = {'A': 1, 'B': 2, 'C': 3 }

if all(x &gt; 2 for x in my_dict.values()):
 print "They're all more than two!"
 
 #4 How about: 

 if A &gt;= 2 and B &gt;= 2 and C &gt;= 2 and D &gt;= 2:
 print A, B, C, D
 

 For the general case, there isn't a shorter way for indicating that the same condition must be true for all variables - unless you're willing to put the variables in a list, for that take a look at some of the other answers. 
 #5 Except that he's probably asking for this: 

 if A &gt;= 2 and B &gt;= 2 and C &gt;= 2 and D &gt;= 2:
 
 #6 Depending on what you are trying to accomplish, passing a list to a function may work. 

 def foo(lst):
 for i in lst:
  if i &lt; 2:
   return
 print lst
