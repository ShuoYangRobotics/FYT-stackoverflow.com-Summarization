Question (ID-1407837): Is there an Rake equivalent in Python? Rake is a software build tool written in Ruby (like ant or make), and so all its files are written in this language. Does something like this exist in Python? 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 Paver has a similar set of goals, though I don't really know how it compares. 
 #1 scons 
 #2 Waf is a Python-based framework for configuring, compiling and installing applications. It derives from the concepts of other build tools such as Scons, Autotools, CMake or Ant. 
 #3 I would check out distutils : 

 
 The distutils package provides support
 for building and installing additional
 modules into a Python installation.
 The new modules may be either
 100%-pure Python, or may be extension
 modules written in C, or may be
 collections of Python packages which
 include modules coded in both Python
 and C. 
 
 #4 Also check out buildout, which isn't so much a make system for software, as a make system for a deployment. 

 http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pysqlite/2.5.5 

 So it's not a direct rake equivalent, but may be a better match for what you want to do, or a really lousy one. 
 #5 There is Phantom in Boo (which isn't python but nearly). 
 #6 Although it is more commonly used for deployment, Fabric might be interesting for this use case.
