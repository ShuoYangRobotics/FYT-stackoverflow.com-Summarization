Question (ID-3489038): Looking for beginner Python project ideas to learn the language I've read through "Python for Dummies" and I'm ready to take the next step. I hear that practicing coding with the goal of creating something is the best way to learn. I'm a beginner in Python, and I'm looking for project ideas that I should attempt. 

 I'm looking to learn web app programming, so any project that would teach me this area would be greatly appreciated. 

 I'd also like to send my code to anyone who proposes a project for me so I could get feedback.

 #1 Help out Twisted! 
 #2 try http://projecteuler.net/ It is a little math heavy, but not too bad. 

 Also try something that requires reading from and writing to files. Something that requires parsing, and something that requires network behavior, like pulling a web page. 
 #3 Look at django the web framework for python and develop little web applications. This is what ive done, and im learning python as it looked cool from just using it. 
 #4 I learned Python web development with TurboGears (which now seems to have left all of its momentum in favour of Django ) creating an ebook management app. It was a great exercise and I will surely recommend it. 
 #5 If your looking for something small I find doing classic CS problems a good learning tool. For example you could implement a Primes iterator using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
