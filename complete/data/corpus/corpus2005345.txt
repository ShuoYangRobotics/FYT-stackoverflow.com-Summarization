Question (ID-2005345): String manipulation in Python I am trying to write a command but I do not want one long line that looks untidy. I am looking to add the strings together to be executed as on command. I have some code below which is part of an email function: 

 msg = MIMEText("The nightly build status was a SUCCESS\n\nBuild File: http://www.python.org\n\n Build Results File: http://10.51.54.57/sandboxes/", project, "\n")
 

 This shows the one line, I am hoping for a better way to do this. I have tried the below code but it does not work. 

 msg = MIMEText("The nightly build status was a SUCCESS\n\nBuild File: ")
msg += MIMEText("http://www.python.org\n\n Build Results File: ")
msg += MIMEText("http://10.51.54.57/sandboxes/", project, "\n")
 

 Thanks for any help. 

 I have tried the below code but get: 

 msg = MIMEText("""The nightly build status was a SUCCESS\n\n
 Build File: """, 
 build_file, """
 \n\n 
 Build Results File: """, 
 build_file, """
 \n\n
 Sandbox Folder:""", 
 sandbox, """ 
 \n\n
 Antibrick File: """,
 antibrick, "\n\n")
 

 Now I get the message: 

 Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "test_email.py", line 45, in &lt;module&gt;
 if __name__ == '__main__': myObject = email_success()
 File "test_email.py", line 32, in email_success
 antibrick, "\n\n")
TypeError: __init__() takes at most 4 arguments (10 given)
 

 Any ideas? 

 Thanks S.Mark, I tried this but when the email is sent it is not as a hyperlink but sent as: 

 The nightly build status was a SUCCESS


Build File: ('http://10.67.54.57/sandboxes/', '2010-01-05/new_sandbox', 'basebuild') 



Build Results File: ('http://10.67.54.57/sandboxes/', '2010-01-05/new_sandbox', 'basebuild') 



Sandbox Folder: ('http://10.67.54.57/sandboxes/', '2010-01-05/new_sandbox') 



Antibrick File: 
 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Try: 

 msg = MIMEText("""The nightly build status was a SUCCESS

Build File:
http://www.python.org

Build Results File: 
http://10.51.54.57/sandboxes/""", project, "\n")
 

 If the additional space at the beginning of each line is a problem, remove them with a regexp ( r'^\s+' ) 
 #1 How about 

 msg = MIMEText(
"The nightly build status was a SUCCESS\n\n"
"Build File: http://www.python.org\n\n"
"Build Results File: http://10.51.54.57/sandboxes/"
, project
, "\n"
)
 

 Or 

 msg = MIMEText("""The nightly build status was a SUCCESS

Build File: http://www.python.org

Build Results File: http://10.51.54.57/sandboxes/""", project, "\n")
 

 Or 

 msg = MIMEText("The nightly build status was a SUCCESS\n\n"
"Build File: http://www.python.org\n\n"
"Build Results File: http://10.51.54.57/sandboxes/"
, project, "\n")
 

 UPDATE : because OP added another question 

 msg=MIMEText("""The nightly build status was a SUCCESS\n\n
 Build File: %s
 \n\n 
 Build Results File: %s
 \n\n
 Sandbox Folder: %s 
 \n\n
 Antibrick File: """ % (build_file,build_file,sandbox),
 antibrick, 
 "\n\n"
)
 
 #2 Why not 

 msg= MIMEText("The nightly build status was a SUCCESS\n\nBuild File: "+ \
 "http://www.python.org\n\n Bu..... ") 
 

 etc. 

 (I.e., use the line continuation backslash). 

 Also note that the following each give you abcdef 

 s ="abc" "def"

s= "abc" \
  "def"
 

 Also, 

 s="""xyz
 wvu"""
 

 gives you 

 'xyz\nwvu'
 
 #3 Python supports multi-line strings using triple quotes: 

 text = """The nightly build status was a SUCCESS\n\nBuild File: 
http://www.python.org\n\n Build Results File: 
http://10.51.54.57/sandboxes/"""
msg = MIMEText(text, project, "\n")
 
 #4 you can use triple quotes 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; s="""The nightly build status was a SUCCESS

Build File: http://www.python.org

Build Results File: http://10.51.54.57/sandboxes/"""

&gt;&gt;&gt; msg=MimeType(s,project,"\n")
 
 #5 Hmm, what exactly is the module are you using? I am guessing, that it is deprecated, because the modern interface is email (if I've guessed your intentions correctly). More specifically, to create a MIMEText object you use this class . The signature is 

 email.mime.text.MIMEText(_text[, _subtype[, _charset]])
