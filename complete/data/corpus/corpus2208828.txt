Question (ID-2208828): Detect 64bit OS (windows) in Python Does anyone know how I would go about detected what bit version Windows is under Python. I need to know this as a way of using the right folder for Program Files. 

 Many thanks 
 Answers (Total-10): #0 I guess you should look in os.environ['PROGRAMFILES'] for the program files folder. 
 #1  platform module -- Access to underlying platformâ€™s identifying data 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; import platform
&gt;&gt;&gt; platform.architecture()
('32bit', 'WindowsPE')
 

 Can anyone running 64-bit Windows tell us what 32-bit python running on 64-bit Windows returns? 
 #2 Came here searching for properly detecting if running on 64bit windows, compiling all the above into something more concise. 

 Below you will find a function to test if running on 64bit windows, a function to get the 32bit Program Files folder, and a function to get the 64bit Program Files folder; all regardless of running 32bit or 64bit python. When running 32bit python, most things report as if 32bit when running on 64bit, even os.environ['PROGRAMFILES'] . 

 import os

def Is64Windows():
 return 'PROGRAMFILES(X86)' in os.environ

def GetProgramFiles32():
 if Is64Windows():
  return os.environ['PROGRAMFILES(X86)']
 else:
  return os.environ['PROGRAMFILES']

def GetProgramFiles64():
 if Is64Windows():
  return os.environ['PROGRAMW6432']
 else:
  return None
 

 Note : Yes, this is a bit hackish. All other methods that "should just work", do not work when running 32bit Python on 64bit Windows (at least for the various 2.x and 3.x versions I have tried).

 #3 You should be using environment variables to access this. The program files directory is stored in the environment variable PROGRAMFILES on x86 Windows, the 32-bit program files is directory is stored in the PROGRAMFILES(X86) environment variable, these can be accessed by using os.environ('PROGRAMFILES') . 

 Use sys.getwindowsversion() or the existence of PROGRAMFILES(X86) ( if 'PROGRAMFILES(X86)' in os.environ ) to determine what version of Windows you are using. 
 #4 The subject lines asks about detecting 64 or 32bit OS, while the body talks about determining the location of ProgramFiles. The latter has a couple of workable answers here. I'd like to add another solution generalized to handle StartMenu, Desktop, etc. as well as ProgramFiles: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2216173/how-to-get-path-of-start-menus-programs-directory 
 #5 Many of these proposed solutions, such as platform.architecture(), fail because their results depend on whether you are running 32-bit or 64-bit Python. 

 The only reliable method I have found is to check for the existence of os.environ['PROGRAMFILES(X86)'], which is unfortunately hackish. 
 #6 def os_platform():
 true_platform = os.environ['PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE']
 try:
   true_platform = os.environ["PROCESSOR_ARCHITEW6432"]
 except KeyError:
   pass
   #true_platform not assigned to if this does not exist
 return true_platform

 #7 64-bit versions of Windows use something called registry redirection and reflection keys. There is a compatibility layer called WoW64 which enables compatibility of 32-bit applications. Starting from Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 WoW64 registry keys are not longer reflected but shared. You can read about it here: 

 registry-reflection: msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa384235(v=vs.85).aspx 

 affected-keys: msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa384253(v=vs.85).aspx 

 wikipedia: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WoW64 

 All you need to do is detect existence of those keys. You can use _winreg for that. Use try: and try opening key, example: 

 try:
aReg = _winreg.OpenKey(_winreg.HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE,"SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run")
 
 #8 &gt;&gt;&gt; 2**63-1 == sys.maxint
True
 

 For 64 bit, and 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; 2**31-1 == sys.maxint
True
 

 For 32 bit. 
 #9 There should be a directory under Windows 64bit, a Folder called \Windows\WinSxS64 for 64 bit, under Windows 32bit, it's WinSxS. 

 Hope this helps,
Best regards,
Tom.
