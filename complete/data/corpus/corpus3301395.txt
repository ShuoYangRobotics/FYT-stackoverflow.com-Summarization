Question (ID-3301395): Check if space is in a string http://paste.pocoo.org/show/240061/ 
I'm writing a program that checks whether the string is a single word. Why doesn't this work and is there any better way to check if a string has no spaces/is a single word.. 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 == takes precedence over in , so you're actually testing word == True . 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; w = 'ab c'
&gt;&gt;&gt; ' ' in w == True
1: False
&gt;&gt;&gt; (' ' in w) == True
2: True
 

 But you don't need == True at all. if requires [something that evalutes to True or False] and ' ' in word will evalute to true or false. So, if ' ' in word: ... is just fine. 
 #1 Write if " " in word: instead of if " " in word == True: . 

 Explanation: 

 
 In Python, for example a &lt; b &lt; c is equivalent to (a &lt; b) and (b &lt; c) . 
 The same holds for any chain of comparison operators, which include in ! 
 Therefore ' ' in w == True is equivalent to (' ' in w) and (w == True) which is not what you want. 
 
 #2 word = ' '
while True:
 if ' ' in word:
  word = raw_input("Please enter a single word: ")
 else:
  print "Thanks"
  break
 

 This is more idiomatic python - comparison against True or False is not necessary - just use the value returned by the expression ' ' in word . 

 Also, you don't need to use pastebin for such a small snippet of code - just copy the code into your post and use the little 1s and 0s button to make your code look like code. 
 #3 You can say word.strip(" ") to remove any leading/trailing spaces from the string - you should do that before your if statement. That way if someone enters input such as " test " your program will still work. 

 That said, if " " in word: will determine if a string contains any spaces. If that does not working, can you please provide more information? 
 #4 There are a lot of ways to do that : 

 t = s.split(" ")
if len(t) &gt; 1:
 print "several tokens"
 

 To be sure it matches every kind of space, you can use re module : 

 import re
m = re.match("\s", your_string, re.M)
if m:
 print "several words"
 
 #5 Use this: 

 word = raw_input("Please enter a single word : ")
while True:
 if " " in word:
  word = raw_input("Please enter a single word : ")
 else:
  print "Thanks"
  break
 
 #6 You can try this, and if it will find any space it will return the position where the first space is. 

 if mystring.find(' ') != -1:
 print True
else:
 print False
