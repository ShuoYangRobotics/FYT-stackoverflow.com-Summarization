Question (ID-5460011): Web application admin generators Since Symfony 1.x's admin generator , I found this kind of tool really useful to prototype applications, show something very quickly to customers etc. 

 Now for Symfony2 , admin generator does not seems to be a priority (see here and here ) 

 Django 's admin generator seems very interesting... 

 Which web application admin generator (any language / technology) would you recommend (pros / cons) ? 

 Thanks. 
 Answers (Total-9): #0 Django's automatic admin app is excellent. Once you've written your models, it automatically creates a full-featured admin app around them where you can create, update and delete records. It's also extensible and customizable for just about whatever you need. 

 Here's a pretty good overview about it . Django (and python) is intuitive and satisfying to work with -- I highly recommend that you set it up and play with it and see how well it works. 
 #1 Agile Toolkit is a Web UI framework. It's not generating anything, but you can easily build any UI, admin or front-end. Here is a sample code: 

 &lt;?php
class page_admin extends Page {
 function init(){
  parent::init();

  $t=$this-&gt;add('Tabs');
  $t-&gt;addTab('Users')-&gt;add('CRUD')-&gt;setModel('User');
  $t-&gt;addTab('Articles')-&gt;add('CRUD')-&gt;setModel('Articles');

 }
}
 

 You would also need to define models, but it's quite simple. Take a look at the introduction:

 #2 Personally, I have found Yii's scaffolding is the best there is. Quick First Application 

 What I truly loved: 

 
 Controlled creation of files. Yii provides an interface to create all required files, called Gii. 
 You have the ability to generate your model classes based on the database model. 
 You have the ability to generate CRUD operations for all your model classes (Action methods for your controller class). 
 

 The generated scaffolding includes: Pagination, Searching, Advanced Searching, Listening, Inserting and Updating includes validation out of the box, Deleting. And all of the interface is ajax driven. 
 #3 For Ruby on Rails: Here is some discussion on SO 

 But ActiveScaffold's home page at the moment is still talking about Rails 2.3, so you may want to read past the accepted answer and check the others to see if there are newer ones. 

 Rails Admin looks to be actively developed and has good pedigree (having been a Google Summer of Code project mentored by big names in the Rails community, so I'd start there if I were looking. 
 #4 something a lot more powerful for CakePHP is https://github.com/josegonzalez/cake_admin , little bit of a Django rip-off :) 
 #5 I like sprox , for Python. Although I have not found it particularly useful for production, it can help a lot in terms of prototyping and testing -- its simplicity is its strength here, enhancing Python's own strengths. 
 #6 Padrino has "Padrino Admin":

 While not as popular as Rails, it's built around the excellent Sinatra DSL. 
 #7 I can recommend CakePHP scaffolding , where you can also add admin routing . Nice for you is that you can stay on PHP, which you also used for Symphony. Be warned, you might get addicted to Cake ;) 
 #8 For Rails applications, Rails Admin with CanCan is the best solution as of now. These are very actively maintained and supports Rails 3.0. With CanCan, you can customize access on models. So that you can easily set multiple level of admins/authors. Previously I have used ActiveScaffold for 2.0 application but it doesn't seem to support newest Rails.
