Question (ID-530114): Print method question Python In python, what does the 2nd % signifies? 

 print "%s" % ( i )
 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 As others have said, this is the Python string formatting/interpolation operator. It's basically the equivalent of sprintf in C, for example: 

 a = "%d bottles of %s on the wall" % (10, "beer") 

 is equivalent to something like 

 a = sprintf("%d bottles of %s on the wall", 10, "beer"); 

 in C. Each of these has the result of a being set to "10 bottles of beer on the wall" 

 Note however that this syntax is deprecated in Python 3.0; its replacement looks something like 

 a = "{0} bottles of {1} on the wall".format(10, "beer") 

 This works because any string literal is automatically turned into a str object by Python. 
 #1 The second % is the string interpolation operator. 

 Link to documentation . 
 #2 It's a format specifier 

 Simple usage: 

 # Prints: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
for i in range(10):
 print "%d" % i,
 
 #3 print "%d%s" % (100, "trillion dollars") # outputs: 100 trillion dollars
 
 #4 If you were to translate the code to English, it says: take the string i and format it in to the predicate string. 

 Another example: 

 name = "world"
print "hello, %s" % (name)
