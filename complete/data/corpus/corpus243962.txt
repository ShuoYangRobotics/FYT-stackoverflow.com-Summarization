Question (ID-243962): Which Eclipse package to download for pydev? I'm getting started with python, eclipse and pydev. Which Eclipse package should I choose? Nothing on the eclipse homepage tells me what to choose and python documentation assumes I have eclipse installed. Does which package I choose matter? 
 Answers (Total-9): #0 If you just plan on doing Python dev, I'd just go with Classic Eclipse. 

 After that, I'd follow the instructions http://pydev.org/download.html and http://pydev.org/manual_101_root.html to install PyDev. 

 I use the same setup for Python development. I also have the RadRails plugin for Ruby on Rails development. 
 #1 If you are getting started, I would recommend you python easyeclipse . 

 Pydev can give some incompatibilities when using it together with other extensions. 
 #2 PyDev was acquired by Aptana , so you might want to check that one out as well. 
 #3 A useful shortcut is to download EasyEclipse for PyDev . This is a version of Eclipse already pre-configured for pydev, and seems to be easier to install than gathering all of the Eclipse pieces yourself. Unfortunately it uses a rather old version of PyDev, but this is easily remedied by going to Help &gt; Software Updates &gt; and letting Eclipse grab the latest version (you'll need to change the PyDev location to SourceForge before doing this). 
 #4 Assuming Python, and nothing else - I would just get the "Runtime Binary" edition of Eclipse, and add the PyDev extension. That way Eclipse starts up lightning fast, consumes less memory and generally gets in your way less. On top of that, you can always add in whatever extensions/plugins you find you need. The runtime is generally around 50MB, instead of the usual 100+ for the SDK or other versions. 

 You can always find the latest version here: 

 http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/ 

 At the time of this posting, that would be 3.6.1: 

 http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/R-3.6.1-201009090800/index.php#PlatformRuntime 
 #5 I use J2EE Eclipse for Python and Java development. It works well.
But Classic Eclipse should be enought. 
 #6 pydev and Python2.6 doesnt work with eclipse for C++.
Download the classic version and you should be good. 
 #7 I think that the Aptana distribution of Eclipse the the easiest way to get PyDev these days...especially since it's now free for the full version. If you download the Studio from here: http://www.aptana.org/ You can easily install PyDev from their plugin manager once it's up and running. 
 #8 I'd recommend http://www.aptana.com/ if you're doing web development (as the editors for web-related contents, such as html, css, javascript are very good) or getting only the Platform Runtime Binary (which is the lightest released Eclipse with things needed for Pydev, around 47 MB -- it can be gotten at: http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/ , selecting the version you want and then looking for the Platform Runtime Binary). 

 The install instructions are at: http://pydev.org/manual_101_install.html (and from there a getting started manual follows).
