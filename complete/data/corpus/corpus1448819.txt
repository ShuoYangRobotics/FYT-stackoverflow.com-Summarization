Question (ID-1448819): How to install pysqlite? I am trying to install pysqlite (Python interface to the SQLite). I downloaded the file with the package (pysqlite-2.5.5.tar.gz). And I did the following: 

 gunzip pysqlite-2.5.5.tar.gz
tar xvf pysqlite-2.5.5.tar
\cd pysqlite-2.5.5
python setup.py install
 

 At the last step I have a problem. I get the following error message: 

 error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1
 

 I found that other peoples also had this problem . 

 As far as I understood in the person had a problem because sqlite2 was not installed. But in my case, I have sqlite3 (I can run it from command line). 

 May be I should change some paths in "setup.cfg" ? At the moment I have there: 

 #define=
#include_dirs=/usr/local/include
#library_dirs=/usr/local/lib
libraries=sqlite3
define=SQLITE_OMIT_LOAD_EXTENSION
 

 And if I type "which sqlite3" I get: 

 /usr/bin/sqlite3
 

 I saw a similar question here. The answer was "you need sqlite3-dev". But, even if it is the case, how to check if I have sqlite3-dev . And if I do not have it how to get it? 

 Can anybody pleas help me with that problem. 

 Thank you in advance. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 What version of Python do you have? SQLite is integrated in Python since 2.5: 

 http://docs.python.org/library/sqlite3.html 

 If you insist on compiling it yourself, the package is called sqlite3-devel, you can find it e.g. here 
 #1 
 how to check if I have "sqlite3-dev" 
 

 That's entirely dependent on what Linux distro you're using -- is it Fedora, Suse, Ubuntu, Gentoo, Mandrake, or which other one out of the dozens out there; there are several packaging strategies and tools used to check which packages are there, get more, and so forth. 

 So, never ask questions about checking, getting or tweaking packages on Linux without specifying the distribution[s] of interest -- it makes it essentially impossible to offer precise, specific help. 

 Edit : the simplest way I know of getting details about your Linux distribution (works on all the ones I have at hand to try, but I don't have a particularly wide array...;-): 

 $ cat /etc/*-release
DISTRIB_CODENAME=hardy
DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Ubuntu 8.04.2"
DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu
DISTRIB_RELEASE=8.04
...etc, etc...
 

 This is probably going to be the contents of file /etc/lsb-release , but I'm suggesting the *-release because I think there may be some other such files involved. 

 Of course, if the need to check your distro applies inside a file or program, reading this file (or files) and locating specific contents will also be quite feasible; but for the purpose of informing would-be helpers about what distro you're using, the cat at the shell prompt is going to be quite sufficient;-). 
 #2 I'm the one who answered the other question :) On systems that use RPM packages, i.e. you normally use 'yum' to install things, the package is named sqlite3-devel. 

 On most Debian based systems (i.e. you use apt-get to install packages), the package is named sqlite3-dev. 

 This is a very typical difference between the two, most other packages follow the same naming convention. 
 #3 I had the same trouble with gcc failing with Ubuntu Karmic. I fixed this by installing the python-dev package. In my case, I'm working with python2.4, so I installed the python2.4-dev package. The python-dev package should work for python2.6. 
 #4 I had the same problem, I'm using python 2.4, neither sqlite3-dev nor libsqlite3-dev are available for CentOS. 

 yum install python-devel
 

 seems to solve the issue. 
 #5 I had following compile errors on CentOS release 5.6 : 

 src/cache.h:34: error: expected specifier-qualifier-list before 'PyObject_HEAD'
src/cache.h:44: error: expected specifier-qualifier-list before 'PyObject_HEAD'

src/cache.h:67: error: expected declaration specifiers or '...' before 'PyObject'

 Installing python-devel helped me too: 

 yum install python-devel
