Question (ID-7569748): Python List Parsing Probably a simple question, but I am new to Python. I have a file containing email addresses, one per line. I want to read the file and append them together separated by a comma. Is there a more pythonic way of doing this? 

 def getEmailList(file_name):
 f = open(file_name, 'r')
 emailstr = ''
 for line in f:
  emailstr += line.rstrip() + ','
 f.close()
 return emailstr
 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 You could do the following: 

 def getEmailList(file_name):
 with open(file_name) as f:
  return ",".join(x.rstrip() for x in f)
 

 The key features of that version are: 

 
 Using the with statement so that the file is automatically closed when control leaves that block. 
 Using the list comprehension generator expression x.rstrip() for x in f to strip each line Thanks to agf for that correction 
 Using str.join to put a ',' between each item in the sequence 
 
 #1 ','.join(line.rstrip() for line in f)
 
 #2 def getEmailList(file_name):
 with open(file_name, 'r') as f:
  result = ", ".join(addr.rstrip() for addr in f)
 return result
 
 #3 def getEmaulList(file_name):
 with open(file_name, "r") as f:
  data = f.read()
  emails = ",".join(data.split("\n"))
  return emails
 

 Keeps it simple. 
 #4 How about: 

 with open(file_name, 'r') as f:
 emailstr = ','.join(line.rstrip() for line in f)
 
 #5 You can use the join method to join together a set of strings. 

 def getEmailList(file_name):
 with open(file_name, 'r') as f:
  return ','.join([line.rstrip() for line in f])
 
 #6 everything in one shot 

 ",".join([x.replace('\n','') for x in open("yourFile.txt").readlines()])
