Question (ID-2904847): What the heck kind of timestamp is this: 1267488000000 And how do I convert it to a datetime.datetime instance in python? 

 It's the output from the New York State Senate's API: http://open.nysenate.gov/legislation/ . 
 Answers (Total-9): #0 It looks like Unix time, but with milliseconds instead of seconds? 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; import time
&gt;&gt;&gt; time.gmtime(1267488000000 / 1000)
time.struct_time(tm_year=2010, tm_mon=3, tm_mday=2, tm_hour=0, tm_min=0, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=1, tm_yday=61, tm_isdst=0)
 

 March 2nd, 2010? 

 And if you want a datetime object: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; import datetime
&gt;&gt;&gt; datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(1267488000000 / 1000)
datetime.datetime(2010, 3, 1, 19, 0)
 

 Note that the datetime is using the local timezone while the time.struct_time is using UTC. 
 #1 Maybe milliseconds? 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; import time
&gt;&gt;&gt; time.gmtime(1267488000000/1000)
time.struct_time(tm_year=2010, tm_mon=3, tm_mday=2, \
 tm_hour=0, tm_min=0, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=1, tm_yday=61, tm_isdst=0)
 
 #2 Try this: 

 import datetime
datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(1267488000000/1000)
 
 #3 It's in miliseconds from epoch (but rounded to tousends of seconds). Try using: 

 datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(timestamp / 1000)
 
 #4 This is pretty informative. I think you have a time stamp in milliseconds since Thursday, January 1st, 1970. 
 #5 1267488000000 is a epoch timestamp with milliseconds . It is "Tue Mar 02 2010 08:00:00 GMT+0800 (WST)" (where I live, at least) 
 #6 Note that the Javascript Date object and the Java Date class both use milliseconds since Jan 1 1970 GMT. Both languages are commonly used in web services. 
 #7 This is almost certainly a timestamp (the number of milliseconds since the epoch). You want date.fromtimestamp(timestamp) to make sense of it. 
 #8 This is probably a Unix timestamp. See here for some time conversions in python.
