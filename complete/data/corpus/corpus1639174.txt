Question (ID-1639174): Creating class instance properties from a dictionary in Python I'm importing from a CSV and getting data roughly in the format 

 { 'Field1' : 3000, 'Field2' : 6000, 'RandomField' : 5000 }
 

 The names of the fields are dynamic. (Well, they're dynamic in that there might be more than Field1 and Field2, but I know Field1 and Field2 are always going to be there. 

 I'd like to be able to pass in this dictionary into my class allMyFields so that I can access the above data as properties. 

 class allMyFields:
 # I think I need to include these to allow hinting in Komodo. I think.
 self.Field1 = None
 self.Field2 = None

 def __init__(self,dictionary):
  for k,v in dictionary.items():
   self.k = v 
   #of course, this doesn't work. I've ended up doing this instead
   #self.data[k] = v
   #but it's not the way I want to access the data. 

q = { 'Field1' : 3000, 'Field2' : 6000, 'RandomField' : 5000 }
instance = allMyFields(q)
# Ideally I could do this.
print q.Field1
 

 Any suggestions? As far as why -- I'd like to be able to take advantage of code hinting, and importing the data into a dictionary called 'data' as I've been doing doesn't afford me any of that. 

 (Since the variable names aren't resolved till runtime, I'm still going to have to throw a bone to Komodo - I think the self.Field1 = None should be enough. 

 So - how do I do what I want? Or am I barking up a poorly designed, non-python tree? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 You can use setattr (be careful though: not every string is a valid attribute name!): 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; class AllMyFields:
...  def __init__(self, dictionary):
...   for k, v in dictionary.items():
...    setattr(self, k, v)
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; o = AllMyFields({'a': 1, 'b': 2})
&gt;&gt;&gt; o.a
1
 

 Edit: let me explain the difference between the above code and SilentGhost's answer . The above code snippet creates a class of which instance attributes are based on a given dictionary. SilentGhost's code creates a class whose class attributes are based on a given dictionary. 

 Depending on your specific situation either of these solutions may be more suitable. Do you plain to create one or more class instances? If the answer is one, you may as well skip object creation entirely and only construct the type (and thus go with SilentGhost's answer). 
 #1 &gt;&gt;&gt; q = { 'Field1' : 3000, 'Field2' : 6000, 'RandomField' : 5000 }
&gt;&gt;&gt; q = type('allMyFields', (object,), q)
&gt;&gt;&gt; q.Field1
3000
 

 docs for type explain well what's going here (see use as a constructor). 

 edit : in case you need instance variables, the following also works: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; a = q()    # first instance
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.Field1
3000
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.Field1 = 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.Field1
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; q().Field1   # second instance
3000
 
 #2 Using named tuples (Python 2.6): 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; from collections import namedtuple

&gt;&gt;&gt; the_dict = {'Field1': 3, 'Field2': 'b', 'foo': 4.9}
&gt;&gt;&gt; fields = ' '.join(the_dict.keys())
&gt;&gt;&gt; AllMyFields = namedtuple('AllMyFields', fields)
&gt;&gt;&gt; instance = AllMyFields(**the_dict)

&gt;&gt;&gt; print instance.Field1, instance.Field2, instance.foo
3 b 4.9
 
 #3 You can also use dict.update instead of manually looping over items (and if you're looping, iteritems is better). 

 class allMyFields(object):
 # note: you cannot (and don't have to) use self here
 Field1 = None
 Field2 = None

 def __init__(self, dictionary):
  self.__dict__.update(dictionary)

q = { 'Field1' : 3000, 'Field2' : 6000, 'RandomField' : 5000 }
instance = allMyFields(q)

print instance.Field1  # =&gt; 3000
print instance.Field2  # =&gt; 6000
print instance.RandomField # =&gt; 5000
 
 #4 Use setattr for the pretty way. The quick-n-dirty way is to update the instance internal dictionary: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; class A(object):
... pass
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = A()
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.__dict__.update({"foo": 1, "bar": 2})
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.foo
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.bar
2
&gt;&gt;&gt;
 
 #5 You could make a subclass of dict which allows attribute lookup for keys: 

 class AttributeDict(dict):
 def __getattr__(self, name):
  return self[name]

q = AttributeDict({ 'Field1' : 3000, 'Field2' : 6000, 'RandomField' : 5000 })
print q.Field1    
print q.Field2    
print q.RandomField
 

 If you try to look up an attribute that dict already has (say keys or get ), you'll get that dict class attribute (a method). If the key you ask for doesn't exist on the dict class, then the __getattr__ method will get called and will do your key lookup.
