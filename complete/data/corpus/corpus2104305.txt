Question (ID-2104305): Python: Elements not in a list So heres my code: 

 item = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

for item in z:
 if item not in z:
  print item
 

 Z contains a list of integers. I want to compare item to Z and print out the numbers that are not in Z when compared to item. I can print the elemtens that are in Z when compared not items, but when i try and do the opposite using the code above nothing prints. 

 Any help? 
 Answers (Total-8): #0 &gt;&gt; items = [1,2,3,4]
&gt;&gt; Z = [3,4,5,6]

&gt;&gt; print list(set(items)-set(Z))
[1, 2]
 
 #1 Your code is not doing what I think you think it is doing. The line for item in z: will iterate through z , each time making item equal to one single element of z . The original item list is therefore overwritten before you've done anything with it. 

 I think you want something like this: 

 item = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

for element in item:
 if element not in z:
  print element
 

 But you could easily do this like: 

 set(item) - set(z)
 
 #2 If you run a loop taking items from z, how do you expect them not to be in z? IMHO it would make more sense comparing items from a different list to z. 
 #3 list1 = [1,2,3,4]; list2 = [0,3,3,6]

print set(list2) - set(list1)
 
 #4 &gt;&gt;&gt; item = set([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9])
&gt;&gt;&gt; z = set([2,3,4])
&gt;&gt;&gt; print item - z
set([0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
 
 #5 No, z is undefined. item contains a list of integers. 

 I think what you're trying to do is this: 

 #z defined elsewhere
item = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

for i in item:
 if i not in z: print i
 

 As has been stated in other answers, you may want to try using sets. 
 #6 Your code is a no-op. By the definition of the loop, "item" has to be in Z. A "For ... in" loop in Python means "Loop though the list called 'z', each time you loop, give me the next item in the list, and call it 'item'" 

 http://docs.python.org/tutorial/controlflow.html#for-statements 

 I think your confusion arises from the fact that you're using the variable name "item" twice, to mean two different things. 
 #7 You are reassigning item to the values in z as you iterate through z. So the first time in your for loop, item = 0, next item = 1, etc... You are never checking one list against the other. 

 To do it very explicitly: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; item = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
&gt;&gt;&gt; z = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; for elem in item:
... if elem not in z:
...  print elem
...
