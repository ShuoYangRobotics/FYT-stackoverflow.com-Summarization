 Answers (Total-7): #0 I'd recomend installing macports (latest svn trunk) and installing mysql from there. 

 sudo port install mysql5-server 

 Download the MySQL-python-1.2.2 source 

 make sure /opt/local/lib/mysql5/bin is in your path or edit site.cfg to include: 

 mysql_config = /opt/local/lib/mysql5/bin/mysql_config
 

 Comment out line 38 of _mysql.c 

 // #define uint unsigned int
 

 Then run: 

 sudo python setup.py install
 

 should be all good. 
 #1 On MAC OS X 10.6, Install the package as usual. The dynamic import error occurs because of wrong DYLD path. Export the path and open up a python terminal. 

 $ sudo python setup.py clean 

 $ sudo python setup.py build 

 $ sudo python setup.py install 

 $ export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/mysql/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH 

 $python 

 
 
  import MySQLdb 
 
 

 Now import MySQLdb should work fine. 

 You may also want to manually remove the build folder, before build and install. The clean command does not do a proper task of cleaning up the build files. 
 #2 First and foremost, make sure that XCode is installed. Without XCode, many pieces of the built-in Apache2 server important to developers are missing; most notably, the GNU Compiler Collection , which I would think to be requisite for MySQL bindings.

 You'll have more fun pulling out your teeth. MySQL/Django/Mac is a disaster. This is the farthest I've gotten: 

 Get MySQLDB 1.2.3 
Go into that and modify setup_posix.py: 

 Change: 

 mysql_config.path = "mysql_config"
 

 To (depending on the version number of your MySQL): 

 mysql_config.path = "/usr/local/mysql-5.1.34-osx10.5-x86_64/bin/mysql_config"
 

 python setup.py build
python setup.py install 

 Here's a good article 
 #4 1) Xcode was installed. 

 2) Follow these instructions for setting up apache/php/mysql: 

 http://maestric.com/doc/mac/apache_php_mysql_snow_leopard 

 3) I installed the free 32-bit version of EPD (this is optional but I wanted numpy/scipy). 

 4) Make sure you have these lines in your ~/.profile (the second line is only if you installed EPD): 

 export PATH=/usr/local/mysql/bin/:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:$PATH
export PATH="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin:${PATH}" 

 5) Downloaded mysqldb and run: 

 python setup.py build 

 sudo python setup.py install 

 6) Install the official release of Django or web2py. Everything worked after that. You can try the "Writing Your First Django App, Part 1" to test it out where in settings.py use: 

 DATABASE_ENGINE = 'mysql' 
DATABASE_NAME = 'Django Polls' 
DATABASE_USER = ' * ' 
DATABASE_PASSWORD = ' * ' 
DATABASE_HOST = '127.0.0.1' 
DATABASE_PORT = '3306'    

 7) I also use Navicat Lite and Sequel Pro for working with MySQL. 

 8) Pydev is a nice IDE to use with Django. 
 #5 
 Install the newest 64bit DMG version of MySQL. Remember to backup your databases if you already have MySQL installed. 
 enter this line in terminal: 

 sudo ln -s /usr/local/mysql/lib /usr/local/mysql/lib/mysql 
 Edit the file setup_posix in the mysql-python installation directory. 
 

 Change the line 

 mysql_config.path = "mysql_config"
 

 to 

 mysql_config.path = "/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config"
 

 
 Myslq-Python needs a 64bit Version of Python. The new Python 2.7 64bit version creates an alias in /usr/local/bin/python. 
 Enter the following lines in the mysql-python folder: 
 

 sudo /usr/local/bin/python setup.py clean
sudo ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" /usr/local/bin/python setup.py build
sudo /usr/local/bin/python setup.py install 

 And finally try it out: 

 python
import MySQLdb
 
 #6 One of the key things here is to make sure you're running both MySQL and the Python adaptor in 64 bit. The default Python 2.6.1 install on Snow Leopard is 64 bit so you must install MySQL in 64 bit and build the MySQLdb adapter in 64 bit. 

 
 Make sure you have the latest Xcode installed 
 Install 64-bit MySQL from DMG - http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mirror.php?id=401941#mirrors 
 Download MySQL-python-1.2.3 from http://download.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/mysql-python/MySQL-python-1.2.3.tar.gz 
 Extract and make the following edit to site.cfg: 

 mysql_config = /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config
 
 Then from your terminal run 

 ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install
 
 

 You should then open a Python shell and type: 

 import MySQLdb
 

 If you don't get any errors you're golden.
