Question (ID-4449305): Django framework howto's for beginners Are there any good howto's or tutorials for learning django framework. The howto on the official site is too advanced. I have learnt python, but I have not worked with any other web frameworks.

 #1 nixnotwin, I understand you are good with Web Programming in the first place. If not, start with http://webpython.codepoint.net/ to understand the Basic Concepts and then head over to the Django tutorial. 
 #2 Some books/tutorials that are not already mentioned: 

 Django by example 

 A book with some standard applications - Djen of Django 

 Tutorial for beginners - Get started with Django 
 #3 I suggest you go over to http://www.showmedo.com as they have screencasts of various programming languages, frameworks, some really good Django tutorials for beginners and even one about Django debugging by Eric Holscher. 
 #4 Once you get acquainted with the url system and the Model/View/Template paradigm, you can start playing with the Admin interface and learn from it.
Then you can try to build your own test application. 
 #5 There is http://www.aprendendodjango.com/ (link in portuguese) , which is a site that teachs django aiming non-programmers.
