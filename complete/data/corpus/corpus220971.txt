 Only free (for 10 MB) one listed there: http://www.alwaysdata.com 
 #1 new kid on the block!
 HelioHost 

 I have already registered - time will tell what comes out of this.
Looks too good, gotta say! 
 #2 See http://djangofriendly.com/hosts/ - the only free is already mentioned here AlwaysData, but you can find a plenty of cheap options. WebFaction and djangohosting.ch seems to be good (and cheap) choices for a start. 
 #3 You should take a look at shellmix.com which provide free shell accounts on their machines. 

 Along with the free account, you have access to python and django, free of charge . 

 With Shellmix.com : 

 
 You can run what you want (according with the general rules of use of the service) 
 You can run 20 background process 
 You have access to programming environment:
c, c++, tcl, python, perl, java, php, ruby, rubygems, ruby on rails, 
 Your home directory is protected from other users 
 You can provide own website 
 You can park own domain free 
 You have your own virtual host domain 
 

 Here is the full list of software already installed . 

 Along with the free account, you have 200 MB Hard Drive space, and 10MB MySQL database. 
 #4 try http://ep.io . They provide good django hosting and the provide some free limits which would surface for test purposes. They also include means to install third party packages like south. Unlike Google App Engine Data store, they have postgresql and mysql. But the plans could also be upgraded (must pay for this).

 #6 Unfortunately, I think there is no free django hostings, at least with public status. 

 You can try to find something not expensive here or here . 

 Not an AD, only personal experience:
Among others, I like Ukrainian hoster TopHost (TopHost.com.ua), they have no english page, so write directly sales@tophost.com.ua, their Django tariff 11$/month, and they give 2 free month for year, if you're hosting python project. 
 #7 These guys offer free Django hosting:

 Haven't tried them, but it's worth a shot!? 
 #8 Amazon EC2 could be a choice. The cost will depend on your needs and they offer a free tier plan during a year. 

 If you don't want to configure your system from scratch BitNami offers a public BitNami DjangoStack AMI that includes Python, Django, Apache with mod_wsgi, MySQL and PostgreSQL already configured. 

 You could also use BitNami Cloud Hosting . It makes easier to manage your severs (start/stop, basic monitoring, resize images, schedule backups,...) we offer a free developer plan (you will still be charged by the Amazon if you are not part of the free tier). 

 Also mention that BitNami offers free native installers and virtual machines with the same environment that the AMI. This makes easier to develop locally and then deploy your application in the BitNami DjangoStack AMI.
