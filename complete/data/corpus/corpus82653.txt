 #1 James Bennett has an interesting take on this question: 

 
 “where can I find a good Django-powered blogging application” is probably at the top of the frequently-asked questions list both on django-users and in the IRC; part of this is simply that, right now, there is no “definitive” Django blogging application; there are a bunch of them available if you go looking, but you’re not likely to get anyone to recommend one of them as “the” Django blogging app (unless the person doing the recommending happens to be the author of one of them). 
 

 The blog entry also has a list. 
 #2 Byteflow is a blog engine, written on Python, using Django 
 #3 The book Practical Django Projects provides a tutorial on how to create a Django blogging app. 
 #4 Django's powerful admin interface and easy ORM makes it a 30 minute job to build a blog that propably fits your needs; Why look for a 3rd party product when you can make it yourself very quickly? 
 #5 Nathan Borror has a great package of 'basic apps' that has a blog. These are well written, well documented apps that you should try out, get ideas from, etc.
