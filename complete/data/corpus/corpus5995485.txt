Question (ID-5995485): Backpropagation through time Does anyone know of a library with a working implementation of backpropagation through time?
Any of Java/Python/C#/VB.NET/F# (preferably the last one) will do! 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 Assuming you're already using some library for BP, it should be (TM) rather straightforward to implement BPTT using BP as a step in the process. 

 The Wikipedia entry for BPTT [1] includes relevant pseudo code. 

 My own starting point, about 18 years ago, was "The Truck Backer-Upper: An Example of Self-Learning in Neural Networks" [2].

 #1 I've used NeuronDotNet only for a limited time though. It allows you to create a feed-forward BackPropagation NN. I especially liked their use of intuitively named classes. Good luck! 

 This is a .net library. 
 #2 I'm from a Java background but Encog has a .net implementation as well (and is a seriously good framework for NNets, with good time series support) 

 Can't help with an F# framework, but what domain are you coding for? If it's finance I'll reassert the "take a look at Encog" 
 #3 Perhaps pybrain would do? The docstring for its BackpropTrainer class suggests that it does backpropagation through time: 

 class BackpropTrainer(Trainer):
 """Trainer that trains the parameters of a module according to a
 supervised dataset (potentially sequential) by backpropagating the errors
 (through time)."""
 
 #4 What about this one ? Just a Google search to help... 
 #5 I've had good experiences with Weka - In my view one of the best and almost certainly the most comprehensive general purpose machine learning libraries around. 

 You could certainly do BPTT with Weka - you may find a ready made classifier that does what you need but even if not you can just chain a few normal backpropagation units together as per the very good wikipedia article on BPTT 
 #6 I made backpropagation algorithm in Java quite time ago. I uploaded it into GitHub, maybe you can find it useful: https://github.com/bernii/NeuralNetwokPerceptronKohonen 

 Let me now if it was helpful :)
