Question (ID-1308607): Python assert -- improved introspection of failure? This is a rather useless assertion error; it does not tell the values of the expression involved (assume constants used are actually variable names): 

 $ python -c "assert 6-(3*2)"
[...]
AssertionError
 

 Is there a better assert implementation in Python that is more fancy? It must not introduce additional overhead over execution (except when assert fails) .. and must turn off if -O flag is used. 

 Edit : I know about assert's second argument as a string. I don't want to write one .. as that is encoded in the expression that is being asserted. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Install your of function as sys.excepthook -- see the docs . Your function, if the second argument is AssertionError , can introspect to your heart's contents; in particular, through the third argument, the traceback, it can get the frame and exact spot in which the assert failed, getting the failing exception through the source or bytecode, the value of all relevant variables, etc. Module inspect helps. 

 Doing it in full generality is quite a piece of work, but depending on what constraints you're willing to accept in how you write your assert s it can be lightened substantially (e.g. restricting them to only local or global variables makes introspection easier than if nonlocal variables of a closure could be involved, and so forth). 
 #1 You can attach a message to an assert : 

 assert 6-(3*2), "always fails"
 

 The message can also be built dynamically: 

 assert x != 0, "x is not equal to zero (%d)" % x
 

 See The assert statement in the Python documentation for more information. 
 #2 The nose testing suite applies introspection to asserts . 

 However, AFAICT, you have to call their asserts to get the introspection: 

 import nose
def test1():
 nose.tools.assert_equal(6, 5+2)
 

 results in 

 
C:\temp\py>C:\Python26\Scripts\nosetests.exe -d test.py
F
======================================================================
FAIL: test.test1
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "C:\Python26\lib\site-packages\nose-0.11.1-py2.6.egg\nose\case.py", line
183, in runTest
 self.test(*self.arg)
 File "C:\temp\py\test.py", line 3, in test1
 nose.tools.assert_equal(6, 5+2)
AssertionError: 6 != 7
>> raise self.failureException, \
   (None or '%r != %r' % (6, 7))
 

 Notice the AssertionError there. When my line was just assert 6 == 5+2 , I would get: 

 
C:\temp\py>C:\Python26\Scripts\nosetests.exe -d test.py
F
======================================================================
FAIL: test.test1
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):

 self.test(*self.arg)
 File "C:\temp\py\test.py", line 2, in test1
 assert 6 == 5 + 2
AssertionError:
>> assert 6 == 5 + 2

 

 Also, I'm not sure offhand if their asserts are skipped with -O , but that would be a very quick check. 
 #3 As @Mark Rushakoff said nose can evaluate failed asserts. It works on the standard assert too. 

 # test_error_reporting.py
def test():
 a,b,c = 6, 2, 3
 assert a - b*c
 

 nosetests ' help: 

 $ nosetests --help|grep -B2 assert
 -d, --detailed-errors, --failure-detail
      Add detail to error output by attempting to evaluate
      failed asserts [NOSE_DETAILED_ERRORS]
 

 Example: 

 $ nosetests -d

 #4 Add a message to your assertion, which will be displayed if the assertion fails: 

 $ python -c "assert 6-(3*2), '6-(3*2)'"
Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "&lt;string&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
AssertionError: 6-(3*2)
 

 The only way I can think of to provide this automatically would be to contain the assertion in a procedure call, and then inspect the stack to get the source code for that line. The additional call would, unfortunately, introduce overhead into the test and would not be disabled with -O . 
 #5 It sounds like what you really want to do is to set up a debugger breakpoint just before the assert and inspect from your favorite debugger as much as you like.
