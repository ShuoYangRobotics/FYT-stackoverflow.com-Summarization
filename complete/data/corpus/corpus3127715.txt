Question (ID-3127715): Is there any linux distribution that comes with python 3? I would like to know if there is any Linux distribution where you can easily install and use Python 3. This means a distribution that will provide not only Python 3 binaries and updates but also python modules. 

 I know that probably we are not going to see any python 3 as the default python interpretor so soon but at least I would like to see latest 2.x as default (2.6+) one and the alternative one already installed. 

 Probably it is a question between major distributions: Ubuntu, Fedora or Suse? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Ubuntu 10.04 comes by default w/ Python 2.6.5, but the following python 3 packages are in the standard repositories as well: 

 
python3     python3.1-minimal  python3-dev
python3.0    python3.1-profiler  python3-doc
python3.1    python3.1-tk   python3-examples
python3.1-celementtree python3.1-wsgiref  python3-gdbm
python3.1-cjkcodecs  python3.2    python3-gdbm-dbg
python3.1-ctypes  python3-all    python3-minimal
python3.1-dbg   python3-all-dbg   python3-pkg-resources
python3.1-dev   python3-all-dev   python3-profiler
python3.1-doc   python3-bsddb   python3-setuptools
python3.1-elementtree python3-bsddb3   python3-tk
python3.1-examples  python3-bsddb3-dbg  python3-tk-dbg
python3.1-gdbm   python3-dbg
 

 For the rest you'll have to rely on easy_install and pip (of course, after manually installing them).

 update: 
for *ubuntu 11.04 the list is (as expected) a bit longer) note that I left out the python3.1- and python3.2- prefixed packages):

 #1 Fedora, starting with 13 , allows python3 to be installed in parallel with python2 and it includes some of the more popular python3 modules. 
 #2 I think most distros have it. Debian has it so all derived distros (Ubuntu et. all) do. Fedora as well. It's just that it's not used for the standard system utilities so just typing python will give you a 2.x interpreter. 
 #3 Gentoo has Python3 (I have 2.6.4-r1 and 3.1.2-r3 installed, 2.6 being the default). A quick search reveals that ebuilds of python libraries tested on both 2.x and 3.x have already been built for both versions on my machine (thank God for python-updater , obviously). 

 Gentoo + Python developing is a very nice combination (if you do like the way Gentoo works, that is). 
 #4 All of them have the repositories, but if you care for one that has python3 as default, I only know of ArchLinux. 
 #5 According to DistroWatch , the following distributions currently include Python version 3: 

 
 Arch Linux 
 ArchBang Linux 
 Calculate Linux 
 CTKArch 
 FreeBSD 
 Frugalware Linux: current, 1.5 
 Funtoo Linux 
 Gentoo Linux 
 KahelOS 
 Litrix Linux 
 NetBSD 
 PapugLinux 
 Source Mage GNU/Linux 
 Toorox 
 UTUTO
