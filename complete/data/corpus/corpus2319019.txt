Question (ID-2319019): using regex to remove comments from source files So I'm new to python, (i wrote my first bit of code I it today)
(I'm relitivly experienced in C, and decent in C++, Java and assember - if abit out of practice)
I'm, making a program to automate the writing of some C code, (I'm writing to parse stigns into enumerations with the same name)
C's handleing of stings is, well it's not that great.
So some people have been nagging me to try python (actually they have been nagging me to makepython my primairy language) 

 I'm findin python kinda wierd, it's very loose. 

 anyway I made a function that is supposed to remove c syle /* COMMENT */ and //COMMENT
from a string:
He's the code: 

 def removeComments(string):
   re.sub(re.compile("/\*.*?\*/",re.DOTALL ) ,"" ,string) # remove all occurance streamed comments (/*COMMENT */) from string
   re.sub(re.compile("//.*?\n" ) ,"" ,string) # remove all occurance singleline comments (//COMMENT\n ) from string
 

 It's been a while since i used RegEx too, and even then i'e only had to use it less than a dozen times before. 

 So I tryed this code out. 

 str="/* spam * spam */ eggs"
removeComments(str)
print str
 

 And it apparently did nothing. 

 Any suggestions as to what I've done wrong? 

 Theres a saying i've heard acouple of times:
If you have a problem and you try to solve it with RegEx you endup with two problems 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 I would suggest using a REAL parser like SimpleParse or PyParsing . SimpleParse requires that you actually know EBNF, but is very fast. PyParsing has its own EBNF-like syntax but that is adapted for Python and makes it a breeze to build powerfully accurate parsers. 

 Edit: 

 Here is an example of how easy it is to use PyParsing in this context: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; test = '/* spam * spam */ eggs'
&gt;&gt;&gt; import pyparsing
&gt;&gt;&gt; comment = pyparsing.nestedExpr("/*", "*/").suppress()
&gt;&gt;&gt; print comment.transformString(test)   
' eggs'
 

 Here is a more complex example using single and multi-line comments. 

 Before: 

 /*
 * multiline comments
 * abc 2323jklj
 * this is the worst C code ever!!
*/
void
do_stuff ( int shoe, short foot ) {
 /* this is a comment
  * multiline again! 
  */
 exciting_function(whee);
} /* extraneous comment */
 

 After: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; print comment.transformString(code) 

void
do_stuff ( int shoe, short foot ) {

  exciting_function(whee);
} 
 

 It leaves an extra newline wherever it stripped comments, but that could be addressed. 
 #1 You are doing it wrong. 

 Regex is for Regular Languages , which C isn't. 
 #2 re.sub returns a string, so changing your code to the following will give results: 

 def removeComments(string):
 string = re.sub(re.compile("/\*.*?\*/",re.DOTALL ) ,"" ,string) # remove all occurance streamed comments (/*COMMENT */) from string
 string = re.sub(re.compile("//.*?\n" ) ,"" ,string) # remove all occurance singleline comments (//COMMENT\n ) from string
 return string
 
 #3 I see several things you might want to revise. 

 First, Python passes objects by value, but some object types are immutable. Strings and integers are among these immutable types. So if you pass a string to a function, any changes to the string you make within the function won't affect the string you passed in. You should try returning a string instead. Furthermore, within the removeComments() function, you need to assign the value returned by re.sub() to a new variable -- like any function that takes a string as an argument, re.sub() will not modify the string. 

 Second, I would echo what others have said about parsing C code. Regular expressions are not the best way to go here. 
 #4 I would recommend you read this page that has a quite detailed analyzis of the problem and gives a good understanding on why your approach doesn't work: http://ostermiller.org/findcomment.html 

 Short version: The regex you are looking for is this: 

 (/\*([^*]|[\r\n]|(\*+([^*/]|[\r\n])))*\*+/)|(//.*)
 

 This should match both types of comment blocks. If you are having troubles following it read the page i linked. 
 #5 As noted in one of my other comments, comment nesting isn't really the problem (in C, comments don't nest, though a few compilers to support nested comments anyway). The problem is with things like string literals, that can contain the exact same character sequence as a comment delimiter without actually being one. 

 As Mike Graham said, the right tool for the job is a lexer. A parser is unnecessary and would be overkill, but a lexer is exactly the right thing. As it happens, I posted a (partial) lexer for C (and C++) earlier this morning. It doesn't attempt to correctly identify all lexical elements (i.e. all keywords and operators) but it's entirely sufficient for stripping comments. It won't do any good on the "using Python" front though, as it's written entirely in C (it predates my using C++ for much more than experimental code). 
 #6 mystring="""
blah1 /* comments with
multiline */

blah2
blah3
// double slashes comments
blah4 // some junk comments

"""
for s in mystring.split("*/"):
 s=s[:s.find("/*")]
 print s[:s.find("//")]
 

 output 

 $ ./python.py

blah1
