Question (ID-4350879): converting white space in python files? I have some tab formatted code in python and I have some space formatted code in python. 

 Integrating the code in a pain... my editor wants to work in tabs or spaces, but not both. 

 Is there a command line function in linux or, well, anything which will convert python code formatting one way or the other? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 'man expand' for some info 

 it's in coreutils on Debian 
 #1 You can use expand and unexpand Unix commands for this. 

 Generally if I code in vim for instance I have it automatically convert tabs to spaces. 

 my ~/.vimrc looks something like this: 

 set expandtab
set tabstop=4
 
 #2 reindent.py is a nifty utility script which converts any python .py file into one using 4-space indents and no tabs. 

 This is useful for "normalizing" code from disparate sources, assuming you're willing to settle on the 4-space standard. (Or, if you want tabs, you could run reindent.py followed by the unix unexpand command.) 

 PS. Your installation of Python may have reindent.py already installed in a Tools or Examples folder. On Ubuntu it is provided by the python-examples package, and is located at /usr/share/doc/python2.6/examples/Tools/scripts/reindent.py . 
 #3 Many editors (vi for example) will convert tabs to or from spaces when you indent a line. So set the tab settings however you want, then indent the entire file 1 step, and then unindent one step, and your're done. 

 Vim commands: 

 1GVG &lt;-- select entire file (i have this bound to CTRL-A)
&gt;  &lt;-- indent one step
1GVG &lt;-- select again 
&lt;  &lt;--- unindent one step
 
 #4 How about Perl: perl -pe 's/(.*?)\t/$1.(" " x (4-length($1)%4))/ge' file_with_tabs.txt 

 python (this is from the source of Markdown...): 

 def _detab_sub(self, match):
 g1 = match.group(1)
 return g1 + (' ' * (self.tab_width - len(g1) % self.tab_width))
def _detab(self, text):

 if '\t' not in text:
  return text
 return self._detab_re.subn(self._detab_sub, text)[0]
 
 #5 A good programmer's editor will have a command that converts tabs to spaces or vice/versa; you can also do it with search-and-replace in the editor.
