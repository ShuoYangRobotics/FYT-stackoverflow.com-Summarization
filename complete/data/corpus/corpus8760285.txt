 Answers (Total-6): #0 Using sed : 

 sed ':a;{N;s/\n/, /};ba' INPUT_FILE
 

 Explanation: 

 I am no expert on sed , but this is what the above one-liner means: 

 
 :a 

 :label command creates a named label a . This when used with ba branches to the label. This is useful for creating loops and escaping to the end of the script to print the current pattern space. 
 N 

 N just appends the next line to the pattern space with \n . 
 s/\n/, / 

 Since the new line has been appended to the pattern space with a \n , we use this substitution to replace the \n with a , and space as per the requirements of OP. 
 

 Test: 

 [jaypal:~/Temp] cat file
Paul
Pammy
Jacob
Robin

[jaypal:~/Temp] sed ':a;{N;s/\n/, /};ba' file
Paul, Pammy, Jacob, Robin
 
 #1 awk : 

 $ awk -v ORS=, 1 file.txt | sed 's/,$/\n/'
Paul,Pammy,Jacob,Robin
 

 
 -v ORS=, set output record separated by , 
 1 TRUE, so print every record 
 sed 's/,$/\n/' remove ending , 
 

 sed : 

 $ sed -n '1h;1!H;${g;s/\n/,/gp}' file.txt
Paul,Pammy,Jacob,Robin
 

 
 -n suppress output 
 1h put first line to holding-space 
 1!H append second~last lines to holding-space 
 ${...} do ... against last line 
 g get all from holding-space 
 s/\n/,/g replace \n with , 
 p print out 
 

 tr: 

 $ tr '\n' ',' &lt;file.txt | sed 's/,$/\n/'
 
 #2 this seems to work, uses 'tr' command on unix/linux 

 tr '\n', ',' &lt; yourfile
 
 #3 In Python 

 ', '.join(open("yourinputfile").read().splitlines())
 

 In Bash 

 cat test.txt|xargs -I {} echo -n {},
 
 #4 In Perl: 

 perl -pe 'chomp; print ", " if $. - 1' 
 
 #5 This might work for you: 

 paste -d, -s file.txt
