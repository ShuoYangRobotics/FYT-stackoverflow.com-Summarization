Question (ID-581343): Similar to Pass in Python for C# In python we can .. 

 a = 5
if a == 5:
   pass #Do Nothing
else:
  print "Hello World"
 

 I wonder if it a similar way to do this in C# 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Use empty braces. 

 int a = 5;
if (a == 5) {}
else {
 Console.Write("Hello World");
}
 
 #1 Why not just say: 

 if (a != 5) 
{
 Console.Write("Hello World");
}
 
 #2 Is pass used in the context of a loop? If so, use the continue statement: 

 for (var i = 0; i &lt; 10; ++i)
{
 if (i == 5)
 {
  continue;
 }

 Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
}
 
 #3 Empty block: 

 {}
 
 #4 Either use an empty block as suggested in other answers, or reverse the condition: 

 if (a != 5)
{
 Console.WriteLine("Hello world");
}
 

 or more mechanically: 

 if (!(a == 5))
{
 Console.WriteLine("Hello world");
}
 
 #5 A better question would be why you would want to do such a thing. If you're not planning on doing anything then leave it out, rather. 

 int a = 5;
if (a != 5) {
 Console.Write("Hello World");
}
