Question (ID-5097092): python lambda, filtering out non alpha characters i'm trying to keep only the letters in a string. i am trying to do something like this: 

 s = '1208uds9f8sdf978qh39h9i#H(&amp;#*H(&amp;H97dgh'
s_ = lambda: letter if letter.isalpha(), s
 

 this errors out. how would a working version look? 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 Alternately: 

 s_ = filter(lambda c: c.isalpha(), s)
 
 #1 One handy way to manipulate strings is using a generator function and the join method: 

 result = "".join( letter for letter in s if letter.isalpha() )
 
 #2 You don't need a lambda function: 

 result = ''.join(c for c in input_str if c.isalpha())
 

 If you really want to use a lambda function you could write it as follows: 

 result = ''.join(filter(lambda c:str.isalpha(c), input_str))
 

 But this can also be simplified to: 

 result = ''.join(filter(str.isalpha, input_str))
 
 #3 how about 

 re.sub('[^a-zA-Z]','', s)
 

 or 

 "".join([x for x in s if x.isalpha()])
 
 #4 You probably want a list comprehension here: 

 s_ = [letter for letter in s if letter.isalpha()]
 

 However, this will give you a list of strings (each one character long). To convert this into a single string, you can use join : 

 s2 = ''.join(s_)
 

 If you want, you can combine the two into a single statement: 

 s_ = ''.join(letter for letter in s if letter.isalpha())
 

 If you particularly want or need to use a lambda function, you can use filter instead of the generator: 

 my_func = lambda letter: letter.isalpha()
s_ = ''.join(filter(my_func, s))
 
 #5 &gt;&gt;&gt; s = '1208uds9f8sdf978qh39h9i#H(&amp;#*H(&amp;H97dgh'
&gt;&gt;&gt; ''.join(e for e in s if e.isalpha())
'udsfsdfqhhiHHHdgh'
 
 #6 This is kind of the long way round, but will let you create a filter for any arbitrary set of characters. 

 import string

def strfilter(validChars):
 vc = set(validChars)
 def filter(s):
  return ''.join(ch for ch in s if ch in vc)
 return filter

filterAlpha = strfilter(string.letters)
filterAlpha('1208uds9f8sdf978qh39h9i#H(&amp;#*H(&amp;H97dgh') # -&gt; 'udsfsdfqhhiHHHdgh'
