Question (ID-4028844): Simplify this python code I've written a program to check if my thought about solution on paper is right (and it is). 

 The task: how many zeros is in the back of multiplication of all numbers from 10 to 200. 

 It is 48 and it is a simple to calculate manually. 

 I never write on python seriously and this is what I get: 

 mul = 1
for i in range(10, 200 + 1):
 mul *= i

string = str(mul)
string = string[::-1]
count = 0;
for c in str(string):
 if c == '0':
  count += 1
 else:
  break

print count
print mul
 

 I bet it is possible to write the same more elegant in such language like a python. 

 ps: yes, it is a homework, but not mine - i just helped a guy ;-) 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 A straight-forward implementation that doesn't involve calculating the factorial (so that it works with big numbers, ie 2000000!) (edited) : 

 fives = 0
twos = 0
for i in range(10, 201):
 while i % 5 == 0:
  fives = fives + 1
  i /= 5
 while i % 2 == 0:
  twos = twos + 1
  i /= 2
print(min(fives, twos))
 
 #1 import math

answer = str(math.factorial(200) / math.factorial(9))
count = len(answer) - len(answer.rstrip('0'))
 

 
 Import the math library 
 Calculate the factorial of 200 and take away the first 9 numbers 
 Strip away zeros from the right and find out the difference in lengths 
 
 #2 import itertools
mul = reduce(lambda x,y: x*y, range(10, 200+1))
zeros = itertools.takewhile(lambda s: s == "0", reversed(str(mul)))
print len(list(zeros))
 

 The second line calculates the product, the third gets an iterator of all trailing zeros in that number, the last prints the number of that zeros. 
 #3 len(re.search('0*$', str(reduce(lambda x, y: x*y, range(10, 200 + 1),1))).group(0))
 
 #4 print sum(1 + (not i%25) + (not i%125) for i in xrange(10,201,5))
 
 #5 Do you mean zeroes? What is null otherwise? 

 
 Wouldn't some mathematics make it simpler? 
 
 How many 5s in 200 is len([x for x in range(5, 201, 5)]) = 40 
 
 How many 25s in 200 is len([x for x in range(25, 201, 5) if x%25 == 0]) = 8 
 
 How many 125s in 200 is len([x for x in range(120, 201, 5) if x%125 == 0]) = 1 
 

 Total 5s = 49 

 200! = 5^49 * 2 ^49 * (other numbers not divisible by 2 or 5) 

 So there are 49 zeroes 
 #6 mul = str(reduce(lambda x,y: x*y, xrange(10, 201)))
count = len(mul) - len(mul.rstrip("0"))
