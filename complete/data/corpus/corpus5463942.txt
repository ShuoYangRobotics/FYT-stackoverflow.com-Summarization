Question (ID-5463942): how do you protect your source with python? python has been used to develop commercial software, but how can you make money from your programs if the source is always available? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Your source isn't as valuable as you think it is, that is to say, you won't make money from your source simply because it's proprietary to you. When you sell software, you sell your vision, your marketing, your understanding of problem domain and your support. Just because someone else obtains your source, does not mean they'll be able to turn around and start selling an identical product. There are also copyright laws that protect that. 

 Having said that, a lot of commercial python software ships with either the source included (as I said, not the end of the world), or their modules compiled to Python bytecode ( .pyc files) or built as executables using tools like py2exe. 

 If you built a Python service, that code is running on your own machines and your customers and clients won't have access to it. 
 #1 Binary software can also be copied, so it does not really matter if you can read the source code or not. Even if you are not just distributing programs in source form, but allow for modification and distribution as with open source software, you can still have a successful business, see:

 #2 
 compile it and distribute the executable file 
 sell it as a service rather than a program 
 sell support and customization, not the program itself 
 
 #3 Take a look at this question 
 #4 Because most people are honest. If your licence says you can't redistribute the source, most people won't. After all, it's trivial to download a crack even for commercial software where the source isn't available - and most people don't do that, either. 
 #5 If your target platform is windows, you can compile it by py2exe or py2win,
but i agree with Hugh Bothwell
