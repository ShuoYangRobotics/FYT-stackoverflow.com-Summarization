Question (ID-3108042): Get max key in dictionary I have a dictionary that looks like this 

 MyCount= {u'10': 1, u'1': 2, u'3': 2, u'2': 2, u'5': 2, u'4': 2, u'7': 2, u'6': 2, u'9': 2, u'8': 2}
 

 I need highest key which is 10 but i if try max(MyCount.keys()) it gives 9 as highest. 
 Same for max(MyCount) . 

 The dictionary is created dynamically. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 This is because u'9' &gt; u'10' , since they are strings . 

 To compare numerically, use int as a key. 

 max(MyCount.keys(), key=int)
 
 #1 You need to compare the actual numerical values. Currently you're comparing the strings lexigraphically. 

 max(MyCount, key=int)
 
 #2 max(map(int, MyCount))
 

 Or if you want the return value to be the original string: 

 max(MyCount, key=int)
 
 #3 Since your keys are strings, they are compared lexicographically and '9' is the max value indeed. 

 What you are looking for is something like: max(int(k) for k in MyCount) 
 #4 This is your problem: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; u'10' &gt; u'9'
False
 

 Effectively, you're comparing the characters '1' and '9' here. What you want is probably this: 

 max(long(k) for k in MyCount)
 

 or create the dictionary with numbers as keys (instead of strings). 
 #5 You use max for string values. You must convert them to int. Try something like: 

 print(max([int(s) for s in MyCount.keys()]))
 

 Or as Tim suggested: 

 print(max(int(s) for s in MyCount))
