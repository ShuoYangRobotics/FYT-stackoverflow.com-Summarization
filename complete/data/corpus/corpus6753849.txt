Question (ID-6753849): How do I removes \n founds between double quotes from a string? Good day, 

 I am totally new to Python and I am trying to do something with string. 

 I would like to remove any \n characters found between double quotes ( " ) only , from a given string : 

 str = "foo,bar,\n\"hihi\",\"hi\nhi\"" 

 The desired output must be: 

 foo,bar
"hihi", "hihi"
 

 Edit: 

 The desired output must be similar to that string:
 after = "foo,bar,\n\"hihi\",\"hihi\"" 

 Any tips? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 This should do: 

 def removenewlines(s):
 inquotes = False
 result = []

 for chunk in s.split("\""):
  if inquotes: chunk.replace("\n", "")
  result.append(chunk)
  inquotes = not inquotes

 return "\"".join(result)
 
 #1 A simple stateful filter will do the trick. 

 in_string = False
input_str = 'foo,bar,\n"hihi","hi\nhi"'
output_str = ''

for ch in input_str:
 if ch == '"': in_string = not in_string
 if ch == '\n' and in_string: continue
 output_str += ch

print output_str
 
 #2 &gt;&gt;&gt; str = "foo,bar,\n\"hihi\",\"hi\nhi\""
&gt;&gt;&gt; re.sub(r'".*?"', lambda x: x.group(0).replace('\n',''), str, flags=re.S)
'foo,bar,\n"hihi","hihi"'
&gt;&gt;&gt;
 

 Short explanation: 

 
 re.sub is a substitution engine. It takes a regular expression, a substitution function or expression, a string to work on, and other options. 
 The regular expression ".*?" catches strings in double quotes that don't in themselves contain other double quotes (it has a small bug, because it wouldn't catch strings which contain escaped double-quotes). 
 lambda x: ... is an expression which can be used wherever a function can be used. 
 The substitution engine calls the function with the match object.
x.group(0) is "the whole matched string", which also includes the double quotes.
x.group(0) is the matched string with '\n' substituted for ''. 
 The flag re.S tells re.sub that '\n' is a valid character to catch with a dot. 
 

 Personally I find longer functions that say the same thing more tiring and less readable, in the same way that in C I would prefer i++ to i = i + 1 . It's all about what one is used to reading. 
 #3 Quick note: Python strings can use '' or "" as delimiters, so it's common practice to use one when the other is inside your string, for readability. Eg: 'foo,bar,\n"hihi","hi\nhi"' . On to the question... 

 You probably want the python regexp module: re .
In particular, the substitution function is what you want here. There are a bunch of ways to do it, but one quick option is to use a regexp that identifies the "" substrings, then calls a helper function to strip any \n out of them... 

 import re
def helper(match):
 return match.group().replace("\n","")
input = 'foo,bar,\n"hihi","hi\nhi"'
result = re.sub('(".*?")', helper, input, flags=re.S)
 
 #4 This regex works (assuming that quotes are correctly balanced): 

 import re
result = re.sub(r"""(?x) # verbose regex
 \n  # Match a newline
 (?!  # only if it is not followed by
  (?: 
  [^"]*" # an even number of quotes
  [^"]*" # (and any other non-quote characters)
  )*  # (yes, zero counts, too)
  [^"]*
  \z  # until the end of the string.
 )""", 
 "", str)
 
 #5 Something like this 

 Break the CSV data into columns. 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; m=re.findall(r'(".*?"|[^"]*?)(,\s*|\Z)',s,re.M|re.S)
&gt;&gt;&gt; m
[('foo', ','), ('bar', ',\n'), ('"hihi"', ','), ('"hi\nhi"', ''), ('', '')]
 

 Replace just the field instances of '\n' with ''. 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; [ field.replace('\n','') + sep for field,sep in m ]
['foo,', 'bar,\n', '"hihi",', '"hihi"', '']
 

 Reassemble the resulting stuff (if that's really the point.) 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; "".join(_)
'foo,bar,\n"hihi","hihi"'
