Question (ID-6914880): Python adding variable as value in a dict I'm a beginner in Python and have a problem. I can't add the value of a variable to a dictionary. 

 f.e 

 name=input('Input the name: ')
dict['Name']=name 
 

 and here's the error: 

 TypeError: 'type' object does not support item assignment 
 

 Could anyone help me? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Don't name your dictionary dict . That's a built-in. Name it something else, and you example should work, provided the dict object is initialized. 

 my_dict = {}
name=input('Input the name: ')
my_dict['Name']=name 
 
 #1 You have to instantiate the dictionary before: 

 d = dict()
d['Name'] = name
 
 #2 You may either 

 d = {}
d["Name"] = "yourName"
 

 or 

 d = {"Name": "yourName"}
 

 both would work 
 #3 You probably wanted to do 

 dict(Name = name)
 
 #4 Given your snippet, i believe you named your dictionnary dict , which is a python built-in name. You should use another name for your variable ( always avoid using built-in names for variables ) like: 

 d = {}
d['Name'] = name
 
 #5 You can use the following code too: 

 d = dict(Name=input('Input the name: '))
