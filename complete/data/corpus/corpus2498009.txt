Question (ID-2498009): Best way to encrypt a directory of files? I need to programatically encrypt a directory of files, like in a .zip or whatever. Preferably password protected obviously. 

 How can I accomplish this, and WHAT IS the BEST encryption way to do it, if applicable? 

 Programming language doesn't matter. I am dictioned in all syntax.

 tar and gzip the directory. 
 Generate a random bit stream of equal size to the file 
 Run bitwise XOR on the streams 
 

 Only truly secure method is a truly random one time pad. 
 #1 I still say 7-zip is the answer. It hasn't been "cracked". 
 #2 4096 -Bit ( Open )PGP: 'Pretty Good' Privacy !
 

 
GnuPG is the GNU project's complete and free implementation of the OpenPGP standard as defined by RFC4880 . GnuPG allows to encrypt and sign your data and communication, features a versatile key managment system as well as access modules for all kind of public key directories. GnuPG, also known as GPG, is a command line tool with features for easy integration with other applications. A wealth of frontend applications and libraries are available. Version 2 of GnuPG also provides support for S/MIME.

 Edit: 
BouncyCastle now has OpenPGP support.

 #3 The OpenSSL library has a variety of block cipher implementations including the well-known AES. It has both a function-call interface (for use with languages like C/C++) and a program-call interface (for use in shell scripts). http://www.openssl.org/ 
 #4 Use AES . You'll find implementations in your favourite programming language by asking google for AES encryption + myfavouritelanguage . 
 #5 If you're using .NET, why not use a free compression framework ( http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SharpZipLib/ ) that supports Encryption?
