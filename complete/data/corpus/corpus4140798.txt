Question (ID-4140798): Python: Random combination from two files New to python, bear with me. I have two text files, each has a word on a line (some funny words). I want to create a third file which has the random combination of those. with a space between them. 

 Example: 

 File1:
Smile
Sad
Noob
Happy
...

File2:
Face
Apple
Orange
...

File3:
Smile Orange
Sad Apple
Noob Face
.....
 

 How can I Python this? 

 Thanks! 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 from __future__ import with_statement
import random
import os

with open('File1', 'r') as f1:
 beginnings = [word.rstrip() for word in f1]

with open('File2', 'r') as f2:
 endings = [word.rstrip() for word in f2]

with open('File3', 'w') as f3:
 for beginning in beginnings:
  f3.write('%s %s' % (beginning, random.choice(endings)))
  f3.write(os.linesep)
 
 #1 Start by parsing the input files, so you end up with a list of two lists, each containing the words in one if the files. We will also use the shuffle method in the random module to randomize them: 

 from random import shuffle

words = []
for filename in ['File1', 'File2']:
 with open(filename, 'r') as file: 
 # Opening the file using the with statement will ensure that it is properly
 # closed when your done.

 words.append((line.strip() for line in file.readlines()))
 # The readlines method returns a list of the lines in the file

 shuffle(words[-1])
 # Shuffle will randomize them
 # The -1 index refers to the last item (the one we just added)
 

 Next we have to write our list of output words to a file: 

 with open('File3', 'w') as out_file:
 for pair in zip(words):
 # The zip method will take one element from each list and pair them up

 out_file.write(" ".join(pair) + "\n")
 # The join method will take the pair of words and return them as a string, 
 # separated by a space.
 
 #2 import random 
list1 = [ x.strip() for x in open('file1.txt', 'r').readlines()]
list2 = [ x.strip() for x in open('file2.txt', 'r').readlines()]
random.shuffle(list1)
random.shuffle(list2)
for word1, word2 in zip(list1, list2):
 print word1, word2
 
 #3 Try something like this: 

 file1 = []
for line in open("file1.txt"):
 file1.append(line)
#or just list(open("file1.txt"))
...
file3 = open('file3.txt','w')
file3.write(...)
 

 and work off that. Look at the random module and its functions. ( http://docs.python.org/library/random.html ) 

 If you are new to Python, look at a tutorial like Dive into Python ( http://diveintopython.org/ ), available online. 
 #4 you can do something like 

 f = open(file,'r')
data = [" "]

while data[-1] != "":
 data += [f.readline()
# do this a second time for the second file
 

 and then 

 out = ""
from random import randint
for x in xrange(len(data)):
  y = randint(0, len(data) -1)
  if data[y] != 0: 
  out += data[y] + "\n"
  data[y] = 0

f3 = open(third file,'w+b')
f3.write(out)
 

 this is a terrible code, but it should work 
 #5 this is a quick try... 

 import random

f1 = [line.rstrip() for line in open('file1', 'r').readlines()]
f2 = [line.rstrip() for line in open('file2', 'r').readlines()]

random.shuffle(f1)
random.shuffle(f2)
out = zip(f1, f2)

f3 = open('file3', 'w')
for k, v in out:
 f3.write(k + ' ' + v + '\n')
