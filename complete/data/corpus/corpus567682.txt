Question (ID-567682): Online compilers/runtime for Java, C++, Python and ObjC? Does anyone know of a good online compiler/runtime (for C++, Java, Python, ObjC etc.) that I can access on the web? 

 What I'm looking for is something that would allow me to type in a program in a web form and to run the program and see the results online. 

 (Let's not get into the why for now. Suffice it to say for the moment that I don't always have access to a compiler/runtime, and firing up an IDE is just overkill for testing out some code snippets) 

 I know of codepad.org -- but I'm looking for something better.

 codepad.org is an online
 compiler/interpreter, and a simple
 collaboration tool. Paste your code

 give you a short URL you can use to
 share it in chat or email.

 #2 i have an java online compiler 

 http://youjavait.com/ 
 #3 This one is good for ruby. 
 #4 For C++, you could try CodeControl , Comeau or the one from code.vcer.net . 
 #5 Here is an open source one: http://codenode.org , which supports Python and Sage well, but also aims to support other languages like Ruby, R, etc. Probably the best description of Codenode is "Google docs combined with Mathematica Notebooks". 
 #6 Right now, you can use http://sagenb.org . This is a free open source online Google Docs-like programming notebook environment, which I provide (thanks to a generous grant from the National Science Foundation). Once you create an account and create a new worksheet, click on the box (fourth from left) labeled "Sage" and change it to Python. Now all the code you type in is evaluated using Python. The main drawback is that there are well over 30,000 users of this resource, so sometimes it is slow. 
 #7 I found this online java compiler and runner. It works in realtime and also with threads. Amazing !

 #8 CodeIDE is an ok one: http://www.codeide.com/ 
 #9 You can practice your SQL here . 
 #10 This works for java: http://www.zamples.com/JspExplorer/index.jsp
