Question (ID-634964): svg diagrams using python I am looking for a library to generate svg diagrams in python (I fetch data from a sql database). I have found python-gd , but it has not much documentation and last update was in 2005 so I wonder if there are any other libraries that are good for this purpose. 

 I am mostly thinking about simple line graphs, something like this :
 
 Answers (Total-10): #0 PyChart "is a Python library for creating high quality Encapsulated Postscript, PDF, PNG, or SVG charts." 
 #1 As you're looking for simple line graphics, probably, CairoPlot will fit your needs as it can generate svg output files out of the box. Take a look at this . 

 

 This example image shows only a few of its capabilities. Using the trunk version available at launchpad you'll be able to add a legend box and add axis titles. 

 Besides that, using the trunk version, it's possible to generate: 

 
 DotLine charts (the ones I believe you need) 
 Scatter charts 
 Pie/Donut charts 
 Horizontal/Vertical Bar charts 
 Gantt charts 
 
 #2 pyCairo is an option worth looking at. 
 #3 Here's a general purpose SVG library in Python: pySVG . 
 #4 Try using matplotlib . You can configure it with a SVG backend . 
 #5 You can use Graphviz to generate diagrams in SVG format. There are Python bindings to Graphviz e.g., pydot -- Python interface to Graphviz's Dot language. 
 #6 svgfig is worth a look:

 #7 svgfig looked like a more substantial project, mentioning several iterations, but the installer gave an error on mac os x. i'm working with pysvg now, will update later 
 #8 Being not exactly related to SVG plots, but searching for the same thing I have found a good source of carefully collected useful info to answer your question:

 #9 I have tried to collate a list of available charting libraries(its an ongoing work, wherein i keep updating the list) : http://blizzardzblogs.blogspot.com/2010/12/data-visualization-charts-and.html 

 I feel that protovis would do the job for you. Its 

 
 light weight, 
 generates svg (which can be exported easily) and 
 is javascript 
 

 So nothing more to learn :)
