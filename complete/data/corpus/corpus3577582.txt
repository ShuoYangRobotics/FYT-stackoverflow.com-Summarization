Question (ID-3577582): Python: How do I convert an int to its string representation with a set number of digits? Pretty much what it says up there. 

 Basically, how do I get the string produced by 

 print "%05d" % 100
 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Maybe I'm misinterpreting the question, but this should work: 

 my_string = "%05d" % 100
 
 #1 Use str.zfill(width) 
 #2 This should work too: 

 `100`.zfill(5)
 
 #3 print('{0:0=5d}'.format(100))
# 00100


 use the 0th positional argument to format
 / fill character is '0'
 / / desired width of formatted string
 / / /
{0:0=5d}
 

 For more, see the docs . 
 #4 i = 100
str(i).zfill(5)
 
 #5 If you're using Python 3, the str.format method is preferred. It was introduced in Python 2.6. (Alas, my work system is at 2.4 (and I'm not permitted to upgrade), so I can't construct and test an example.)
