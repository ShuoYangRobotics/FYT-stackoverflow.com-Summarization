Question (ID-4185061): Android Python Programming Can I program for Android using Python? I seem to have stumbled upon many links while searching... however neither of them is concrete. 

 Any suggestions? I want to write apps for Android but really don't want to get into Java for all this. 

 PS: My question is whether I can write proper, full fledged apps for Android. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Checkout Kivy . They have done a really great job so far, and I am a big fan of their work. It is still lacking some providers, but they keep adding new stuff to it everyday. First thing you need to do is to check your requirement against what they can offer based on their documentation. They have create an amazing framework for input such as multi-touch or pen handling. They use OpenGL ES internally, as a result complex graphics and visualizations can run very fast when interacting with the the application. Their process for creating an apk is also very straight forward. 
 #1 Yep, you can.
Check ASE 

 Edit:
Ok, after comments:
I haven't read the question properly. No you can't write write proper, full fledged apps for Android, but anyway check ASE. It is really cool project. 
 #2 No, not currently. ASE (Android Scripting Environment) allows you to do simple script apps, but you can only write proper Android apps in Java. 
 #3 Subset of Pygame is available for the Android also. Check it out: http://pygame.renpy.org/ 
 #4 Check the new Python for Android project 
 #5 Yes, it would be possible if someone makes an entire Python framework for all the public APIs of Android, just because you really don't want to get into Java for all this . 

 PS: No, you can't write full fledged apps for Android, since you really don't want to get in to learn the language on which are the OS APIs.
