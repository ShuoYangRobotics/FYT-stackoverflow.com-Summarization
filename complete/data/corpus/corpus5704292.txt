Question (ID-5704292): "+=" causing syntax error in Python n = 1
p = 4
print n += p
 

 gives me: 

 
 File "p7.py", line 17 
 
 print n += p 
 
 SyntaxError: invalid syntax 
 

 How can this problem be fixed? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 n += p is a statement in Python, not an expression that returns a value you could print. This is different from a couple of other languages, for example Ruby, where everything is an expression. 

 You need to do 

 n += p
print n
 
 #1 You'll need to break it up onto separate lines: 

 n = 1
p = 4
n += p
print n
 
 #2 Assignment, including "augmented" assignment ( x op= expr as shorcut for x = x op expr ), is a statement, not an expression. So it doesn't result in a value. You can't print the result of something that doesn't result in anything - but that's what you're telling Python to do: "Evaluate n += p , then print the result of that." 

 If you want to modify n and print the new n , do that on two lines. If you just want to print the sum of n and p without modifying either, use + instead of += . 
 #3 n += p is equal to n = n + p . This is a statement on its own and cannot be printed out. You probably meant print n + p . 

 EDIT : 

 
 figured it out... somewhat. taking out the print statement makes it work. I dont understand the rule here, why it breaks with print, but Ill keep looking 
 

 I would seriously suggest to get a book about Python and learn from that. You obviously (not meant as an insult, just informing you) have no idea what you are doing. 
 #4 += is a statement. Place it on a line by itself. 
 #5 While += is generally legal Python, it is syntactically not allowed at this point, so try: 

 n = 1
p = 4
n += p
print n
