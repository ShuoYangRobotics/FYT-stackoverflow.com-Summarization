Question (ID-7343810): How to reformat a string in python? Right now I have a string in the form xxx@yyy.com@zzz.com and I want to strip off the @zzz.com so that it comes out as xxx@yyy.com . 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 You can use: 

 "xxx@yyy.com@zzz.com".replace("@zzz.com", "")
 

 If you know it will always be "@zzz.com". 

 Otherwise, you could try: 

 data = "xxx@yyy.com@zzz.com"
if data.count("@") == 2:
 data = data.rsplit('@', 1)[0]
 

 Or, more generally: 

 data = "xxx@yyy.com@zzz.com@___.com"
if data.count("@") &gt; 1:
 data = data.rsplit('@', data.count("@")-1)[0]
 

 You can learn more about the string methods I have used at Python : String Methods 
 #1 &gt;&gt;&gt; 'xxx@yyy.com@zzz.com'.rpartition('@')[0]
'xxx@yyy.com'
 
 #2 string = "xxx@yyy.com@zzz.com"
string = "@".join(string.split("@")[:2])
 

 Simple way to do the job. I don't think it's very safe though.

&gt;&gt;&gt; import re
&gt;&gt;&gt; re.sub('@[^@.]*\.com$', '', 'xxx@yyy.com@zzz.com')
'xxx@yyy.com'
 
 #4 string = "xxx@yyy.com@zzz.com"

print string[0:string.rfind('@')]

 #5 This would work. Please check it. 

 st='xxx@yyy.com@zzz.com' 
print st 
newstr=st[0:st.rfind('@')] 
print newstr
 

 Idea is to use rfind and strip find the @ symbol from the end. 
 #6 Not sure if this code is too much for the task, but here ya go. 

 data = "xxx@yyy.com@zzz.com"

def cleaner(email):
 counter = 0
 result = ''
 for i in data:
  if i == "@":
  counter += 1
  if counter == 2:
  break
  result += i
 return result

data = cleaner(data)

data = 'xxx@yyy.com'
 

 Just pass the data to the cleaner function. For example: cleaner(data) will return the correct answer. 

 edit: what gribbler posted is 1000x better than this...lol I am still learning :) 

 data.rpartition('@')[0]
