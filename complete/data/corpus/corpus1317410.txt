Question (ID-1317410): Finding matching keys in two large dictionaries and doing it fast I am trying to find corresponding keys in two different dictionaries. Each has about 600k entries. 

 Say for example: 

  myRDP = { 'Actinobacter': 'GATCGA...TCA', 'subtilus sp.': 'ATCGATT...ACT' }
 myNames = { 'Actinobacter': '8924342' }
 

 I want to print out the value for Actinobacter (8924342) since it matches a value in myRDP. 

 The following code works, but is very slow: 

  for key in myRDP:
  for jey in myNames:
   if key == jey:
    print key, myNames[key]
 

 I've tried the following but it always results in a KeyError: 

  for key in myRDP:
  print myNames[key]
 

 Is there perhaps a function implemented in C for doing this? I've googled around but nothing seems to work. 

 Thanks. 
 Answers (Total-8): #0 You could do this: 

 for key in myRDP:
 if key in myNames:
  print key, myNames[key]
 

 Your first attempt was slow because you were comparing every key in myRDP with every key in myNames. In algorithmic jargon, if myRDP has n elements and myNames has m elements, then that algorithm would take O( n Ã— m ) operations. For 600k elements each, this is 360,000,000,000 comparisons! 

 But testing whether a particular element is a key of a dictionary is fast -- in fact, this is one of the defining characteristics of dictionaries. In algorithmic terms, the key in dict test is O(1), or constant-time. So my algorithm will take O( n ) time, which is one 600,000th of the time. 
 #1 Use sets, because they have a built-in intersection method which ought to be quick: 

 myRDP = { 'Actinobacter': 'GATCGA...TCA', 'subtilus sp.': 'ATCGATT...ACT' }
myNames = { 'Actinobacter': '8924342' }

rdpSet = set(myRDP)
namesSet = set(myNames)

for name in rdpSet.intersection(namesSet):
 print name, myNames[name]

# Prints: Actinobacter 8924342
 
 #2 for key in myRDP:
 name = myNames.get(key, None)
 if name:
  print key, name
 

 dict.get returns the default value you give it (in this case, None ) if the key doesn't exist. 
 #3 You could start by finding the common keys and then iterating over them. Set operations should be fast because they are implemented in C, at least in modern versions of Python. 

 common_keys = set(myRDP).intersection(myNames)
for key in common_keys:
 print key, myNames[key]
 
 #4 Use the get method instead: 

 for key in myRDP:
 value = myNames.get(key)
 if value != None:
  print key, "=", value
 
 #5 Copy both dictionaries into one dictionary/array. This makes sense as you have 1:1 related values. Then you need only one search, no comparison loop, and can access the related value directly. 

 Example Resulting Dictionary/Array: 

 

 [Name][Value1][Value2]

[Actinobacter][GATCGA...TCA][8924342]

[XYZbacter][BCABCA...ABC][43594344]
 

 

 ... 
 #6 Here is my code for doing intersections, unions, differences, and other set operations on dictionaries: 

 class DictDiffer(object):
 """
 Calculate the difference between two dictionaries as:
 (1) items added
 (2) items removed
 (3) keys same in both but changed values
 (4) keys same in both and unchanged values
 """
 def __init__(self, current_dict, past_dict):
 	self.current_dict, self.past_dict = current_dict, past_dict
 	self.set_current, self.set_past = set(current_dict.keys()), set(past_dict.keys())
 	self.intersect = self.set_current.intersection(self.set_past)
 def added(self):
 	return self.set_current - self.intersect 
 def removed(self):
 	return self.set_past - self.intersect 
 def changed(self):
 	return set(o for o in self.intersect if self.past_dict[o] != self.current_dict[o])
 def unchanged(self):
 	return set(o for o in self.intersect if self.past_dict[o] == self.current_dict[o])

if __name__ == '__main__':
 import unittest
 class TestDictDifferNoChanged(unittest.TestCase):
 	def setUp(self):
 		self.past = dict((k, 2*k) for k in range(5))
 		self.current = dict((k, 2*k) for k in range(3,8))
 		self.d = DictDiffer(self.current, self.past)
 	def testAdded(self):
 		self.assertEqual(self.d.added(), set((5,6,7)))
 	def testRemoved(self):		
 		self.assertEqual(self.d.removed(), set((0,1,2)))
 	def testChanged(self):
 		self.assertEqual(self.d.changed(), set())
 	def testUnchanged(self):
 		self.assertEqual(self.d.unchanged(), set((3,4)))
 class TestDictDifferNoCUnchanged(unittest.TestCase):
 	def setUp(self):
 		self.past = dict((k, 2*k) for k in range(5))
 		self.current = dict((k, 2*k+1) for k in range(3,8))
 		self.d = DictDiffer(self.current, self.past)
 	def testAdded(self):
 		self.assertEqual(self.d.added(), set((5,6,7)))
 	def testRemoved(self):		
 		self.assertEqual(self.d.removed(), set((0,1,2)))
 	def testChanged(self):
 		self.assertEqual(self.d.changed(), set((3,4)))
 	def testUnchanged(self):
 		self.assertEqual(self.d.unchanged(), set())
 unittest.main()
 
 #7 If the entries are sorted, you can try a binary search algorithm . Its the fastest search method you could do here.
