Question (ID-1313694): Python style question, function parameters Which is preferred 

 def method(self):
 

 or 

 def method( self ): 
 

 With spaces in the parenthesis. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Check out PEP 8 . It says to do the first one. 
 #1 The common reference for Python style is PEP8, see: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ 

 To answer your question specifically, this is under "Pet Peeves": 

 Avoid extraneous whitespace in the following situations: 

 
 Immediately inside parentheses, brackets or braces. 

 
 Yes: spam(ham[1], {eggs: 2}) 
 No: spam( ham[ 1 ], { eggs: 2 } ) 
 
 
 #2 There's PEP 8 the Python Style Guide: 

 http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ 

 It suggests the former style, but note the introduction carefully. 

 I find the latter to be visual nails-on-chalkboard, personally.

 #4 Python Style Guide 

 No space around the inside of function signatures. Occasionally I put space inside the parens of a function call if the arguments are particularly hairy, but never on the definition. I don't think any language makes a habit of that, actually. 
 #5 I don't think you should blindly follow the PEP-8 style, like a vow upon a bible. 

 The PEP8 is intended for code that goes in the python standard library , i.e. the modules you can import just after you've installed Python, but they have very different development constraints than most of the software I write. 

 So I tend to think a lot about each "rule" (either from the PEP8 , the pylint / pychecker ones, or the Google Style Guide ) and see how it can apply to my code -- the pros and cons. 

 As for your question, people usually don't use spaces inside parentheses, although I've seen it in some code by coworkers that like it, IMHO it detracts a little from readability, but it's a minor issue.
