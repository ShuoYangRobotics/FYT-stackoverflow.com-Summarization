Question (ID-4350406): Python: the division is killing me! Heres my method: 

 def geometricSum(commonRatio,firstTerm,lastTerm):
 return ((firstTerm-lastTerm)*commonRatio)/(1-commonRatio)
 

 Interpreter testing: 

  &gt;&gt;&gt; geometricSum(1.0,1.0,100.0)
 Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;interactive input&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  File "F:\PortablePython_1.1_py3.0.1\sumOfGeometric.py", line 2, in geometricSum
   return ((firstTerm-lastTerm)*commonRatio)/(1-commonRatio)
 ZeroDivisionError: float division
 

 Lawl. So I can't divide doubles? Whats the problem here? 

 I am using PythonPortable which is using python v3.0.1 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Haha man, I'm sorry to be blunt, but this has nothing to do with doubles. You are DIVIDING BY ZERO! You could have blown up the universe if it wasn't for python's exception handling! 
 #1 You're dividing by zero. commonRatio is 1.0 so the denominator is 1-1.0 = 0. 
 #2 1 - commonRatio = 1 - 1 = 0.
 

 Division by 0 is not yet supported in python. or in math. 
 #3 Looks like your commonRatio was 1 and so you were summing a divergent series. 
 #4 with those parameters you are trying to divide by zero... 

 commonRatio = 1.0

/ (1-commonRatio)

/ 0 
 

 this throws a ZeroDivisionError exception 
 #5 Python told you what the problem is: 

 
 ZeroDivisionError: float division 
 

 Please read the error messages. It says ZeroDivisionError because there was an Error trying to perform a Division by Zero . You are dividing by 1 - commonRatio , which is zero at that point in the program.
