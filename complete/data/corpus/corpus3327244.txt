Question (ID-3327244): Facebook wall writing application I was wondering if i could possible write an app, that could be a list of all my friends and just simply posting a message to their walls on the friends i select. Not a message, a wall post. So it appears that i went to their wall and wrote a message, they have no idea that an app is pushing the message to them. 

 also could it be written in python :) its what i know. php is so icky, but doable if it is the only option. 

 Please and thank you. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Check the Python SDK for the Facebook Graph API: 

 http://github.com/facebook/python-sdk 

 In particular, you want the put_wall_post function. 

 A short python script making use of this module should fit your needs perfectly. 
 #1 Check out the Facebook API. It will more than likely show that the wall post came from your application. As far as the language you implement in, I think you could use Python. 
 #2 There are a couple of Facebook APIs that could tie in to. I'm at work and any website that makes mention of facebook is blocked so I can't provide links, but Google 'Facebook API'. 
 #3 Yes, it is possible. The facebook api supports Python via python-sdk . You would be interested in stream.publish ( link ) 
 #4 Sure, you could do this. You'll need to have a look at the docs .
You can use the Python SDK to work in Python, and the Graph API to make the posts. Have fun 
 #5 Here is below code to achieve your requirement in facebook application: (Your application should be already contain publish to wall permission. That you can find at Start up Application ) 

 update_url = "https://graph.facebook.com/&lt;Your_Friend_Facebook_ID&gt;/feed"
form_fields = {
 "access_token": "Your Access Token",
 "message" : "Your Message"
}
temp = {}
for k, v in form_fields.iteritems():
 temp[k] = unicode(v).encode('utf-8')

form_data = urllib.urlencode(temp)
res = urlfetch.fetch(url=update_url,
      payload=form_data,
      method=urlfetch.POST,
      headers={'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'})
result = json.loads(res.content)
if result.get('id', False):
 "Success"
else:
 "Failure"
