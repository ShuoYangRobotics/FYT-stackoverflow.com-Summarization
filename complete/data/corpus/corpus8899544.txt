Question (ID-8899544): Python - Add words from string list that begin with a specific char Ok, stuck on another Python Question. I have tried this a few times, but can't seem to figure it out. 

 Question: Implement a function startString( char, stringlist) that returns a list of all strings in the list that begin with the character char. 

 startString('s',["simple", "to", "do", "some","things"])
 

 This is what I have tried thus far and I know it doesn't work: 

 def startString(char, stringlist):
 newlist = []
 for i in stringlist:
  if stringlist[0] == char:
   newlist.append(stringlist)
 print newlist
 

 Thank for any help that is offered.

 You can create new lists in Python with a List Comprehension. 

 newList = [item for item in oldList] 
 You can index into Strings the same way you do lists. This is equivalent to the .startswith() method from a string. 

 firstChar = inputString[0] 
 You can use conditions in list comrpehensions to control what items show up in the new list. 

 newList = [item for item in oldList if &lt;logic test&gt;] 
 Depending on how you're being graded, remember to return the new list, not print it. If the grading is done in any way that's automated the difference will be noticeable. 
 

 Reviewing your provided sample code further, it looks like your difficulty is probably in this line: 

 if stringlist[0] == char:
 

 Here, you're retrieving the first value from the passed in list, not the first character of the string you're attempting to test. That would be enough to cause the trouble for you. Additionally, you probably don't want this line: 

 newlist.append(stringlist)
 

 That's going to put the entire input list into your output list. You probably want: 

 newlist.append(i)
 

 A lot of those details are found in other answers / suggestions as well. 
 #1 try this: 

 def startString(char, stringlist):
 newlist = []
 for string in stringlist:
  if string.startswith(char):
   newlist.append(string)
 print newlist
 
 #2 You should look at Python List Comprehensions . This "function" would normally be written in a single line with python. You also want to look at the .startswith method of strings 
 #3 The for i in stringlist iterates through your list with each element being represented as the variable i . Take a look at what you're testing within the loop and see if it's truly what you want to check. What is stringlist[0] really? 
 #4 use mystring.startswith() . Check docs 

 Then use, for example, a list comprehension using startswith to filter list items 
 #5 for i in stringlist:
 if stringlist[0] == char:
 

 The second line says that instead of looking at the first letter of one of the strings, you're just looking at the first word in the list. 
 #6 You are iterating over stringlist, but then you check, if the first element of your string list equals to char . You should change stringlist to i in your for -loop. (though it may be nicer using filter() .
