Question (ID-5599872): Python (Windows) - ImportError: No module named site I am trying to install Python for the first time. I downloaded the following installer from the Python website:
 Python 2.7.1 Windows Installer (Windows binary -- does not include source) 

 Then ran the installer, selected 'All Users' and all was fine. I installed Python into the default location:
C:\Python27 

 Next, to test that Python was installed correctly, I navigated to my Python Directory, and ran the "python" command in the windows cmd prompt. It returns me the following error: 

 ImportError: No module named site 

 I have googled, and check StackOverflow for this error, but cannot find anything! I do not know where to start looking, as I am new to python, and all I have done is ran the installer! 

 EDIT:
Here is some more debug info: 

 When I do 'python -v' I get the following: 

 
 #installing zipimport hook 
 import zipimport # builtin
 #installed zipimport hook 
 #ImportError: No module named site
 #clear builtin ._ 
 #clear sys.path
 #clear sys.argv

 #cleanup [1 ] signal

 #cleanup sys
 #cleanup builtin 
 #cleanup ints: 6 unfreed ints
 #cleanup floats 
 

 When I do dir C:\Python27\Lib\site.py* I get the following: 

 
 C:\Users\Mimminito>dir C:\Python27\Lib\site.py* 
 Volume in drive C has no label. 
 Volume Serial Number is DAB9-A863 
 
 Directory of C:\Python27\Lib

     1 File(s)   20,389 bytes 
     0 Dir(s)  694,910,976 bytes free 
 

 Any ideas?

 Answers (Total-6): #0 Hey, I've been looking into this problem for myself for almost a day and finally had a breakthrough. Try this: 

 
 Setting the PYTHONPATH / PYTHONHOME variables 

 Right click the Computer icon in the start menu, go to properties.
On the left tab, go to Advanced system settings. In the window that comes up, go to the Advanced tab, then at the bottom click Environment Variables. Click in the list of user variables and start typing Python, and repeat for System variables, just to make certain that you don't have mis-set variables for PYTHONPATH or PYTHONHOME. Next, add new variables (I did in System rather than User, although it may work for User too): PYTHONPATH, set to C:\Python27\Lib. PYTHONHOME, set to C:\Python27. 
 

 Hope this helps! 
 #1 To avoid communication errors, please edit the question to show the name of "the 2.7.1 Windows Installer" that you downloaded, the url of "the Python website", the version of Windows that you are running, the full path of your "Python Directory" (default is C:\Python27 ). 

 Did you choose the "all users" or "yourself" option? 

 Please confirm that you are running the "python" command in a "Command Prompt" window.
Please show the output when you do python -v instead of just python . 

 Try navigating to some other directory (e.g. c:\junk ) and running the command \your_python_directory\python -v ; do you get the same results? 

 What do you get when you do dir \your_python_directory\Lib\site.py* 
 #2 Make sure your PYTHONHOME environment variable is set correctly. You will receive this error if PYTHONHOME is pointing to invalid location or to another Python installation you are trying to run. 

 Try this: 

 C:\&gt;set PYTHONHOME=C:\Python27
C:\&gt;python
 
 #3 You may try the Open Source Active Python Setup which is a well done Python installer for Windows.
You just have to desinstall your version and install it... 
 #4 Are you trying to run Windows Python from Cygwin? I'm having the same problem. Python in Cygwin fails to import site. Python in Cmd works. 

 It looks like you need to make sure you run PYTHONHOME and PYTHONPATH through cygwin -aw to make them Windows paths. Also, python seems to be using some incorrect paths. 

 I think I'll need to install python through cygwin to get it working. 
 #5 Quick solution: set PYTHONHOME and PYTHONPATH and include PYTHONHOME on PATH 

 For example if you installed to c:\Python27 

 set PYTHONHOME=c:\Python27
set PYTHONPATH=c:\Python27\Lib
set PATH=%PYTHONHOME%;%PATH% 

 Make sure you don't have a trailing '\' on the PYTHON* vars, this seems to break it aswel.
