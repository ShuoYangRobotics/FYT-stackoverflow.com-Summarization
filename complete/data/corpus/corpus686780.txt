Question (ID-686780): Best resources for starting Jython I just got my first Jython (and Python) project, and I was wondering what documentation, IDEs, etc. are best suited to a Java buff like me. 

 I know there are a lot of questions about starting out with Python, so I'm asking for things that might be specific to Jython. Where should I start? If it helps, I'm running Linux and Solaris only. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 For starters, I'd read python is not java . It'll give you a good idea of some habits you may have to break to program in Python effectively. As has been mentioned, pydev is a pretty good development environment. Although I would say that you would eventually want to learn emacs (but you may just want to learn one thing at a time). 
 #1 Do you use Eclipse for Java? PyDev is a nice Eclipse plugin for Python. PyDev has full support for Jython. 
 #2 If you're using Netbeans for Java there's a nice Python plugin . 
 #3 I'm surprised no one has yet mentioned www.jython.org -- maybe that's too obvious. I also liked the book Jython Essentials from O'Reilly. The book is dated (from 2002), but I still keep it on my bookshelf. 
 #4 The Jython-users mailing list is a great resource: 
 https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/jython-users 
jython-users@lists.sourceforge.net 

 IBM Developerworks has some good articles, which I can't find on their website anymore. They are on the jython.org homepage however: 
 Part 1 
 Part 2 

 PyDev is a good IDE if you're into Eclipse 
 #5 Book: The Definitive Guide to Jython, for jython 2.5.
