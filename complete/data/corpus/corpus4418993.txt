Question (ID-4418993): Python tutorial or reference? I can already program in other programming/script languages (C/C++, C#, VB.NET, javascript, lua, ...) and I want to learn python now to use panda3D. (I know I can use C++, but I read that python is easier and faster and it will be fun to learn a new language). 

 The problem is that most of the tutorials I found on the internet are for beginners and it is kind of boring to read them because I already know how a if, while, variables, ... work. 

 The only thing I want to learn is how the language looks like. The syntax. How to define variables, how to define a class, how to initialize, how to use a library, ... 
 Answers (Total-9): #0 Since you already know how to program I'd recommend Dive Into Python . 
 #1 The the video lectures from the Google python class:
 http://code.google.com/edu/languages/google-python-class/index.html 

 Then head over to pyschools.com for some good practice. 
 #2 I found The Python Cookbook useful when I was in a similar position. It's pretty good at getting across how to "think Python" IMO. 
 #3 Lutz has a new update for Programming Python . Dive into Python is also an excellent reference as stated above. 
 #4 Learning Python might be a good start. It's a little old but the basics are mostly the same. 
 #5 Official Python tutorial:
 http://docs.python.org/tutorial/index.html 
 #6 I guess I too had the same problem and I would suggest the best way is to experiment and whenever in doubt look at the official Python docs. It is quite comprehensive for the beginners as well as for those learning Python for advanced usage.....Moreover there is a link for each function which describes its usage so I would say its the best for you.... Here's the link

 #7 Since you already know how to program in other imperative languages I'd just start with the (Python Language Reference)[http://docs.python.org/reference/index.html]. If you come across a construct that you can't understand from the reference then find the corresponding section of the tutorial . 

 After that, sections 1 - 3 of the [Library Reference](http://docs.python.org/library/index.html as well as the sections on sys , string , re , math , itertools , os , and types to start with. After that, look at any other libraries you're particularly interested in.
