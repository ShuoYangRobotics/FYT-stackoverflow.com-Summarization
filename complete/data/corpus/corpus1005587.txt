Question (ID-1005587): Gantt Chart online I need to insert a horizontal bar chart in a web page. The thing I have to do is very similar to a Gantt Chart. 

 I'd like to use a javascript library for the purpose. I tried jsgantt, but actually it is not very beautiful. 

 I could evaluate also a server generation of the graph. In case my server side language is Python. 

 It will be part of an internal project with no internet access, so Google Charts isn't an option. 
 Answers (Total-9): #0 Have a look at the flot jQuery plugin : 

 
 Flot is a pure Javascript plotting library for jQuery. It produces graphical plots of arbitrary datasets on-the-fly client-side. 
 
 The focus is on simple usage (all settings are optional), attractive looks and interactive features like zooming and mouse tracking. 
 

 The library can produce bar graphs, and is used by our host site - have a look at Stack Overflow Reputation History page. 
 #1 For me, the best is http://gantter.com/ you don't need registration process, it exports to msproject or pdf.... perfect! 
 #2 Try one of this: 

 http://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/dhtmlxGantt/index.shtml - neat chart, option to edit tasks, one serious drawback: lacks timescale change 

 http://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/dojox/gantt.html - free (!!), quite nice, but very hard to customize (unless you modify the source code) 

 http://bryntum.com/gantt/ - so far, one of my favourites - very easy to customize, but licensing for commercial projects is unclear, you can download trial for 45 days 

 http://www.tgantt.com/treegrid/www/Gantt.html - actually, this one looks like a space vessel's dashboard and so it is to configure, still struggling to put this in my application 
 #3 Have a look at http://www.ext-scheduler.com . 100% JavaScript, based on ExtJS. Disclaimer: I wrote it. 
 #4 For Gantt chart generation see: 

 
 http://www.mechanicalcat.net/tech/pytaskplan/ 
 http://www.strout.net/python/piddle/ 
 http://opensched.sourceforge.net/ 
 

 or there are general charting libs like 

 
 http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/ 
 http://home.gna.org/pychart/ 
 

 or may be just use gnuplot . 
 #5 Maybe you can get some impressions of how it could be done by these examples:

 http://www.chartle.net/ 
 http://www.lovelycharts.com/ 
 http://www.icharts.net/ 
 https://scrumy.com/ 
 http://chartgizmo.com/ 
 http://www.archimy.com/ 
 http://www.gliffy.com/ 
 

 I hope these are enough for some inspiration. 
 #6 see also Open Flash Chart 
it gives support helpers also for the most popular programming languages. 
 #7 You could use FusionWidget at http://www.fusioncharts.com/widgets/gallery.asp . It's not free, but its Gantt chart works greatly for me. 
 #8 I like this one, is still under development, "use it at your own risk" but it's very drag and drop
