Question (ID-5459896): Low volume Open source Message Board suggestions? Looking for a low volume, probably no more that 20-30 users, Open Source message/bulletin board. Obviously must be written in something which our web server supports, PHP/Python/Ruby etc. Any suggestions? 

 Thanks,
 Nick

 phpBB 
 

 and lots more. The above are designed to handle very large boards, but can be used with low traffic websites. All PHP 
 #1 PhpBB http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhpBB free and open Source, requires MySQL. Great for running on run-of-the-mill LAMP configurations. 
 #2 I would use Vanilla forums in your case. It has a great API for integrating into other projects as well. 

 Or if you prefer the more traditional forum layout see PunBB . 

 I would not recommend phpBB for a low volume forum as it is more complicated to setup and maintain. It is also a much larger app and not lightweight at all. 
 #3 PhpBB is an excellent. It's very easy to set up and has many great features, but it is more difficult to customize right out of the box. For a superfast "community" solution, try using WordPress with the BuddyPress plugin. 
 #4 I can recommend MyLittleForum. It's actually not a board, but a forum, but one of the views (with compacted threads) looks pretty much board-like. http://mylittleforum.net/forum/index.php?mode=index 
 #5 Thanks for all the suggestions. 

 However can any of these actually be integrated into our existing website rather than having to integrate our website into the BB architecture. 

 Basically I want to keep our existing website Header, Menu, QuickLinks panel, Footer (floating) etc. I want to embed the Message Forum and all its screens into a main within our existing site layout. Is this possible? 

 I have tried installing both phpBB and myBB but neither of them seem to allow full integration within our website.
