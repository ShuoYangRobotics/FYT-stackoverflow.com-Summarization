Question (ID-2304632): regex for Twitter username Could you provide a regex that match Twitter usernames? 

 Extra bonus if a Python example is provided. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 If you're talking about the @username thing they use on twitter, then you can use this: 

 import re
twitter_username_re = re.compile(r'@([A-Za-z0-9_]+)')
 

 To make every instance an HTML link, you could do something like this: 

 my_html_str = twitter_username_re.sub(lambda m: '&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/%s"&gt;%s&lt;/a&gt;' % (m.group(1), m.group(0)), my_tweet)
 
 #1 Twitter recently released to open source both java and ruby ( gem ) implementations of the code they use for finding user names, hash tags, lists and urls. 

 It is very regular expression oriented. 
 #2 The only characters accepted in the form are A-Z, 0-9, and underscore. Usernames are not case-sensitive , though, so you could use r'@(?i)[a-z0-9_]+' to match everything correctly and also discern between users. 
 #3 Shorter, /@([\w]+)/ works fine. 
 #4 (?&lt;=^|(?&lt;=[^a-zA-Z0-9-_\.]))@([A-Za-z]+[A-Za-z0-9]+)
 

 Ive used this as it disregards emails 

 Here is a sample tweet 

 @Hello how are @you doing, email @000 me @ whats.up@example.com @shahmirj
 

 Picks Up: 

 @Hello
@you
@shahmirj
 

 It will also work for hash tags, I use the same experssion with the @ changed to # 

 That's right I just sneaked myself in there :D 
 #5 Here is a PHP function that links urls and also mailto and twitter usernames and arguments tags.
