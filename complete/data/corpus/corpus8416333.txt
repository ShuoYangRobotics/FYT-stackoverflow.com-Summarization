Question (ID-8416333): Selecting a file from a stated directory in Python I want to select a file by numbers at left side of listing but I can't go more than this: 

 import os
path="/root/Desktop"
dirList=os.listdir(path)
for fname in dirList:
 print fname

selected = raw_input("Select a file above: ")
 

 What should I do? 

 Example:

 Thank you in advance.. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 You should use enumerate for the list and then handle input errors. Ideally this would be a function and instead of doing a break you would just return the selected file. 

 import os

path="/root/Desktop"
dirList=os.listdir(path)

for i, fname in enumerate(dirList):
 print "%d) %s" % (i + 1, fname)

while True:
 try:
  selectedInt = int(raw_input("Select a file above: "))
  selected = dirList[selectedInt - 1]
  break
 except Exception:
  print "Error: Please enter a number between 1 and %d" % len(dirList)
 
 #1 for i, fname in enumerate(dirList):
 print "%s) %s" % (i + 1, fname)

selectedInt = int(raw_input("Select a file above: "))
selected = dirList[selectedInt - 1]
 

 However, note that there is no error correction done. You should catch cases, where the input is no integer. 
 #2 You could try the following : 

 import os
path="/root/Desktop"
dirList=os.listdir(path)
for i in range(0,len(dirList)): # generate an index an loop over it
 print "%d)" % (i+1), dirList[i] # print a selection number matching each file

selected = raw_input("Select a file above: ")
selected = int(selected) # cast the input to int

print "You have selected:", dirList[selected-1] # you can get the corresponding entry!
 

 That should do the trick :) 
 #3 You know the filename at a specific index so you can just do something like this: 

 import os
path="/root/Desktop"
dirList=os.listdir(path)

for index in range(0,len(dirList)):
 print str(index+1) + ": " + dirList[index]

selected = raw_input("Select a file above: ")
print "You selected filename: " + dirList[selected];
 

 edit: oops to slow 
 #4 Try this: 

 import os

listed_files = []
for i, fname in enumerate(os.listdir("/root/Desktop")):
 print i, ': ', fname
 listed_files.append(fname)

selected = raw_input("Select a file above: ")
open("/root/Desktop/%s" % listed_files[int(selected)])
 
 #5 Create a dictionary where the key is an index and the value is the filename (use enumerate(dirList) to get a tuple of (index, filename) per iteration). Then just pull the corresponding value based on the input (key).
