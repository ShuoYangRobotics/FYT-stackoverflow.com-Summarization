Question (ID-2964658): installing paramiko on Windows This may sound like a repeated question on SF, but I could not find a clear answer to it, yet.So.
I installed Paramiko 1.7 with "setup.py install" command and while running the demo.py program, I got this error: 

 Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "C:\Documents and Settings\fixavier\Desktop\paramiko-1.7\demos\demo.py", line 33, in &lt;module&gt;
 import paramiko
 File "C:\Python26\lib\site-packages\paramiko\__init__.py", line 69, in &lt;module&gt;
 from transport import randpool, SecurityOptions, Transport
 File "C:\Python26\lib\site-packages\paramiko\transport.py", line 32, in &lt;module&gt;
 from paramiko import util
 File "C:\Python26\lib\site-packages\paramiko\util.py", line 31, in &lt;module&gt;
 from paramiko.common import *
 File "C:\Python26\lib\site-packages\paramiko\common.py", line 99, in &lt;module&gt;
 from Crypto.Util.randpool import PersistentRandomPool, RandomPool
ImportError: No module named Crypto.Util.randpool
 

 I'm getting this error even after installing PyCrypto 2.1.
On running test.py(which comes with the installation), I got the following error - 

  Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "C:\Documents and Settings\fixavier\Desktop\pycrypto-2.0.1\pycrypto-2.0.1\test.py", line 18, in &lt;module&gt;
 from Crypto.Util import test

 import testdata
 File "C:\Documents and Settings\fixavier\Desktop\pycrypto-2.0.1\pycrypto-2.0.1\test\testdata.py", line 450, in &lt;module&gt;
 from Crypto.Cipher import AES
ImportError: cannot import name AES
 

 I don't have the confidence to go ahead and install AES after all this, for all I know I may get another ImportError!
Please advice.Is it the way of installation thats problematic? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Looks like your pycrypto installation is broken or not installed. 

 Try to get a pycrypto for python2.6 installer here and try again after installing it. 

 
 http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/modules.shtml#pycrypto 
 
 #1 It appears that the Crypto package you downloaded doesn't have AES... 

 you should try doing the following: 

 import Crypto
import Crypto.Util
import Crypto.Cipher
 

 if any of those fail then you still need to make sure pycrypto is installed (see the link from S.Mark here ), otherwise Paramiko might not depend on having AES (even though there is a test for that) 
 #2 It seems PyCrypto uses a c-compiler(which is inherently present on the Linux system - gcc). 
Also, somewhere on the PyCrypto readme.txt file says, it needs to be 'build' first, before doing an 'install'
On Linux, I build it first and then ran 'install' command on it and was successfully installed. 
 #3 
 Download paramiko for windows. You get the zip file:
www.lag.net/paramiko/ 
 To build it you need the dependency package pycrypto. Again keep in mind you will need a matching version of pycrypto for your Python. This is a built version of Windows so no install is required. http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/modules.shtml#pycrypto 
 You could do an easy_install by downloading setuptools but I ran into some issues so I chose to download MinGW tool. This is again an installation and no build is required. http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Automated%20MinGW%20Installer/mingw-get-inst/mingw-get-inst-20110316/ 
 Once you have pycrypto and MinGW installed on your windows machine, just browse to the folder where you extracted the paramiko module from the zip file and issue this command:
python setup.py build --compiler=mingw32 bdist_wininst
TADA! You are all set to use ssh on your windows machine with Python. 
 
 #4 I tried Vijay's method,but it doesn't work.
I use the method on 'http://kmdarshan.com/blog/?p=3208',it works:
1) Goto to http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Downloads and download the pycrypto package .exe for windows/python2.5. This is needed for running paramiko. 

 2) Next, download the paramiko package from http://www.lag.net/paramiko/ . 

 3) Unzip paramiko to a temporary folder, better if you unzip it to the folder where python is installed. 

 4) Go into the folder for paramiko. 

 5) Open command prompt and see to it that you have python set as the environment variable. 

 6) Run this command python setup.py install 

 7) You will get a series of lines of compilation. Just make sure you dont have any error in them. If you have any errors you will need to re compile them again. 

 8) Just be be sure everything is alright import paramiko in your program and see. 

 9) FYI: paramiko is used for ssh..and so on. 
 #5 I searched for a long time looking for a solution to this problem. I'm running Windows 7 64-bit and python 2.7. None of the above solutions worked for me. 

 this one did 

 Don't forget to include the C++ compiler when you download the Microsoft SDK, it wasn't checked by default. 

 I downloaded the pycrypto 2.5 source to do the compile and the paramiko 2.3, things work well.
