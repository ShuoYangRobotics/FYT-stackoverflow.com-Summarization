Question (ID-2690723): Facebook Graph API and Django I am curious if there is any article/ library / anything useful that is built for the newly announced Facebook Graph API. I am planning to use it for a Python/Django project. 
 Answers (Total-8): #0 since it looks to me as something simple as calling an URL and deserializing the result (JSON), this should be only a few lines: 

 from urllib2 import urlopen
from simplejson import loads
content = loads(urlopen('http://graph.facebook.com/2439131959').read())
 

 content is now a dictionary with all the info: 

 {'category': u'Just for fun',
 'description': "Graffiti lets you draw on your friends' profiles.",
 'id': '2439131959',
 'name': 'Graffiti'}
 
 #1 There is also this: http://github.com/facebook/python-sdk 
 #2 Just in case anyone is still looking for a Python implementation of the Facebook Graph API that's usable with Django, I recommend https://github.com/egnity/fb.py . The good thing about this one is that not only does it support the new Graph API (which PyFacebook doesn't), it also supports some of the functionality that's not available in python-sdk but was available through the old REST API eg. getting mutual friends. Got my Django-based Facebook app up and running in no time. 
 #3 It seems that there's more mature fork of the project to which dar linked here: 

 http://github.com/dickeytk/django_facebook_oauth 

 Documentation is missing few things but it shouldn't that hard to implement. 
 #4 In Python file use following code: 

  args = dict(client_id=&lt;Facebook_Application_Id&gt;, redirect_uri=&lt;Your_domain_path_url&gt;) # self.request.path_url
 if self.request.get("code"):
  args["client_secret"] = &lt;Facebook Secret Key&gt;
  args["code"] = self.request.get("code")
  response = cgi.parse_qs(urllib.urlopen(
   "https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/access_token?" + 
   urllib.urlencode(args)).read())
  access_token = response["access_token"][-1] if "access_token" in response else False

  # Download the user profile and cache a local instance of the
  # basic profile info
  profile = json.load(urllib.urlopen(
    "https://graph.facebook.com/me?" + 
    urllib.urlencode(dict(access_token=access_token))))
  User(key_name=str(profile["id"]), id=str(profile["id"]),
      name=profile["name"]).put()
  self.redirect("http://apps.facebook.com/&lt;Facebook Application urlid&gt;/")
  return
 else:
  args["scope"] = 'publish_stream'
  vals['redurl'] = 'https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/authorize?' + urllib.urlencode(args)
 

 And in Client Side use below code (Which will check for the permission and redirect to permission page if not already provided): 

 (function() {
 var e = document.createElement('script');
 e.async = true;
 e.src = document.location.protocol + '//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js';
 document.getElementById('fb-root').appendChild(e);
}());

window.fbAsyncInit = function() {
 FB.init( {
   appId : &lt;Facebook Application ID&gt;,
   status : true,
   cookie : true,
   xfbml : true
 });
 if (redurl != '') {
   FB.getLoginStatus(function(response) {
     if (!response.session || !response.perms) {
       top.location = redurl;
     }
   }, {
     perms : 'publish_stream'
   });
 }};
 

 Hope this will help you in making your own python application... :) 
 #5 You're in good company. 

 This is the only thing I've found so far http://github.com/digvan/django_facebook_oauth 
 #6 I think you'd like Facepy : 

 from facepy import GraphAPI

# Initialize the Graph API with a valid access token (optional,
# but will allow you to do all sorts of fun stuff).
graph = GraphAPI(oauth_access_token)

# Get my latest posts
graph.get('me/posts')

# Post a photo of a parrot
graph.post(
 path = 'me/photos',
 source = open('parrot.jpg')
)
