Question (ID-4617251): Learning Python I am going to need to learn advanced Python and must be good at it in about a year, Are there any books, recommendations. I am already very familiar with PHP, MySQL, JS + HTML, and know a bit of java and C (arduino programming). 

 Thanks,

 Answers (Total-6): #0 Since you sound like a competent programmer, the best place to start may be the official Python 2.7 Tutorial . It's very thorough, certainly. 

 After that, I advise looking up through the language reference and standard library reference (the stdlib for Python is pretty massive) to get everything else. 
 #1 There are a lot of good resources, either at the python wiki , or here at previous similar questions. 

 Generally I would recommend starting with the official python tutorial . Alternatively, you might want to check other tutorials , aimed for people with previous programming experience. 

 Afterwards, you can try books, such as ' Dive Into Python ', but I always preferred sharpening my skills by trying a set of problems, such as python challenge and Project Euler . 

 I think that trying to solve such problems is a good advice for every programmer who's trying to learn a new language. 
 #2 take a look at Mark Lutz's book.. 

 it's more than an introduction, but it's not very thorough

 once you finished that one, if you found it useful you might want to pass at:

 another interesting one is the Python Cookbook 

 http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596001674 (careful, it's 6 years old) 

 the official tutorials are very useful, too ;) 
 #3 It's not a book, but I found the Google Python Class very useful. There's video, reading material, and practice questions that I found very useful. 
 #4 I have good books, but I don't know exactly what do you want (CGI's, XML manipulation, ..).
A nice way to start your study is with this book: Apress Beginning Python From Novice to Professional.
After you see the examples and the simple structures, I suggest you to look the oficial site: http://www.python.org/ and the HOWTO examples: http://docs.python.org/dev/howto/index.html 
 #5 It looks like there are a lot of good books being recommended. Be aware that there are two main versions of Python in circulation. 3.0 is the new, and a lot of 2.7 programs won't work with 3.0. Some of the syntax has been tidied up - and one of the most common problems is "print" which now has a syntax more consistent with the rest of the language. 

 As with any language, the best way to learn it is to start using it. Choose a project which pulls to Python's strengths (eg. text processing and data structures) and your probable needs in 12 months time, and start coding!
