Question (ID-677811): Python and MySQL: is there an alternative to MySQLdb? Is there a module written purely in Python that will allow a script to communicate with a MySQL database? I've already tried MySQLdb without success. It requires too much: GCC, zlib, and openssl. I do not have access to these tools; even if I did, I don't want to waste time getting them to work together. I'm looking for tools that will make my work easier. 

 Can someone point me in the direction of a MySQL Python module written in Python? If not, tips on writing my own code for communicating with MySQL would be appreciated. 

 Thanks, 

 Tony 
 Answers (Total-8): #0 There's a project at Sun to implement 100% python mysql driver.

 I haven't found any code for it though. But according to a blog comment , it's more than vaporware. 
 #1 Lately there is also oursql ( docs ), which has various advantages over MySQLdb and other existing drivers -- listed at the top of the documentation. 
 #2 You can find pre-built binary packages for MySQLdb and its dependencies for most operating systems. 

 http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=22307&amp;package_id=15775 

 What platform are you running on? 
 #3 You've looked at these?

 #4 Thanks everyone for your answers. Since I'm working with a small database (a few hundred records, mainly names and addresses) I've decided to use SQLite. I just discovered it. It seems to be perfectly suited for my purposes; it was simple to install (took about two minutes) and works well with Python. I'm stuck with Python 2.4 so I can't use the sqlite3 module, but I'm able to communicate with the database by using Python's 'subprocess.Popen' function and command-line parameters. 
 #5 Without a doubt MySQLdb is the best solution, but if you can't use itâ€¦ 

 If you have libmysqlclient .[ so | dll ], you could access it directly using ctypes module. 
 #6 As mentioned in earlier answer, MySQL Connector/Python implements the MySQL Server/Client completely in Python. No compiling, just installing. 

 Here are the links: 
* https://launchpad.net/myconnpy 
* code: https://code.launchpad.net/myconnpy 
* download: https://launchpad.net/myconnpy/+download (development shapshots) 

 It's not complete yet, but it should have enough to keep you going.

 #7 As far as I know there is no direct alternative. The only thing I can think of is to use ODBC instead, via pyodbc . The MySQL site has an ODBC connector you can download . But I've never used this approach myself, so I can't say how well it will work.
