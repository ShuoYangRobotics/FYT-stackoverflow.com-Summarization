Question (ID-394039): Which Python GUI framework? I am a newbie at Python. I see a few GUIs listed in the Python wiki but I would like to know what you think is the easiest to use. I have 2 requirements 

 
 Have buttons, tabs and a textbox 
 Be able to load an image in memory/from the web (I am using pyCURL to download the
temp image(s)) 
 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 I believe that wxPython is your best option. The GUI that comes with the Python standard library ( Tkinter ) is pretty nice, but doesn't support tabs out of the box. There's an extension called Tix which does, but it is a cross-language library which is well documented for Tcl and poorly documented for Python . 

 I've been using wxPython recently and have been very impressed. It's easy to use, is extremely well documented for both Python and C++, and supports your requirements. 
 #1 http://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt 

 Qt used with C++ is very nice, but I cannot say what PyQT is like since I never used it. 
 #2 Well, if we are voting, I would vote for PyGTK . It has the 

 
 best API, 
 fantastic documentation and tutorials, 
 a number of helper libraries, 
 a thriving community, 
 Glade user interface designing (edit: nosklo) 
 and not too hard for beginners. 
 
 #3 PyQT. Here is a small tutorial . 
 #4 I already answered here + under Wx you have something called XRC which is very similar to Glade. 
 #5 I use wxPython quite a bit for my GUI needs; the simplest reason for me is that I've found it much easier to distribute wxPython apps than PyQt apps. (Additionally, Traits are better supported under wxPython that Qt, but that is changing.) That being said, XRC and Boa Constructor and Glade (which can also build wxPython GUIs with wxGlade ) are all way, way behind Qt designer in sophistication and reliability. 

 So, because I was willing to spend a bit of time writing the layout code, etc, and because I had to distribute to several platforms, I went with wxPython. But if you have a more controlled deployment environment and you want to design graphically, PyQt might be a better fit. 
 #6 It would depend on your background as a programmer. If you're used to functional programming, I would go with Tkinter. If you're used to event-based programming, I would use wxPython.
