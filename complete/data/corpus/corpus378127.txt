Question (ID-378127): pyc to py files I wrote a lot of important python code for my project.
unfortunately, I ran sed with wrong options and lost my files :( 
In repo these files are very old, but I have the pyc files. 

 How can I convert pyc files to py? 

 Thanks!

 For the love of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, start using version control! 

 Seriously, don't ever ever ever let this happen again. You should be using source control and some form of regular backups on every last line of code that you write. 

 There are a thousand good VCS's out there, hell just search stackoverflow for options. Bazaar is a good example of one that is easy-as-pie to use. Back it up to a portable hard drive, another PC, or use Dropbox for automatic backups.

 #2 http://www.crazy-compilers.com/decompyle/ 

 There is still the package on Debian and friends (called decompyle) of the standalone software (ie, no need to send your pyc files), but it probably won't decompile 2.6 (or earlier). 
 #3 A quick search found a tool at http://byteplay.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/byteplay.py .
 http://wiki.python.org/moin/ByteplayDoc has docs. 

 I also saw http://www.depython.net/ and it looks really easy to use. 
 #4 you can use depython.com online service. http://depython.com is a new alternative online decompiling tool for Python pyc files. It does not have file size limit. 
 #5 Use a VCS, and use it wisely. Which means "commit early, commit often". You get backups as free bonus.
