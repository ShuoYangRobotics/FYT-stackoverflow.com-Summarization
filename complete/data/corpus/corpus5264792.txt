Question (ID-5264792): Python Adventure Game -> Chose A or B in a while loop not working! I'm trying to create a simple adventure game in Python. I've come to a point where I need to ask the user if they wish to choose option A or B and am using a while loop to try and do this: 

 AB = input("A or B?")

while AB != "A" or "a" or "B" or "b":
 input("Choose either A or B")

if AB == "A" or "a":
 print("A")
elif AB == "B" or "b":
 print("B")
 

 The thing is, no matter what you input, the question "Choose either A or B" comes up. What am I doing wrong? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Your while statement is evaluating on the conditionals or , which is always true for the strings you provided. 

 while AB != "A" or "a" or "B" or "b":
 

 means: 

 while (AB != "A") or "a" or "B" or "b":
 

 Non-empty strings are always True, so writing or "B" will always be true, and will always ask for input. Better to write: 

 while AB.lower() not in ('a','b'):
 
 #1 AB != "A" or "a" or "B" or "b" 
should be
 AB.upper() not in ('A','B') 
 #2 AB != "A" or "a" or "B" or "b"
 

 is interpreted as 

 (AB != "A") or ("a") or ("B") or ("b")
 

 and since "a" is always true , the result of this check will always be true . 
 #3 It would be better to use: 

 AB = raw_input("A or B?").upper()
 

 and then the not in construct as others have suggested. 
 #4 Use the raw_input() function, instead, like this: 

 ab = raw_input('Choose either A or B &gt; ')
while ab.lower() not in ('a', 'b'):
 ab = raw_input('Choose either A or B &gt; ')
 

 input() expects a Python expression as input; according to the Python documentation, it is equivalent to eval(raw_input(prompt)) . Just use raw_input() , along with the other suggestions posted here. 
 #5 try:
 inp = raw_input # Python 2.x
except NameError:
 inp = input  # Python 3.x

def chooseOneOf(msg, options, prompt=': '):
 if prompt:
  msg += prompt
 options = set([str(opt).lower() for opt in options])
 while True:
  i = inp(msg).strip().lower()
  if i in options:
   return i

ab = chooseOneOf('Choose either A or B', "ab")

lr = chooseOneOf('Left or right', ('left','right'))
