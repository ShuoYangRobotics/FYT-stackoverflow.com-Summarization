Question (ID-434580): For Python support, what company would be best to get hosting from? I want to be able to run WSGI apps but my current hosting restricts it. Does anybody know a company that can accommodate my requirements? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 My automatic response would be WebFaction . 

 I haven't personally hosted with them, but they are primarily Python-oriented (founded by the guy who wrote CherryPy, for example, and as far as I know they were the first to roll out Python 3.0 support ). 
 #1 I am a big fan of Slicehost -- you get root access to a virtual server that takes about 2 minutes to install from stock OS images. The 256m slice, which has been enough for me, is US$20/mo -- it is cheaper than keeping an old box plugged in, and easy to back up. Very easy to recommend. 
 #2 I have been using WebFaction for years and very happy with the service. They are not only python oriented. You should be able to run anything within the limitations of shared hosting (unless of course you have a dedicated server). 

 They are probably not the cheapest hosting service though. I don't know the prices. But I can still remember very well my previous hosting provider was unreachable for a week (not their servers, I mean the people). 
 #3 I've been pretty happy with Dreamhost, and of course Google AppEngine. 
 #4 Google App engine and OpenHosting.com 

 Have virtual server by OpenHosting, they are ultra fast with support and have very high uptime. 
 #5 Check out http://pythonplugged.com/ 

 They are trying to collect information on Python hosting providers using variuos technologies (CGI, FCGI, mod_python, mod_wsgi, etc)
