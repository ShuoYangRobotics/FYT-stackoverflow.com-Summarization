Question (ID-7869589): Which Python user interface library can I use for 2D games? I want to create a 2D game on Python with heavy user interface: windows, buttons, text input, etc. So far I've been using PyGame for a few simple games. 

 The game is a 2D MUD, with the standard rendering loop to draw stuff on the screen. I need the user interface to interact with the game entities like sales, blacksmith, etc. 

 I am looking for something like a mix of Pygame and wxPython/pyQT/pyGTK. 

 Which libraries can I use? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 I would take PyQT with QGraphicsView or QGraphicsScene .
Sadly there isnÂ´t a Clanlib python binding like for perl and ruby . That would be, probably, the ideal choice. 
 #1 You can use the popular Pyglet game library along with wxPython , the cross platform GUI library. An example of how to do this: 

 http://pyglet.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/experimental/wxtest.py 

 Additionally, if you want to use pure Pyglet, you can use Kytten , a pure Python GUI library built on the top of Pyglet. 
 #2 Not sure if it fits your use, but PGU is fit for pygame because it lets you use your own render loop, and tie into it. 
 #3 http://code.google.com/p/librpg/ maybe what you need 
 #4 tkinter is one choice. It has a canvas widget that is very easy to use -- you can draw objects (lines, circles, etc) as well as embed images (for tiles, for example). And of course it comes with a standard collection of widgets (buttons, comboboxes, listboxes, menus, etc) that can either be embedded in a canvas or used in the more traditional sense. 
 #5 Take a look at librocket . It supports python scripting as well..
