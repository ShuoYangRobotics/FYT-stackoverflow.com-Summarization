 Answers (Total-6): #0 Do you want to have: aList[0] ? 

 EDIT:: 
Oh, you have a tuple with the list in it!
Now I see: 

 al = ["camilla_farnestam@hotmail.com : martin00", ""],
#type(al) == tuple
#len(al) == 1
aList = al[0]
#type(aList) == list
#len(aList) == 2
#Now you can type:
aList[0]
#and you get:
"camilla_farnestam@hotmail.com : martin00"
 

 You can use aList[0].replace(' : ', ':') if you wish to remove spaces before and after colon, suit your needs.
I think that the most confusing thing here is the coma ending the first line. It creates a new tuple, that contains your list. 
 #1 al = ["camilla_farnestam@hotmail.com : martin00", ""],
print al[0][0].replace(" : ", ":")
 
 #2 comma at the end means that list is first member of a tuple, but to your question: 

 in_list = ["camilla_farnestam@hotmail.com : martin00", ""]
result = ''.join(in_list[0].split(' '))
 
 #3 Exactly.

 #4 Abgan, is probably correct, although if you still want a list, ie., 

 ["camilla_farnestam@hotmail.com : martin00"]
 

 you'd want: 

 the_list[:1]
 
 #5 lists can be accessed by index or sliced into smaller lists.
