Question (ID-724547): Graphics module for Python I'm pretty new to Python, and I'm looking for a good graphics module, especially to draw histograms, pie charts and stuff like that. What would you recommend to me? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Matplotlib is the standard for scientific data plotting. You can check out the gallery and see if it's the sort of stuff you're looking for. 
 #1 PyChart &mdash; http://home.gna.org/pychart/ 
CairoPlot &mdash; http://linil.wordpress.com/2008/09/16/cairoplot-11/ 
 #2 PyCha is pretty straightforward if you're just after the basic chart types. 
 #3 I have never used this, but there is Python interface to gnuplot , http://gnuplot-py.sourceforge.net/ 
 #4 The best out there is, IMHO, Matplotlib , but wxWidgets also has a simple plot module if that's what you're using as a GUI. 
 #5 For completeness, if you want to simply manipulate images, you can use the Python Imaging Library (PIL) .
