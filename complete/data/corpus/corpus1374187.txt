Question (ID-1374187): On a Mac w/ Python2.6 and trying to install psycopg2 I am new to Python. I have Python2.6 running now. I am following the Tutorial on the Python site. My question is when I try to follow the instructions here: 

 http://py-psycopg.darwinports.com/ 

 I get something like... 

 sudo port install py-psycopg
... bunch of errors here...
Error: The following dependencies failed to build: py-mx python24
 

 I am running MacOS X 10.4. 

 How do i make this work? 

 Any reply would be greatly appreciated. 

 UPDATE: 

 After running the code below I get the errors below: 

 $ sudo port install py26-psycopg2

 FYI, the python i installed was the dmg file from the pythong site.

 Answers (Total-6): #0 If you're using Python 2.6, you actually want to build py26-psycopg2 : 

 $ sudo port install py26-psycopg2
 

 In MacPorts, py-* packages build using Python 2.4, py25-* using Python 2.5, and py26-* use Python 2.6. 
 #1 Maybe you need to look at the version for Python 2.6 ? 
 #2 I had problems installing psycopg2 on my 10.4 Mac too. I installed both Python and Postgres from dmg files, and sudo easy_install psycopg2 was giving an error I can't remember now. What worked for me was an easy solution: 

 PATH=$PATH:/Library/PostgreSQL/8.3/bin/ sudo easy_install psycopg2
 

 which I've found at http://blog.jonypawks.net/2008/06/20/installing-psycopg2-on-os-x/ 
 #3 I installed psycopg2 on my Mac with setuptools and easy_install. First get the Python 2.6 egg from the setuptools downloads page , then install it with the instructions on that page. Then you can run the following to install it: 

 sudo easy_install psycopg2
 

 You may have different luck, but that's what did it for me. 
 #4 I did this:

 #5 I tried everything and nothing works. At least this post: 
 http://benkreeger.com/post/312303245/conquering-symbol-not-found-pqbackendpid 

 led me to homebrew which made it perfectly.
