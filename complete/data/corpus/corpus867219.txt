Question (ID-867219): Python Class Members Initialization I have just recently battled a bug in Python. It was one of those silly newbie bugs, but it got me thinking about the mechanisms of Python (I'm a long time C++ programmer, new to Python). I will lay out the buggy code and explain what I did to fix it, and then I have a couple of questions... 

 The scenario: I have a class called A, that has a dictionary data member, following is its code (this is simplification of course): 

 class A:
 dict1={}

 def add_stuff_to_1(self, k, v):
 	self.dict1[k]=v

 def print_stuff(self):
 	print(self.dict1)
 

 The class using this code is class B: 

 class B:

 def do_something_with_a1(self):
 	a_instance = A()
 	a_instance.print_stuff() 		
 	a_instance.add_stuff_to_1('a', 1)
 	a_instance.add_stuff_to_1('b', 2) 
 	a_instance.print_stuff()

 def do_something_with_a2(self):
 	a_instance = A() 
 	a_instance.print_stuff() 		
 	a_instance.add_stuff_to_1('c', 1)
 	a_instance.add_stuff_to_1('d', 2) 
 	a_instance.print_stuff()

 def do_something_with_a3(self):
 	a_instance = A() 
 	a_instance.print_stuff() 		
 	a_instance.add_stuff_to_1('e', 1)
 	a_instance.add_stuff_to_1('f', 2) 
 	a_instance.print_stuff()

 def __init__(self):
 	self.do_something_with_a1()
 	print("---")
 	self.do_something_with_a2()
 	print("---")
 	self.do_something_with_a3()
 

 Notice that every call to do_something_with_aX() initializes a new "clean" instance of class A, and prints the dictionary before and after the addition. 

 The bug (in case you haven't figured it out yet): 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; b_instance = B()
{}
{'a': 1, 'b': 2}
---
{'a': 1, 'b': 2}
{'a': 1, 'c': 1, 'b': 2, 'd': 2}
---
{'a': 1, 'c': 1, 'b': 2, 'd': 2}
{'a': 1, 'c': 1, 'b': 2, 'e': 1, 'd': 2, 'f': 2}
 

 In the second initialization of class A, the dictionaries are not empty, but start with the contents of the last initialization, and so forth. I expected them to start "fresh". 

 What solves this "bug" is obviously adding: 

 self.dict1 = {}
 

 In the __init__ constructor of class A. However, that made me wonder: 

 
 What is the meaning of the "dict1 = {}" initialization at the point of dict1's declaration (first line in class A)? It is meaningless? 
 What's the mechanism of instantiation that causes copying the reference from the last initialization? 
 If I add "self.dict1 = {}" in the constructor (or any other data member), how does it not affect the dictionary member of previously initialized instances? 
 

 

 EDIT: Following the answers I now understand that by declaring a data member and not referring to it in the __init__ or somewhere else as self.dict1, I'm practically defining what's called in C++/Java a static data member. By calling it self.dict1 I'm making it "instance-bound". 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 What you keep referring to as a bug is the documented , standard behavior of Python classes. 

 Declaring a dict outside of __init__ as you initially did is declaring a class-level variable. It is only created once at first, whenever you create new objects it will reuse this same dict. To create instance variables, you declare them with self in __init__ ; its as simple as that. 
 #1 @Matthew : Please review the difference between a class member and an object member in Object Oriented Programming. This problem happens because of the declaration of the original dict makes it a class member, and not an object member (as was the original poster's intent.) Consequently, it exists once for (is shared accross) all instances of the class (ie once for the class itself, as a member of the class object itself) so the behaviour is perfectly correct. 
 #2 When you access attribute of instance, say, self.foo, python will first find 'foo' in self.__dict__ . If not found, python will find 'foo' in TheClass.__dict__ 

 In your case, dict1 is of class A, not instance. 
 #3 Pythons class declarations are executed as a code block and any local variable definitions (of which function definitions are a special kind of) are stored in the constructed class instance. Due to the way attribute look up works in Python, if an attribute is not found on the instance the value on the class is used. 

 The is an interesting article about the class syntax on the history of Python blog. 
 #4 If this is your code: 

 class ClassA:
 dict1 = {}
a = ClassA()
 

 Then you probably expected this to happen inside Python: 

 class ClassA:
 __defaults__['dict1'] = {}

a = instance(ClassA)
# a bit of pseudo-code here:
for name, value in ClassA.__defaults__:
 a.&lt;name&gt; = value
 

 As far as I can tell, that is what happens, except that a dict has its pointer copied, instead of the value, which is the default behaviour everywhere in Python. Look at this code: 

 a = {}
b = a
a['foo'] = 'bar'
print b
 
 #5 I'm going to bring the word "bug" back into the picture. 

 I'm writing a python script for the graphics application Blender, where each instance of my class is a wall of a building. Each wall class has a list of features (doors, windows and the end of the wall). All the instances of the wall class share the same ends of the wall. 

 I know I'm new to this particular language, so I might not know intra-cut details, however the lists inside the instance of a class should be just in that class and not shared with other instances. 

 So I'm going to be the one to say the word, bug, bug, bug!!!!!!!!
