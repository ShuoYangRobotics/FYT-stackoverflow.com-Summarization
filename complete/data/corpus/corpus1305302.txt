Question (ID-1305302): Python - If statement I keep getting invalid syntax with the below: 

 if (row[0] == year) and (row[1] == month) and (row[2] == day and (row[3] == hour) and (row[4] == minute):
  	print "hello"
  else:
  	print "hello2"
 

 Any ideas? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 If "row" is a list, you can do this instead (for clarity): 

 if row[:5] == [year, month, day, hour, minute]:
 

 ..or if row is a tuple: 

 if row[:5] == (year, month, day, hour, minute):
 
 #1 A closing paren is missing at row[2] == day . 
 #2 You're missing a closing parenthesis: 

 if (row[0] == year) and (row[1] == month) and (row[2] == day and (row[3] == hour) and (row[4] == minute):
               ^^^
 

 Also, beware indentation. 
 #3 Try: 

 if row[0:5] == [year, month, day, hour, minute]:
 

 That fixes your error and makes the whole thing much more readable. 
 #4 You have 5 superfluous left parentheses but only 4 superfluous right parentheses. Consider losing ALL the parentheses! 
 #5 Add a colon after "hour)" along with the aforementioned ")"
