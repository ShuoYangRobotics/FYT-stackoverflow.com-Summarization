Question (ID-606350): How can I debug a regular expression in python? Is there a way to debug a regular expression in Python? And I'm not referring to the process of trying and trying till they work :) 

 EDIT: here is how regexes can be debugged in perl : 

 
use re 'debug';

my $str = "GET http://some-site.com HTTP/1.1";
if($str =~/get\s+(\S+)/i) {
 print "MATCH:$1\n";
}
 

 The code above produces the following output on my computer when ran : 

 
Compiling REx "get\s+(\S+)"
Final program:
 1: EXACTF (3)
 3: PLUS (5)
 4: SPACE (0)
 5: OPEN1 (7)
 7: PLUS (9)
 8:  NSPACE (0)
 9: CLOSE1 (11)
 11: END (0)
stclass EXACTF minlen 5
Matching REx "get\s+(\S+)" against "GET http://some-site.com HTTP/1.1"
Matching stclass EXACTF against "GET http://some-site.com HTTP/1.1" (33 chars)
 0   | 1:EXACTF (3)
 3  | 3:PLUS(5)
         SPACE can match 1 times out of 2147483647...
 4  | 5: OPEN1(7)
 4  | 7: PLUS(9)
         NSPACE can match 20 times out of 2147483647...
 24  | 9: CLOSE1(11)
 24  | 11: END(0)
Match successful!
MATCH:http://some-site.com
Freeing REx: "get\s+(\S+)"

 #1 Why don't you use some regEx tool (i usually use Regulator ) and test the regex-expression there and when you are satisfied, just copy/paste it into your code. 
 #2 Similar to the already mentioned, there is also Regexbuddy 
 #3 Not sure about doing such a thing directly in Python, but I could definitely suggest using a RegEx editor tool. That's likely to be your best bet anyway. Personally, I've used The Regulator and found it to very helpful. Some others are listed in this SO thread . 
 #4 I quite often use RegexPal for quick checks (an online regular expression prototyper). It has a lot of the common expressions listed along with a simple expression. Very handy when you don't have a dedicated tool and just need a quick way to work out a somple regex. 
 #5 What RegexBuddy has that the other tools don't have is a built-in debugger that shows you the entire matching process of both successful and failed match attempts. The other tools only show the final result (which RegexBuddy can show too).
