Question (ID-1209800): difference between two strings in python/php I'm looking for an easy way to compare two similar strings and output the difference
for instance if I have 

 "abcdefghijklmnop"
and
"abcdefghi" 

 the function would output 

 "jklmnop" 

 I need to know how to do this in both php and python 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 Python has the difflib module in its standard library that can be used to do this. 

 import difflib

s1 = "abcdefghijklmnop"
s2 = "abcdefghi"
s = difflib.SequenceMatcher(s1, s2)
for block in s.get_matching_blocks():
 print "match of length %d at a[%d] and b[%d]" % block
 

 difflib is very powerful and has many different ways of searching for differences. Some study of the documentation would be worthwhile if you choose to use this. 
 #1 In PHP. array_diff compares the first against the second array and returns the difference. 

 $a1 = str_split('abcdefghijklmnop');
$a2 = str_split('abcdefghi');

echo join('', array_diff($a1, $a2)); // jklmnop
 

 This will work as well. 

 $s1 = 'abcdefghijklmnop';
$s2 = 'abcdefghi';

echo str_replace(str_split($s2), '', $s1); // jklmnop
 

 This could handle $s2 = 'ghiabcdef'; as well because str_replace() is fed with an array, not a string. 
 #2 In Python, you can do: 

 x = "abcdefghijklmnop"
y = x.replace("abcdefghi", "")

# y now equals "jklmnop"
 
 #3 If you are sure that first string always starts with second string, you can do by this way: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; s1 = "abcdefghijklmnop"
&gt;&gt;&gt; s2 = "abcdefghi"
&gt;&gt;&gt; s1[len(s2):]
'jklmnop'
 
 #4 In Python: 

 string1 = "abcdefghijklmnop"
string2 = "abcdefghi"

def stringComp(string1, string2):
 if len(string1.split(string2)) &gt; 0:
 if string1 == string1.split(string2)[0]:
 	finalstring = stringComp(string2, string1)
 else:
 	finalstring = ''.join(string1.split(string2))
 else:
  finalstring = ""
 return finalstring
 

 This should always give you the difference in the strings. However, I'm sure there is a much easier way to do this. 
 #5 &gt;&gt;&gt; s1 = "abcdefghijklmnop"
&gt;&gt;&gt; s2 = "abcdefghi"
&gt;&gt;&gt; s1.strip(s2)
'jklmnop'
 
 #6 In Python: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; s1 = 'abcdefghijklmnop'
&gt;&gt;&gt; s2 = 'abcdefghi'
&gt;&gt;&gt; set(s1) - set(s2)
set(['k', 'j', 'm', 'l', 'o', 'n', 'p'])
