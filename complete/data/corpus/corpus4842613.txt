Question (ID-4842613): Merge lists that share common elements My input is a list of lists. Some of them share common elements, eg. 

 l = [['a','b','c'],['b','d','e'],['k'],['o','p'],['e','f'],['p','a'],['d','g']]
 

 I need to merge all lists, that share a common element, and repeat this procedure as long as there are no more lists with the same item. I thought about using boolean operations and a while loop, but couldn't come up with a good solution. 

 The final result should be: 

 l = [['a','b','c','d','e','f','g','o','p'],['k']] 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Algorithm: 

 
 take first set A from list 
 for each other set B in the list do if B has common element(s) with A join B into A; remove B from list 
 repeat 2. until no more overlap with A 
 put A into outpup 
 repeat 1. with rest of list 
 

 So you might want to use sets instead of list. The following program should do it. 

 l = [['a', 'b', 'c'], ['b', 'd', 'e'], ['k'], ['o', 'p'], ['e', 'f'], ['p', 'a'], ['d', 'g']]

out = []
while len(l)&gt;0:
 first, *rest = l
 first = set(first)

 lf = -1
 while len(first)&gt;lf:
  lf = len(first)

  rest2 = []
  for r in rest:
   if len(first.intersection(set(r)))&gt;0:
    first |= set(r)
   else:
    rest2.append(r)  
  rest = rest2

 out.append(first)
 l = rest

print(out)
 
 #1 I think this can be solved by modelling the problem as a graph . Each sublist is a node and shares an edge with another node only if the two sublists have some element in common. Thus, a merged sublist is basically a connected component in the graph. Merging all of them is simply a matter of finding all connected components and listing them. 

 This can be done by a simple traversal over the graph. Both BFS and DFS can be used, but I'm using DFS here since it is somewhat shorter for me. 

 l = [['a','b','c'],['b','d','e'],['k'],['o','p'],['e','f'],['p','a'],['d','g']]
taken=[False]*len(l)
l=map(set,l)

def dfs(node,index):
 taken[index]=True
 ret=node
 for i,item in enumerate(l):
  if not taken[i] and not ret.isdisjoint(item):
   ret.update(dfs(item,i))
 return ret

def merge_all():
 ret=[]
 for i,node in enumerate(l):
  if not taken[i]:
   ret.append(list(dfs(node,i)))
 return ret

print merge_all()
 
 #2 You can see your list as a notation for a Graph, ie ['a','b','c'] is a graph with 3 nodes connected to each other. The problem you are trying to solve is finding connected components in this graph . 

 You can use NetworkX for this, which has the advantage that it's pretty much guaranteed to be correct: 

 l = [['a','b','c'],['b','d','e'],['k'],['o','p'],['e','f'],['p','a'],['d','g']]

import networkx 
from networkx.algorithms.components.connected import connected_components


def to_graph( l ):
 G = networkx.Graph()
 for part in l:
  # each sublist is a bunch of nodes
  G.add_nodes_from(part)
  # it also imlies a number of edges:
  G.add_edges_from(to_edges(part))
 return G

def to_edges( l ):
 """ sees `l` as a Graph and returns it's edges 
  to_edges(['a','b','c','d']) -&gt; [(a,b), (b,c),(c,d)]
 """

 it = iter(l)
 last = next(it)

 # keep the last item, yield it with the current
 for current in it:
  yield last, current
  last = current


G = to_graph(l)
print connected_components(G)
# prints [['a', 'c', 'b', 'e', 'd', 'g', 'f', 'o', 'p'], ['k']]
 

 To solve this efficiently yourself you have to convert the list into something graph-ish anyways, so you might as well use networkX from the start. 
 #3 My attempt. Has functional look to it. 

 #!/usr/bin/python
from collections import defaultdict
l = [['a','b','c'],['b','d','e'],['k'],['o','p'],['e','f'],['p','a'],['d','g']]
hashdict = defaultdict(int)

def hashit(x, y):
 for i in y: x[i] += 1
 return x

def merge(x, y):
 sums = sum([hashdict[i] for i in y])
 if sums &gt; len(y):
  x[0] = x[0].union(y)
 else:
  x[1] = x[1].union(y)
 return x


hashdict = reduce(hashit, l, hashdict)
sets = reduce(merge, l, [set(),set()])
print [list(sets[0]), list(sets[1])]
 
 #4 Without knowing quite what you want, I decided to just guess you meant: I want to find every element just once. 

 #!/usr/bin/python


def clink(l, acc):
 for sub in l:
 if sub.__class__ == list:
  clink(sub, acc)
 else:
  acc[sub]=1

def clunk(l):
 acc = {}
 clink(l, acc)
 print acc.keys()

l = [['a', 'b', 'c'], ['b', 'd', 'e'], ['k'], ['o', 'p'], ['e', 'f'], ['p', 'a'], ['d', 'g']]

clunk(l)
 

 Output looks like: 

 ['a', 'c', 'b', 'e', 'd', 'g', 'f', 'k', 'o', 'p']
 
 #5 I came across the same issue of trying to merge down lists with common values. This example may be what you are looking for.
It only loops over lists once and updates resultset as it goes. 

 lists = [['a','b','c'],['b','d','e'],['k'],['o','p'],['e','f'],['p','a'],['d','g']]
lists = sorted([sorted(x) for x in lists]) #Sorts lists in place so you dont miss things. Trust me, needs to be done.

resultslist = [] #Create the empty result list.

if len(lists) &gt;= 1: # If your list is empty then you dont need to do anything.
 resultlist = [lists[0]] #Add the first item to your resultset
 if len(lists) &gt; 1: #If there is only one list in your list then you dont need to do anything.
  for l in lists[1:]: #Loop through lists starting at list 1
   listset = set(l) #Turn you list into a set
   merged = False #Trigger
   for index in range(len(resultlist)): #Use indexes of the list for speed.
    rset = set(resultlist[index]) #Get list from you resultset as a set
    if len(listset &amp; rset) != 0: #If listset and rset have a common value then the len will be greater than 1
     resultlist[index] = list(listset | rset) #Update the resultlist with the updated union of listset and rset
     merged = True #Turn trigger to True
     break #Because you found a match there is no need to continue the for loop.
   if not merged: #If there was no match then add the list to the resultset, so it doesnt get left out.
    resultlist.append(l)
print resultlist
 

 # 

 resultset = [['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'g', 'f', 'o', 'p'], ['k']]
