Question (ID-2501208): Copying and pasting code into the Python interpreter There is a snippet of code that I would like to copy and paste into my Python interpreter. Unfortunately due to Python's sensitivity to whitespace it is not straightforward to copy and paste it a way that makes sense. (I think the whitespace gets mangled) Is there a better way? Maybe I can load the snippet from a file. 

 This is just an small example but if there is a lot of code I would like to avoid typing everything from the definition of the function or copy and pasting line by line. 

 class bcolors: 
 HEADER = '\033[95m' 
 OKBLUE = '\033[94m' 
 OKGREEN = '\033[92m' 
 WARNING = '\033[93m' 
 FAIL = '\033[91m' 
 ENDC = '\033[0m' 

 def disable(self): 
  self.HEADER = '' # I think stuff gets mangled because of the extra level of indentation 
  self.OKBLUE = '' 
  self.OKGREEN = '' 
  self.WARNING = '' 
  self.FAIL = '' 
  self.ENDC = ''
 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 You can just import the file into the python interpreter. This will load the class in, and allow you to run the code. 

 For instance, create a file named "bgcolors.py" and copy and paste your code inside. Then using the python interpreter, you just type "import bgcolors" and you should be able to run it.

 #1 You can use IPython which is much better python repl. It has command for getting input from external editor by using %edit command. 
 #2 You can usually easily and safely do copy-pasting with IPython , through the commands %cpaste and %paste . This is very handy for testing code that you copy from web pages, for instance, or from your editor. IPython also has a %run command that runs a program and leaves you in a Python shell with all the variables that were defined in the program, so that you can play with them. 
 #3 The IDLE interface does go to effort to preserve the proper indentation of pasted text. 
 #4 You can call execfile(filename). More or less the same as importing a module, except that it skips the module administration part and doesn't require you to add a folder to sys.path. 

 EDIT: To address the original question: copy-pasted code can be executed by calling exec(codestring). 
 #5 Dreampie allows you to copy and paste code with proper indentation.
