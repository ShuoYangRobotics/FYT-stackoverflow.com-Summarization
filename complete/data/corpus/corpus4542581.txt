Question (ID-4542581): Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner I'm a python noob and I'm getting to grips with python via 'Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner (2nd Edition - Python 2.3, but I'm using 2.7)'. 

 The book presents challenges to complete and I'm having trouble getting my head round one of them; any help would be greatly appreciated as I want to get my head around this before I move on. 

 Chapter 3, Challenge 3 - Guess My Number: Modify the code below to limit the number of tries a player has to guess the number. 

 How would I go about doing this? The attempts I've made so far to set a variable, have all ended with the answer being revealed whether the user gets the answer right or not. Thanks in advance guys. 

 
 Guess My Number 
 
 The computer picks a random number between 1 and 100> The player tries to guess it and 
 the computer lets the player know if the guess is too high, too low or right on the money 
 

 import random

print "\tWelcome to 'Guess My Number'!"
print "\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100." 
print "Try to guess it in as few attempts as possible.\n"

# set the initial values
the_number = random.randrange(100) + 1
guess = int(raw_input("Take a guess: "))
tries = 1

# guessing loop
while (guess != the_number):
 if (guess &gt; the_number):
  print "Lower..."
 else:
  print "Higher..."

guess = int(raw_input("Take a guess: "))
tries += 1

print "You guessed it! The number was", the_number
print "And it only took you", tries, "tries!\n"

raw_input("\n\nPress the enter key to exit.")
 

 So far, I've attempted the following unsuccessfully. 

 import random 

print "\tWelcome to 'Guess My Number'!"
print "\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100." 
print "Try to guess it in as few attempts as possible.\n"

# set the initial values
the_number = random.randrange(100) + 1
guess = int(raw_input("Take a guess: "))
tries = 1
limit = 8

# guessing loop
while (guess != the_number and tries &lt; limit):
 if (guess &gt; the_number):
  print "Lower..."
 elif (guess &lt; the_number):
  print "Higher..."
 else:
  print "You've used all " + limit -1 +"of your attempts \
and didn't get the right answer. Shame on You!"

 guess = int(raw_input("Take a guess: "))
 tries += 1

print "You guessed it! The number was", the_number
print "And it only took you", tries, "tries!\n"

raw_input("\n\nPress the enter key to exit.")
 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 You have a tries variable there. How about checking it inside while and if it reaches a certain value, you print a message to the user and exit ;) 
 #1 I think what this exercise wants to teach you is the break statement. Before you had only one exit condition (guessing the number) but now you have also the limited number of tries. 

 One straight way to do this: 

 import random

print "\tWelcome to 'Guess My Number'!"
print "\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100." 
print "Try to guess it in as few attempts as possible.\n"

# set the initial values
the_number = random.randrange(100) + 1

limit = 5
tries = 0

# guessing loop
while True: # we will test the conditions separately in the loop, not here
 # take a guess
 guess = int(raw_input("Take a guess: "))
 tries += 1 

 # first check the number
 if (guess &gt; the_number):
  print "Lower..."
 elif (guess &lt; the_number):
  print "Higher..."
 else: # it can only be equal here
  print "You guessed it! The number was", the_number
  print "And it only took you", tries, "tries!\n"
  break # exit the while loop

 # now the tries:
 if tries == limit:
  print "You've used all %d of your attempts \
and didn't get the right answer. Shame on You!" % limit
  break

raw_input("\n\nPress the enter key to exit.")
 
 #2 Something like this: 

 import random

print "\tWelcome to 'Guess My Number'!"
print "\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100." 
print "Try to guess it in as few attempts as possible.\n"

# set the initial values
the_number = random.randrange(100) + 1
guess = int(raw_input("Take a guess: "))
tries = 1
max_tries = 5

# guessing loop
while ((tries &lt; max_tries) &amp;&amp; (guess != the_number)):
 if (guess &gt; the_number):
  print "Lower..."
 else:
  print "Higher..."
 tries += 1
 guess = int(raw_input("Take a guess: "))

if tries == max_tries:
 print "Max # of tries exceeded"
else:
 print "You guessed it! The number was", the_number
 print "And it only took you", tries, "tries!\n"

raw_input("\n\nPress the enter key to exit.")
 
 #3 You don't have a loop around the guessing, which means the guessing happens only once. You need to put the whole guessing and testing structure inside some sort of loop ( for or while ). 
 #4 Your attempt is almost correct". There are two problems I can see. The first lies here: 

 print "You guessed it! The number was", the_number
print "And it only took you", tries, "tries!\n"
 

 Think about how you can execute the above only if max tries was not exceeded. Hint: You need to add one line and make a minor adjustment to the two lines above. 

 The second lies here: 

  else:
  print "You've used all " + limit -1 +"of your attempts \
and didn't get the right answer. Shame on You!"
 

 Will that else block ever execute? Take a look back at the while condition to see why. Again, there's a simple way to fix this. 
 #5 I'm just starting with programming and Python as well, using the same book. Here is what I came up with, and it seems to work! 

 # Guess My Number
#
# The computer picks a random number between 1 and 100
# The player tries to guess it and the computer lets
# the player know if the guess is too high, too low
# or right on the money

import random 

print("\tWelcome to 'Guess My Number'!")
print("\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.")
print("Try to guess it in as few attempts as possible.\n")

# set the initial values
the_number = random.randint(1, 100)
guess = int(input("Take a guess: "))

tries = 1
max_tries = 8

# guessing loop
while tries &lt; max_tries and guess != the_number:

 if guess &gt; the_number:
  print("Lower...")
 elif guess &lt; the_number:
  print("Higher...")

 guess = int(input("Take a guess: "))
 tries += 1

# having it stop if person uses maximum number of tries
if tries &gt;= max_tries:

 print("Ruh roh. Looks like you're finished, pardner. The number was", the_number)

# text if person gets the right number within the number of tries.
else:
 if guess == the_number:
  print("You guessed it! The number was", the_number)
  print("And it only took you", tries, "tries!\n")

input("\n\nPress the enter key to exit.")
