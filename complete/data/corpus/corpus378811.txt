Question (ID-378811): Getting python to work, Internal Server Error I'm trying to get Python scripts, called from a web browser, to work. I keep getting the error: 

 500 Internal Server Error
 

 When I check my error logs I see the message 

 Premature end of script headers
 

 The only documentation of this error online says that it can be the result of having improper line return characters in your script, but I wrote my test script right from the shell with pico. Also, when I run the file from the command line it executes just fine. 
"
So far the only change I have made to apache is to add the .py to the "AddHandler cgi-script" line. 

 Thanks! 

 

 Thanks for the quick responses. Here is the latest version of the test code. I added a couple new lines before the output as suggested but still get the same error: 

 #!/usr/local/bin/python
print "Content-type: text/html\n"
print "\n\n"
print "&lt;HTML&gt;"
print "&lt;HEAD&gt;"
print "&lt;TITLE&gt;Test&lt;/TITLE&gt;"
print "&lt;/HEAD&gt;"
print "&lt;BODY&gt;"
print "&lt;H2&gt;Hi there.&lt;/h2&gt;"
print "&lt;/BODY&gt;"
print "&lt;/HTML&gt;"
 

 Some other details: I am running Apache 1.3 and don't have mod_python. I set apache to recognize .py as mentioned above. I am running the script from the main public_html folder. 

 

 An update. It doesn't seem to matter what I put in the shebang line. I tried all of the suggestions and even if I leave it blank the same error is showing up in the errors log and I'm getting a 500 error. 

 I'm running Apache/1.3.41 on linux (red hat 3.4) with WHM/Cpanel installed.

 Make sure you are outputting the Content-Type: text/html header 
 Make sure you are adding two newlines ("\n") after the headers before you output "Hello, world" or whatever. 
 
 #1 This is the exact behavior you would get if your Python script does not have the executable permission set. 

 Try: 

 chmod a+x foo.py
 

 (where foo.py is your script name). 

 See the Apache tutorial for more information. 
 #2 do you have something like this at the top before you print anything else? 

 print "Content-type: text/html\n"
 

 If you already have this, then post your code. 
 #3 You may also get a better error message by adding this line at the top of your Python script: 

 import cgitb; cgitb.enable() 

 Also, the header should be capitalized Content-Type , not Content-type , although I doubt that that is breaking anything. 
 #4 OK last guess: 

 Trying changing that shebang line to: 

 #!/usr/bin/env python
 

 or 

 #!/usr/bin/local/env python
 

 It would also be helpful to know your platform / hosting provider. 
 #5 I had a similiar problem running my own local server, but got it solved following this guide step-by-step: HOWTO Use Python in the web 
 #6 Sounds to me like you're using a script written in Windows on a Unix machine, without first converting the line-endings from 0d0a to 0a. It should be easy to convert it. One way is with your ftp program; transfer the file in ASCII mode. The way I use with Metapad is to use File->FileFormat before saving.
