Question (ID-4004299): No such file or directory error This is the error I am getting: 

 Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "E:\stuff\module.py", line 91, in &lt;module&gt;
 f = open('E:/stuff/log.txt')
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'E:/stuff/log.txt'
 

 And this is my code: 

 f = open('E:/stuff/log.txt')
 

 The E:/stuff/log.txt file exists. I can navigate in Windows Explorer and open it so why can't I open it? 

 EDIT: 

 Output of DIR command: 

 C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator&gt;dir e:\stuff
 Volume in drive E has no label.
 Volume Serial Number is 5660-4957

 Directory of e:\stuff

 I am running the python script from the cmd like this: 

 python E:\stuff\module.py
 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Firstly, from above, Windows supports / just fine. 

 Secondly:
Well, if you look at your file, you'll notice it's not log.txt, it's log.txt.txt... You may see it as "log.txt" in your graphical folder viewer (as opposed to the CLI "dir" command) simply because it hides the known file extensions. 

 I recommend you disable this - see folder options, there should be an option "Hide extensions of known file types" (or similar). 
 #1 Look at this line in the "dir" output: 

 23. 10. 2010 15:47     0 log.txt.txt
 

 The file you are looking for is named "log.txt.txt", not "log.txt". I see this happen when people set up the Windows file manager to not show known file extensions and then they try to add or modify an extension. I recommend to others that they turn this behavior off. You can do this under View->Folder Options I believe. 
 #2 how about reading permissions? maybe not authorized to read (default mode of open) 
 #3 Since it is windows, and the backslash is a escape character, you must double the backslash to escape it. Try 

 e:\\stuff\\log.txt
 
 #4 it been a long time that i didn't use windows, but if i remember well windows use back-slash in system path so you should do: 

 import os

file_name = os.path.join("e:\\stuff", "log.txt")

f = open(file_name)
 

 and not: 

 f = open('E:/stuff/log.txt')
 

 there is not / in paths in windows. 
 #5 Define you path names using os.path.join() 

 root="E:\\"
mylog = os.path.join(root,"stuff","log.txt") # or log.txt.txt as seen in your dir output
f = open(mylog)
...
f.close()
