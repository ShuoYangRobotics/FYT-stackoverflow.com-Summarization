Question (ID-517970): How to clear python interpreter console? Like most Python developers, I typically keep a console window open with the Python interpreter running to test commands, dir() stuff, help() stuff, etc. 

 Like any console, after a while the visible backlog of past commands and prints gets to be cluttered, and sometimes confusing when re-running the same command several times. I'm wondering if, and how, to clear the Python interpreter console. 

 I've heard about doing a system call and either calling cls on Windows or clear on Linux, but I was hoping there was something I could command the interpreter itself to do. 

 Note: I'm running on Windows, so Ctrl+L doesn't work. 
 Answers (Total-13): #0 As you mentioned, you can do a system call: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; clear = lambda: os.system('cls')
&gt;&gt;&gt; clear()
 

 I am not sure of any other way in Windows. 
 #1 here something handy that is a little more cross-platform 

 import os

def cls():
 os.system(['clear','cls'][os.name == 'nt'])

# now, to clear the screen
cls()
 
 #2 Well, here's a quick hack: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; clear = "\n" * 100
&gt;&gt;&gt; print clear
&gt;&gt;&gt; ...do some other stuff...
&gt;&gt;&gt; print clear
 

 Or to save some typing, put this file in your python search path: 

 # wiper.py
class Wipe(object):
 def __repr__(self):
  return '\n'*1000

wipe = Wipe()
 

 Then you can do this from the interpreter all you like :) 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; from wiper import wipe
&gt;&gt;&gt; wipe
&gt;&gt;&gt; wipe
&gt;&gt;&gt; wipe
 
 #3 Although this is an older question, I thought I'd contribute something summing up what I think were the best of the other answers and add a wrinkle of my own by suggesting that you put these command(s) into a file and set your PYTHONSTARTUP environment variable to point to it. Since I'm on Windows at the moment, it's slightly biased that way, but could easily be slanted some other direction. 

 Anyway, here's my take on the code to put (or add to your existing) Python startup script: 

 # ==== pythonstartup.py ====

# add something to clear the screen
class cls(object):
 def __repr__(self):
  import os
  os.system('cls' if os.name == 'nt' else 'clear')
  return ''

cls = cls()

# ==== end pythonstartup.py ====
 

 BTW, you can also use @ Triptych's __repr__ trick to change exit() into just exit : 

 class exit(object):
 exit = exit # original object
 def __repr__(self):
  self.exit() # call original
  return ''

exit = exit()
 

 Lastly, here's something else that changes the primary interpreter prompt from &gt;&gt;&gt; to cwd + &gt;&gt;&gt; : 

 class Prompt:
 def __str__(self):
  import os
  return '%s &gt;&gt;&gt; ' % os.getcwd()

import sys
sys.ps1 = Prompt()
del sys
del Prompt
 
 #4 Use idle. It has many handy features. F6, for example, resets the console. Closing and opening the console are good ways to clear it. 
 #5 Wiper is cool, good thing about it is I don't have to type '()' around it.
Here is slight variation to it 

 # wiper.py
import os
class Cls(object):
 def __repr__(self):
        os.system('cls')
  return ''
 

 The usage is quite simple: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; cls = Cls()
&gt;&gt;&gt; cls # this will clear console.
 
 #6 I'm using MINGW/BASH on Windows XP, SP3. 

 (stick this in .pythonstartup) 
 # My ctrl-l already kind of worked, but this might help someone else 
 # leaves prompt at bottom of the window though... 
import readline 
readline.parse_and_bind('\C-l: clear-screen') 

 # This works in BASH because I have it in .inputrc as well, but for some 
 # reason it gets dropped when I go into Python 
readline.parse_and_bind('\C-y: kill-whole-line') 

 

 I couldn't stand typing 'exit()' anymore and was delighted with martineau's/Triptych's tricks: 

 I slightly doctored it though (stuck it in .pythonstartup) 

 class exxxit():
 """Shortcut for exit() function, use 'x' now"""
 quit_now = exit # original object
 def __repr__(self):
  self.quit_now() # call original
x = exxxit()

 #7 EDIT: I've just read "windows", this is for linux users, sorry. 

 

 In bash: 

 #!/bin/bash

while [ "0" == "0" ]; do
 clear
 $@
 while [ "$input" == "" ]; do
  read -p "Do you want to quit? (y/n): " -n 1 -e input
  if [ "$input" == "y" ]; then
   exit 1
  elif [ "$input" == "n" ]; then
   echo "Ok, keep working ;)"
  fi
 done
 input=""
done
 

 Save it as "whatyouwant.sh", chmod +x it then run: 

 ./whatyouwant.sh python
 

 or something other than python (idle, whatever).
This will ask you if you actually want to exit, if not it rerun python (or the command you gave as parameter). 

 This will clear all, the screen and all the variables/object/anything you created/imported in python. 

 In python just type exit() when you want to exit. 
 #8 This should be cross platform, and also uses the preferred subprocess.call instead of os.system as per the os.system docs . Should work in Python >= 2.4. 

 import subprocess
import os

if os.name == 'nt':
 def clearscreen():
  subprocess.call("cls", shell=True)
  return
else:
 def clearscreen():
  subprocess.call("clear", shell=True)
  return
 
 #9 One small point - This will not work in IDLE is you are using windows. 
 #10 Here are two nice ways of doing that: 

 1. 

 import os

# Clear Windows command prompt.
if (os.name in ('ce', 'nt', 'dos')) == True:
 os.system('cls')

# Clear the Linux terminal.
elif ('posix' in os.name) == True:
 os.system('clear')
 

 2. 

 import os

def clear():
 if os.name == 'posix':
  os.system('clear')

 elif os.name == ('ce', 'nt', 'dos'):
  os.system('cls')


clear()
 
 #11 How about this for a clear 

 - os.system('cls')
 

 That is about as short as could be! 
 #12 The OS command clear in Linux and cls in Windows outputs a "magic string" which you can just print. To get the string, execute the command with popen and save it in a variable for later use: 

 from os import popen
with popen('clear') as f:
 clear = f.read()

print clear
 

 On my machine the string is '\x1b[H\x1b[2J' .
