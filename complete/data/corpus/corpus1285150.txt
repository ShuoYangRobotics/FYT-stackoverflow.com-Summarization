Question (ID-1285150): Implement Comet / Server push in Google App Engine in Python How can I implement Comet / Server push in Google App Engine in Python? 
 Answers (Total-9): #0 We just announced the Channel API to do comet push with App Engine apps: http://googleappengine.blogspot.com/2010/05/app-engine-at-google-io-2010.html 

 If you're at Google IO, I'll be talking about this at 1pm tomorrow (on the APIs track): http://code.google.com/events/io/2010/sessions/building-real-time-apps-app-engine-feed-api.html 

 Here's the YouTube video of the session: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMXe-xK0BWA 

 Hopefully last update! This is now released: code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/channel 
 #1 At this time, I would rule out doing Comet in App Engine (any language). Comet is based on long-lived HTTP connections, and App Engine will time out any single connection in about 30 seconds or so at most; it's hard to conceive of a worse match! 
 #2 I found this article which explains a sort of comet. It is not really but you can simulate realtime with it. It uses an external service

 #3 Comet (or something like it - XMPP API) is on the google app engine roadmap. For now, stay away.

 #4 I would have commented on Moishe's answer , however my reputation doesn't seem to allow that... Here's that video to the Google I/O talk that describes the Channel API (only available to trusted developers for the moment, soon to be out)

 #5 30 seconds is more than enough; either way you should return a no-op message when a time passed and no new events occur. 

 This prevents client timeouts and is done by everybody who does comet. 

 Just send the request, and on the server make it wait until an event or timeout after 25 seconds. 
 #6 Looking inside the App Engine 1.3.8-pre release, I see the Channel API service stub and more code. So it looks like we can start trying it out locally. 
 #7 Google App Engine supports server push using the Channel API since 2nd December. 
 #8 This is not a simple question to answer. Reading this wiki might give you a hint as to the implementation you'd like to undertake. You might have to write the HTTP server yourself to implement sockets which remain open.
