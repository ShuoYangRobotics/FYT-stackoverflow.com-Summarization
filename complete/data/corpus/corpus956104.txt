Question (ID-956104): Is there a static analysis tool for Python, Ruby, Sql, Cobol, Perl, and PL/SQL? I am looking for a static analysis tool for Python, Ruby, Sql, Cobol, Perl, PL/SQL, SQL similar to find bugs and check style. I am looking for calculating the line count, identify bugs during the development, and enforcing coding standard. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Perl has Perl::Critic (and perlcritic.com ) 
 #1 I use PyChecker and pylint as Python code checkers. However it seems that they get buggy when you use some modules (e.g., socket or pygame , IIRC). 
 #2 For Ruby, you're probably best served looking at this previous SO question: 

 http://stackoverflow.com/questions/286564/can-anyone-recommend-a-ruby-source-code-analyzer-something-like-pylint 

 which seems pretty thorough. 
 #3 I use Pylint for Python which was nicely integrated into Komodo by Brandon Corfman (if ActiveState's Komodo is your thing). 
 #4 Sonar has a PL/SQL plugin that is based on Toad CodeXpert code analyzer. 
 #5 See various static analysis tools from Semantic 
Designs . 

 These cover standard metrics for Java, C# and COBOL. There are also tools to detect duplicate code (clones) for many languages, including Python, Java, PL/SQL (from your list). 

 Finally, there is a style checker (coding standards checks) for COBOL (with optional Eclipse plugin) that offers refactoring support to fix some of the style errors.
