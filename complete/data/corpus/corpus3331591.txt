Question (ID-3331591): Python for-loop counter error I am attempting to script a short code to figure out the number of days it takes to reach a given principal in the bank due to daily interest. Using my code below does not yield any errors when run in IDLE, but the counter returns 0. Any ideas what I missed? 

 def main():
 # irrelevant code elided by msw, Bal, Int and Tar are numeric
 counter = 0
 for i in range(0):
  if (Bal * Int) == Tar:
   print '1'
  else:
   counter + 1
 print counter
 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 I'm not sure what you're getting at with this loop: 

 for i in range(0):
 if (Bal * Int) == Tar:
  print '1'
 else:
  counter + 1
 

 
 range(0) is an empty list, so the loop won't execute at all. 
 counter + 1 simply calculates one more than counter, it won't increment counter, you probably mean counter += 1 
 There's nothing in the loop that changes at each iteration, so if you ever get into it, it will be an infinite loop. 
 
 #1 I believe the formula to calculate final balance with interest is: 

 Final = Principal * ( 1 + interest ) ** interest_period
 

 Assuming I got this correct, then you can find out how many interest periods it will take by: 

 def how_long(start_money, interest_rate, final_money):
 day = 0
 money = start_money
 while True:
  if money &gt;= final_money:
   break
  day += 1
  money = start_money * (1 + interest_rate)**day

 return day, money
 
 #2 In [5]: def test():
 ...:  for i in range(0):
 ...:   return '1'
 ...:  
 ...:  

In [6]: x = test()

In [7]: print x
------&gt; print(x)
None
 

 See the return value is 'None'.
I don't know what are you trying to do. But The basic mistake is the Argument of range(x) function. The range(0) always return empty list. 
 #3 That's because you put range(0) which is an empty loop. Perhaps you could consider a while loop? 
 #4 Your loop for i in range(0) doesn't actually execute. range(0) returns an empty list [] which will skip the body of your for loop. 
 #5 Please explain what you think this does? Please update your question with an English-language explanation of how many times you think this look will work. 

 counter = 0
for i in range(0):
 if (Bal * Int) == Tar:
  print '1'
 else:
  counter + 1
 

 Hint. The answer is zero. The question is "why?" and "what were you trying to do?" 
 #6 You have been told the three or more problems with your code. If there's no particular reason to use a loop, it's better calculated with a formula: 

 future_value = present_value * (1 + interest_rate_per_period) ** number_of periods
 

 or, for short, 

 f = p * (1 + i) ** n
f / p = (1 + i) ** n
log(f / p) = n * log(1 + i)
n = log(f / p) / log(i + i)
 

 Example: I have $5000; how many years will it take to grow to $10000 at 10% per annum? 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; from math import log
&gt;&gt;&gt; f = 10000.0
&gt;&gt;&gt; p = 5000.0
&gt;&gt;&gt; i = 0.1
&gt;&gt;&gt; n = log(f / p) / log(1 + i)
&gt;&gt;&gt; n
