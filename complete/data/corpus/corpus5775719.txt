Question (ID-5775719): How do I find the first letter of each word? Ok, I'm trying to figure out how to make a inputed phrase such as this in python .... 

 Self contained underwater breathing apparatus 

 output this... 

 SCUBA 

 Which would be the first letter of each word. Is this something to do with index? and maybe a .upper function? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 This is the pythonic way to do it: 

 output = "".join(item[0].upper() for item in input.split())
# SCUBA
 

 There you go. Short and easy to understand. 

 LE :
If you have other delimiters than space, you can split by words, like this: 

 import re
input = "self-contained underwater breathing apparatus"
output = "".join(item[0].upper() for item in re.findall("\w+", input))
# SCUBA
 
 #1 Here's the quickest way to get it done 

 input = "Self contained underwater breathing apparatus"
output = ""
for i in input.upper().split():
 output += i[0]
 
 #2 #here is my trial, brief and potent!
str = 'Self contained underwater breathing apparatus'
reduce(lambda x,y: x+y[0].upper(),str.split(),'')
#=&gt; SCUBA
 
 #3 s = "Self contained underwater breathing apparatus" 
for item in s.split():
 print item[0].upper()
 
 #4 Pythonic Idioms 

 
 Using a generator expression over str.split() 
 Optimize the inner loop by moving upper() to one call at outside of the loop. 
 

 Implementation: 

 input = 'Self contained underwater breathing apparatus'
output = ''.join(word[0] for word in input.split()).upper()
 
 #5 Some list comprehension love: 

 "".join([word[0].upper() for word in sentence.split()])
