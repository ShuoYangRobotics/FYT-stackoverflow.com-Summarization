Question (ID-8443286): Select strings by positions of words For the following tuple 

 mysentence = 'i have a dog and a cat', 'i have a cat and a dog', 'i have a cat', 
    'i have a dog'
 

 How to select only the strings 'i have a cat' , 'i have a dog', i.e exclude strings having the word dog or cat in the middle. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 You can do this with regular expressions. The regex .+(dog|cat).+ will match one or more characters, followed by dog or cat, and one of more characters afterwards. You can then use filter to find strings which don't match this regex: 

 import re
regex.compile(r'.+(dog|cat).+')
sentence = 'i have a dog and a cat', 'i have a cat and a dog', 'i have a cat', 
   'i have a dog'
filtered_sentence = filter(lambda s: not regex.match(s), sentence)
 
 #1 You could use a Regular Expression to match the sentences you don't want. 

 We can build up the pattern as follows: 

 
 We want to match dog or cat - (dog|cat) 
 followed by a space, i.e. not at the end of the line 
 

 So our code looks like so: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; mysentence = ('i have a dog and a cat', 'i have a cat and a dog', 'i have a cat', 'i have a dog')
&gt;&gt;&gt; import re                 
&gt;&gt;&gt; pattern = re.compile("(dog|cat) ")
&gt;&gt;&gt; [x for x in mysentence if not pattern.search(x)]       
['i have a cat', 'i have a dog']
 
 #2 If the string should just end with a specific phrase then this will do the job: 

 phases = ("I have a cat", "I have a dog")
for sentence in mysentence:
 for phase in phases:
  if sentence.lower().endswith(phase.lower()):
   print(sentence)
 
 #3 Simplest thing that could possibly work: 

 In [10]: [phrase for phrase in mysentence if not ' and ' in phrase]
Out[10]: ['i have a cat', 'i have a dog']
 
 #4 You can use regexp or string methods. 

 I see other answered with regex, so I try string methods: with string.find() you will get position of substring in string. Then check if it is in the middle of the sentence. 

 def filter_function(sentence, words):
 for word in words:
  p = sentence.find(word)
  if p &gt; 0 and p &lt; len(sentence) - len(word):
   return 0
 return 1

for sentence in mysentence:
 print('%s: %d' % (sentence, filter_function(sentence, ['dog', 'cat'])))
 

 You also must define what to do when you will have only 'cat' in sentence. 
 #5 for items in mysentence:
 if (items.find("dog")&gt;=0)^(items.find("cat")&gt;=0):
  print(items)
 

 You just need an xor operator and the find function. No need to import
