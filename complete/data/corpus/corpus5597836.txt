Question (ID-5597836): How can I embed(create) an interactive python shell in my python program Is is possible to start a interactive python shell in a python program? 

 For example, I want to use this interactive python shell to inspect some program internal variables.

 #1 I've had this code for a long time, I hope you can put it to use. 

 To inspect/use variables, just put them into the current namespace. As an example, I can access var1 and var2 from the command line. 

 var1 = 5
var2 = "Mike"
# Credit to effbot.org/librarybook/code.htm for loading variables into current namespace
def keyboard(banner=None):
 import code, sys

 # use exception trick to pick up the current frame
 try:
  raise None
 except:
  frame = sys.exc_info()[2].tb_frame.f_back

 # evaluate commands in current namespace
 namespace = frame.f_globals.copy()
 namespace.update(frame.f_locals)

 code.interact(banner=banner, local=namespace)


if __name__ == '__main__':
 keyboard()
 

 However if you wanted to strictly debug your application, I'd highly suggest using an IDE or pdb(python debugger) . 
 #2 The code module provides an interactive console: 

 import code
vars = globals().copy()
vars.update(locals())
shell = code.InteractiveConsole(vars)
shell.interact()
 
 #3 Using IPython you just have to call: 

 from IPython.Shell import IPShellEmbed; IPShellEmbed()()
 
 #4 You can do this using IPython:

 #5 If all you're interested in is inspecting the value of variables, why not put them in a dict and use some kind of regex interface to access them by string? This doesn't allow as much freedom which could possibly be a perk. 
 #6 Another trick (besides the ones already suggested) is opening an interactive shell and importing your (perhaps modified) python script. Upon importing, most of the variables, functions, classes and so on (depending on how the whole thing is prepared) are available, and you could even create objects interactively from command line. So, if you have a test.py file, you could open Idle or other shell, and type import test (if it is in current working directory).
