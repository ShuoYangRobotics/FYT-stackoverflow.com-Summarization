Question (ID-2036987): Online IDE for Python Is there any web-based IDE that I can use to run quick tests? There're a dozen for PHP and some for even Java but I haven't found yet that runs Python. If there's an open-source IDE available that I can host and run myself , that'd be better. 

 Thanks

 You might want to give a try at: 

 
 Py I/O 
 Try Python 
 codepad 
 codenode 
 
 #1 Codepad can compile code, if it's what you're looking for. 
 #2 http://shell.appspot.com/ The google AppEngine shell (not really an IDE though). 
 #3 I'm pretty sure that IDE's are the last kind of programs that will ever go web based, because a good IDE needs to be so extremely interactive if it wants to be good. 

 I really don't see a reason for this and others seem to agree because there isn't any.
And no, an interactive web shell or compiler has nothing to do with an IDE. 
 #4 I'm trying out PythonAnywhere.com and it has in-browser support for both 3.2 and 2.7. It also lets you sync to dropbox and deploy right to the web. 
 #5 Through not specifically for python Codepad is good too. 
 #6 Mozilla Bespin is an interesting project ( user guide ). 

 It is a Mozilla labs open source project to build a browser-based IDE. You can host it yourself, see the Bespin developer guide . 

 I don't think it is currently a full-fledged Python IDE, but I believe it could be made into one with a bit of effort. The Bespin server is written in Python. 
 #7 ideone.com is able to compile and run Python. There is also an integrated web editor - perfect for quick tests. It is not an open source but you can use Ideone API to build your service. 
 #8 Google Chrome Python Shell https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/gdiimmpmdoofmahingpgabiikimjgcia
