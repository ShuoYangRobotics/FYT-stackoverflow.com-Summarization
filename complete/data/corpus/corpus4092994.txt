Question (ID-4092994): Unable to install matplotlib on Mac OS X I'm trying to install matplotlib for graphing applications in Python on Mac OS X. When I run "python setup.py install", it gives me this load of errors: http://pastebin.com/u7fL37ic . 

 A quick snippet: 

 src/ft2font.cpp:2170: error: ‘FT_LOAD_TARGET_MONO’ was not declared in this scope

 I installed freetype using MacPorts, and I thought that would fix the issue, but no luck. Gives me same error as before. It looks like it can't find the right freetype files: 

 BUILDING MATPLOTLIB
  matplotlib: 1.0.0
   python: 2.6.5 (r265:79359, Mar 24 2010, 01:32:55) [GCC

   freetype2: found, but unknown version (no pkg-config)
     * WARNING: Could not find 'freetype2' headers in any
     * of '.', './freetype2'.
 

 Where should I put the freetype files so that they can be found? Right now they're in /opt/local/lib 

 Any ideas?

 #1 you may also consider using the Enthought distribution (which comes even free for non-commercial usage)
It comes fully installed without any difficulty

(I have no relationship with Enthought whatsoever - I'm just a satisfied user) 
 #2 Here's how I did it: 

 $ sudo make -f make.osx fetch deps mpl_build mpl_install
 

 This will install it in /lib/python2.6/site-packages , just move its contents to /Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/ for consistency. 
 #3 I was given a new work computer recently (MacBook Pro OS 10.6.5), and wanted to install numpy + scipy + matplotlib in a Python virtual environment. I'm not an expert, but the virtual environment seems to allow you to install packages such that they are isolated from the system-wide packages, essentially by redefining the system path in a clever way. So, for one project I am working on that requires certain versions of these packages, I can install them once and do all of my work for that project there, independently of other changes I make outside the environment. 

 After a lot of trial and error, I was able to build a virtual environment with Numpy 1.5.1, Scipy 0.8.0, and Matplotlib 1.0.0 all running flawlessly. Here's how: 

 First, install the following four packages: 

 
 freetype-2.4.4 
 libpng , version 1.4.5 found at http://ethan.tira-thompson.org/Mac_OS_X_Ports.html . Installation of matplotlib failed when I tried to install 1.5.0 from source! 
 pkg-config , version 0.23 
 virtualenv for Python2.6 
 

 (I'm a new user so I can't post links to these, sorry!). 

 If you install from source, use a standard install: 

 
 $ ./configure 
 $ make 
 $ sudo make install 
 

 Next, download the source files for numpy, scipy, and matplotlib. 

 Now it's time to create a virtual environment in folder TESTENV: 

 $ virtualenv /path/to/dir/TESTENV 

 Activate the virtual environment: 

 $ source . /path/to/dir/TESTENV/bin/activate 

 Now, python packages will be installed within TESTENV as if it were the root installation directory. What worked for me was to execute: 

 $ python setupegg.py install 

 in the numpy, scipy, and matplotlib source folders (in that order). 

 Hope that helps! 
 #4 I would highly recommend the StrongInference Scipy Superpack . It works with the built-in Apple supplied Python on 10.6 Snow Leopard. It's friendly to both 32-bit and 64-bit installs. It does not require installing a separate Python distribution or package managers like Macports or Fink. 

 Use it by first downloading the shell script from this page . Then: 

 sh superpack_10.6_2011.03.07.sh
 

 or replace superpack_10.6_2011.03.07.sh with the name of the latest shell script as they update it from time to time. 

 To use it, make sure you type in ipython and not python! 
 #5 I followed this page's instructions . I got stuck at 

 pip install -e git+https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib#egg=matplotlib-dev
 

 Then I did: 

 git clone https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib.git
cd matplotlib
python setup.py build
python setup.py install
 

 Checked my installation by typing in terminal: 

 python
import matplotlib
print matplotlib.__version__
print matplotlib.__file__
 

 I got version 0.10.0 dev (as of this writing) and path /usr/local/Cellar/... 
 #6 I like using the brew, and none of the top three explanations worked or were enticing to me. However, I did look some more, and found this brew friendly explanation and solution:

 Summary: libpng on Snow Leopard isn't on friendly terms with matplotlib. You can manually install the un-released matplotlib to work around it: 

 brew install python
brew install gfortran
brew install pkg-config
easy_install pip
pip install numpy
git clone https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib.git
cd matplotlib
python setup.py build
python setup.py install
