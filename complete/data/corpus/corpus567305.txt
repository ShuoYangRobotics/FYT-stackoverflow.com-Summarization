Question (ID-567305): What library do you use for graphs in Python? I like to know what libraries do you use for simple plot graphs? --Bar charts, line 
charts, pie charts ... Particularly in Python. 

 Thanks! 
 Answers (Total-9): #0 matplotlib 
 #1 You can also check out the Google Chart API: http://code.google.com/apis/chart/ 

 Perhaps with pygooglechart: http://pygooglechart.slowchop.com/ 

 It's simple to use in combination with urllib2 , but for anything heavy-duty you'll want to use a native package. 
 #2 Look at CairoPlot too. 
 #3 I'd say it depends on where you want to present it: 

 
 for scientific needs, use MatPlotLib 
 for presentations and websites, use CairoPlot 
 
 #4 DISLIN 
 #5 In this website http://www.dia.fi.upm.es/~jamartin/download.htm , you can see some excellent results using vpython 
 #6 I haven't done much python programming, but I took a physics class that used VPython for 2d and 3d graphics. The plotting facility is really easy to use, but it can't do pie charts. Check out the documentation for the graphing module. 
 #7 I have used matplotlib in the past, but i'm trying to get used to pgplot at the moment, which is technically a fortran module but there is a python-wrapped version ppgplot . 

 Also a C version cpgplot 
 #8 MathGL have large set of plot types and C/C++/Python/Fortran/Octave interfaces too.
