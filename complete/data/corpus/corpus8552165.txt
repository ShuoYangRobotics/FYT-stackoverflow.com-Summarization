Question (ID-8552165): Importing a python module without actually executing it In the context of a complex application, I need to import user-supplied 'scripts'. Ideally, a script would have 

 def init():
 blah

def execute():
 more blah

def cleanup():
 yadda
 

 so I'd just 

 import imp
fname, path, desc = imp.find_module(userscript)
foo = imp.load_module(userscript, fname, path, desc)
foo.init()
 

 However, as we all know, the user's script is executed as soon as load_module runs. 
Which means, a script can be something like this: 

 def init():
 blah

yadda
 

 yielding to the yadda part being called as soon as I import the script. 

 What I need is a way to: 

 
 check first whether it has init(), execute() and cleanup() 
 if they exist, all is well 
 if they don't exist, complain 
 don't run any other code, or at least not until I know there's no init() 
 

 Normally I'd force the use the same old if __name__ == '__main__' trick, but I have little control on the user-supplied script, so I'm looking for a relatively painless solution. I have seen all sorts of complicated tricks, including parsing the script, but nothing really simple. I'm surprised it does not exist.. or maybe I'm not getting something. 

 Thanks. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 My attempt using the ast module: 

 import ast

# which syntax elements are allowed at module level?
whitelist = [
 # docstring
 lambda x: isinstance(x, ast.Expr) \
    and isinstance(x.value, ast.Str),
 # import
 lambda x: isinstance(x, ast.Import),
 # class
 lambda x: isinstance(x, ast.ClassDef),
 # function
 lambda x: isinstance(x, ast.FunctionDef),
]

def validate(source, required_functions):
 tree = ast.parse(source)

 functions = set()
 required_functions = set(required_functions)

 for item in tree.body:
 if isinstance(item, ast.FunctionDef):
  functions.add(item.name)
  continue

 if all(not checker(item) for checker in whitelist):
  return False

 # at least the required functions must be there
 return len(required_functions - functions) == 0


if __name__ == "__main__":
 required_funcs = [ "init", "execute", "cleanup" ]
 with open("/tmp/test.py", "rb") as f:
 print("yay!" if validate(f.read(), required_funcs) else "d'oh!")
 
 #1 I'd first of all not require some functions, but a class that conforms to a specified interface, using either the abc module, or zope.interface . This forces the maker of the module to supply the functions you want. 

 Secondly, I would not bother looking for module-level code. It's the module-makers problem if he does this. It's too much work with no actual benefit. 

 If you are worried about security issues, you need to sandbox the code somehow anyway. 
 #2 Not sure if you'll consider this elegant, but it is somewhat intelligent in the sense that it recognizes when def init are tokens and not just part of a tricky multi-line string: 

 '''
def init does not define init...
'''
 

 It will not recognize when init is defined in tricky alternate ways such as 

 init = lambda ...
 

 or 

 codestr='def i'+'nit ...'
exec(codestr)
 

 The only way to handle all such cases is to run the code (e.g. in a sandbox or by importing) and inspect the result. 

 

 import tokenize
import token
import io
import collections

userscript = '''\
def init():
 blah

"""
def execute():
 more blah
"""

yadda
'''

class Token(object):
 def __init__(self, tok):
  toknum, tokval, (srow, scol), (erow, ecol), line = tok
  self.toknum = toknum
  self.tokname = token.tok_name[toknum]
  self.tokval = tokval
  self.srow = srow
  self.scol = scol
  self.erow = erow
  self.ecol = ecol
  self.line = line 

class Validator(object):
 def __init__(self, codestr):
  self.codestr = codestr
  self.toks = collections.deque(maxlen = 2)
  self.names = set()
 def validate(self):
  tokens = tokenize.generate_tokens(io.StringIO(self.codestr).readline)
  self.toks.append(Token(next(tokens)))
  for tok in tokens:
   self.toks.append(Token(tok))   
   if (self.toks[0].tokname == 'NAME'  # First token is a name
    and self.toks[0].scol == 0   # First token starts at col 0
    and self.toks[0].tokval == 'def' # First token is 'def'
    and self.toks[1].tokname == 'NAME' # Next token is a name
    ):
    self.names.add(self.toks[1].tokval)
  delta = set(['init', 'cleanup', 'execute']) - self.names
  if delta:
   raise ValueError('{n} not defined'.format(n = ' and '.join(delta)))

v = Validator(userscript)
v.validate()
 

 yields 

 ValueError: execute and cleanup not defined
 
 #3 Here's a simpler (and more naive) alternative to the AST approach: 

 import sys
from imp import find_module, new_module, PY_SOURCE


EXPECTED = ("init", "execute", "cleanup")

def import_script(name):
 fileobj, path, description = find_module(name)

 if description[2] != PY_SOURCE:
  raise ImportError("no source file found")

 code = compile(fileobj.read(), path, "exec")

 expected = list(EXPECTED)
 for const in code.co_consts:
  if isinstance(const, type(code)) and const.co_name in expected:
   expected.remove(const.co_name)
 if expected:
  raise ImportError("missing expected function: {}".format(expected))

 module = new_module(name)
 exec(code, module.__dict__)
 sys.modules[name] = module
 return module
 

 Keep in mind, this is a very direct way of doing it and circumvents extensions to Python's import machinery. 
 #4 One very simple solution could be to check the first characters of every line of code: The only permitted should be: 

 
 def init(): 
 def execute(): 
 def cleanup(): 
 lines starting with 4 spaces 
 [optionally]: lines starting with # 
 

 This is very primitive but it fulfills your requirements... 

 Update : After a second though about it I realized that it isn't so easy after all. Consider for example this piece of code: 

 def init():
 v = """abc
def
ghi"""
 print(v)
 

 This means that you'd need a more complex code parsing algorithm... so forget about my solution... 
 #5 A solution to 1 to 3, ( not the yadda part ) is to hand out "generic_class.py" with all the methods that you need. So, 

 class Generic(object):

 def __init__(self):
  return

 def execute(self):
  return

 # etc
 

 You can then check for the existence of "generic" in what you've imported. If it doesn't exist you can ignore it and if it does then you know exactly what's there. Anything extra will never be called unless it's called from within one of your pre-defined methods.
