Question (ID-1165352): Fast comparison between two Python dictionary Say i have two Python dictionaries - dictA and dictB. I need to find out if there are any keys which are present in dictB but not in dictA. Which is the fastest way to go about it.
Should i convert the dictionary keys into a set and then go about.. 

 Interested in knowing your thoughts... 

 

 Thanks for your responses. 

 Apologies for not stating my question properly.
My scenario is like this - i have a dictA which can be the same as dictB or may have some keys missing as compared to dictB or else the value of some keys might be different which has to be set to that of dictA key's value. 

 Problem is the dictionary has no standard and can have keys which can be dict of dict.... 

 Say 

 dictA={'key1':a, 'key2':b, 'key3':{'key11':cc, 'key12':dd}, 'key4':{'key111':{....}}}
dictB={'key1':a, 'key2:':newb, 'key3':{'key11':cc, 'key12':newdd, 'key13':ee}.......
 

 So 'key2' value has to be reset to the new value and 'key13' has to be added inside the dict.
The key value does not have a fixed format. It can be a simple value or a dict or a dict of dict.... 
 Answers (Total-8): #0 You can use set operations on the keys: 

 diff = set(dictb.keys()) - set(dicta.keys())
 

 Here is a class to find all the possibilities: what was added, what was removed, which key-value pairs are the same, and which key-value pairs are unchanged. 

 class DictDiffer(object):
 """
 Calculate the difference between two dictionaries as:
 (1) items added
 (2) items removed
 (3) keys same in both but changed values
 (4) keys same in both and unchanged values
 """
 def __init__(self, current_dict, past_dict):
 	self.current_dict, self.past_dict = current_dict, past_dict
 	self.set_current, self.set_past = set(current_dict.keys()), set(past_dict.keys())
 	self.intersect = self.set_current.intersection(self.set_past)
 def added(self):
 	return self.set_current - self.intersect 
 def removed(self):
 	return self.set_past - self.intersect 
 def changed(self):
 	return set(o for o in self.intersect if self.past_dict[o] != self.current_dict[o])
 def unchanged(self):
 	return set(o for o in self.intersect if self.past_dict[o] == self.current_dict[o])
 
 #1 As Alex Martelli wrote, if you simply want to check if any key in B is not in A, any(True for k in dictB if k not in dictA) would be the way to go. 

 To find the keys that are missing: 

 diff = set(dictB)-set(dictA) #sets
 

 C:\Dokumente und Einstellungen\thc>python -m timeit -s "dictA = dict(zip(range(1000),range
(1000))); dictB = dict(zip(range(0,2000,2),range(1000)))" "diff=set(dictB)-set(dictA)"
10000 loops, best of 3: 107 usec per loop 

 diff = [ k for k in dictB if k not in dictA ] #lc
 

 C:\Dokumente und Einstellungen\thc>python -m timeit -s "dictA = dict(zip(range(1000),range
(1000))); dictB = dict(zip(range(0,2000,2),range(1000)))" "diff=[ k for k in dictB if k no
t in dictA ]"
10000 loops, best of 3: 95.9 usec per loop 

 So those two solutions are pretty much the same speed. 
 #2 If you really mean exactly what you say (that you only need to find out IF "there are any keys" in B and not in A, not WHICH ONES might those be if any), the fastest way should be: 

 if any(True for k in dictB if k not in dictA): ...
 

 If you actually need to find out WHICH KEYS, if any, are in B and not in A, and not just "IF" there are such keys, then existing answers are quite appropriate (but I do suggest more precision in future questions if that's indeed what you mean;-). 
 #3 not sure whether its "fast" or not, but normally, one can do this 

 dicta = {"a":1,"b":2,"c":3,"d":4}
dictb = {"a":1,"d":2}
for key in dicta.keys():
 if not key in dictb:
  print key
 
 #4 Here's a way that will work, allows for keys that evaluate to False , and still uses a generator expression to fall out early if possible. It's not exceptionally pretty though. 

 any(map(lambda x: True, (k for k in b if k not in a)))
 

 EDIT: 

 THC4k posted a reply to my comment on another answer. Here's a better, prettier way to do the above: 

 any(True for k in b if k not in a)
 

 Not sure how that never crossed my mind... 
 #5 May not 100% fit your question - but you could dump the dictionaries to json and compare the resulting strings. ;-) 
 #6 Iff on Python â‰¥ 2.7: 

 # update different values in dictB
# I would assume only dictA should be updated,
# but the question specifies otherwise

for k in dictA.viewkeys() &amp; dictB.viewkeys():
 if dictA[k] != dictB[k]:
  dictB[k]= dictA[k]

# add missing keys to dictA

dictA.update( (k,dictB[k]) for k in dictB.viewkeys() - dictA.viewkeys() )
 
 #7 what about standart (compare FULL Object)
