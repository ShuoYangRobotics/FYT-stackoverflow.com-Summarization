Question (ID-3232953): Python: Removing spaces from list objects I have a list of objects appended from a mysql database and contain spaces. I wish to remove the spaces such as below, but the code im using doesnt work? 

 hello = ['999 ',' 666 ']

k = []

for i in hello:
 str(i).replace(' ','')
 k.append(i)

print k
 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Strings in Python are immutable (meaning that their data cannot be modified) so the replace method doesn't modify the string - it returns a new string. You could fix your code as follows: 

 for i in hello:
 j = i.replace(' ','')
 k.append(j)
 

 However a better way to achieve your aim is to use a list comprehension. For example the following code removes leading and trailing spaces from every string in the list using strip : 

 hello = [x.strip(' ') for x in hello]
 
 #1 hello = ['999 ', '666 ']
result = map(lambda x: x.strip(), hello)
 
 #2 String methods return the modified string. 

 k = [x.replace(' ', '') for x in hello]
 
 #3 List comprehension [num.strip() for num in hello] is the fastest. 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; import timeit
&gt;&gt;&gt; hello = ['999 ',' 666 ']

&gt;&gt;&gt; t1 = lambda: map(str.strip, hello)
&gt;&gt;&gt; timeit.timeit(t1)
1.825870468015296

&gt;&gt;&gt; t2 = lambda: list(map(str.strip, hello))
&gt;&gt;&gt; timeit.timeit(t2)
2.2825958750515269

&gt;&gt;&gt; t3 = lambda: [num.strip() for num in hello]
&gt;&gt;&gt; timeit.timeit(t3)
1.4320335103944899

&gt;&gt;&gt; t4 = lambda: [num.replace(' ', '') for num in hello]
&gt;&gt;&gt; timeit.timeit(t4)
1.7670568718943969
 
 #4 replace() does not operate in-place, you need to assign its result to something. Also, for a more concise syntax, you could supplant your for loop with a one-liner: hello_no_spaces = map(lambda x: x.replace(' ', ''), hello) 
 #5 Presuming that you don't want to remove internal spaces: 

 def normalize_space(s):
 """Return s stripped of leading/trailing whitespace
 and with internal runs of whitespace replaced by a single SPACE"""
 # This should be a str method :-(
 return ' '.join(s.split())

replacement = [normalize_space(i) for i in hello]
