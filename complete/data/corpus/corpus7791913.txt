Question (ID-7791913): syntaxerror: "unexpected character after line continuation character in python" math I am having problems with this Python program I am creating to do maths, working out and so solutions but I'm getting the syntaxerror: "unexpected character after line continuation character in python" 

 this is my code 

 print("Length between sides: "+str((length*length)*2.6)+" \ 1.5 = "+str(((length*length)*2.6)\1.5)+" Units")
 

 My problem is with \1.5 I have tried \1.5 but it doesn't work 

 Using python 2.7.2 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 The division operator is / , not \ 
 #1 The backslash \ is the line continuation character the error message is talking about, and after it, only newline characters/whitespace are allowed (before the next non-whitespace continues the "interrupted" line. 

 print "This is a very long string that doesn't fit" + \
  "on a single line"
 

 Outside of a string, a backslash can only appear in this way. For division, you want a slash: / . 

 If you want to write a verbatim backslash in a string, escape it by doubling it: "\\" 

 In your code, you're using it twice: 

 print("Length between sides: " + str((length*length)*2.6) +
  " \ 1.5 = " +     # inside a string; treated as literal
  str(((length*length)*2.6)\1.5)+ # outside a string, treated as line cont
          # character, but no newline follows -&gt; Fail
  " Units")
 
 #2 The division operator is / rather than \ . 

 Also, the backslash has a special meaning inside a Python string. Either escape it with another backslash: 

 "\\ 1.5 = "`
 

 or use a raw string 

 r" \ 1.5 = "
 
 #3 Well, what do you try to do? If you want to use division, use "/" not "\".
If it is something else, explain it in a bit more detail, please. 
 #4 As the others already mentioned: the division operator is / rather than * * .
If you wanna print the * * character within a string you have to escape it: 

 print("foo \\")
# will print: foo \
 

 I think to print the string you wanted I think you gonna need this code: 

 print("Length between sides: " + str((length*length)*2.6) + " \\ 1.5 = " + str(((length*length)*2.6)/1.5) + " Units")
 

 And this one is a more readable version of the above (using the format method): 

 message = "Length between sides: {0} \\ 1.5 = {1} Units"
val1 = (length * length) * 2.6
val2 = ((length * length) * 2.6) / 1.5
print(message.format(val1, val2))
 
 #5 print ("Length between sides: \"+str((length*length)*2.6)+\" \ 1.5 = \"+str(((length*length)*2.6)\1.5)+\" Units")
 

 This works for me.. if it's a string u want to print..
