 Full-featured web frameworks like Django - making basic web development really easy. 
 PyQt - binding the full power of the Qt framework to Python 
 Pygame - easy and fun game development 
 matplotlib - publication-quality scientific plots for any purpose 
 
 #1 Sage : "Sage is a free open-source mathematics software system licensed under the GPL. It combines the power of many existing open-source packages into a common Python-based interface." 
 #2 Pyjamas (PyJS) - Unified web and GUI framework with all components being done in native python (no more annoying JS). 
 #3 Reportlab - Programatic creation of PDFs. 

 I second all of Eli's suggestions, all realy excellent stuff especially PyQt and PySide .
