Question (ID-4941164): Checking if x>y without if statement In Python, is it possible to check whether x>y without using the if statement? 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 There are a variety of ways to go about this: 

 print "yes" if x &gt; y else "no"
 

 or: 

 print ["no", "yes"][x &gt; y]
 

 or: 

 print x &gt; y and "yes" or "no"
 

 (at least, this is what my mind-reading powers think that you're doing) 
 #1 &gt;&gt;&gt; x=1
&gt;&gt;&gt; y=2
&gt;&gt;&gt; "YNEOS"[x&lt;y::2]
'NO'
&gt;&gt;&gt; x=3
&gt;&gt;&gt; "YNEOS"[x&lt;y::2]
'YES'
 
 #2 Yes: 

 x &gt; y
 

 This returns true if x is larger than y, and there is no if statement involved. 
 #3 The question is really vague. You could check if x is greater than y in a while loop, or you could use the expression to return a boolean or whatever. 

 It would be a lot easier to answer if you gave us an example of what you're trying to achieve. 
 #4 This question is awful, but I suppose I'll contribute an answer anyway: 

 bool(x&gt;y)
 
 #5 Using loop while: 

 while (x &gt; y):
 print "yes"
 break
else:
 print "no"
 
 #6 you can try 

 x &gt; y
 

 or 

 bool(x&gt;y)
 

 in the second case bool are unecessary, in two codes true or false are returned, however, no checks by the return are performed, and this is your question. NOT, a if statement have a identical translation in hardware and to perform an test (if) in hardware you realy need to use if or an most high level statment
