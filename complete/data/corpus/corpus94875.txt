Question (ID-94875): Image Processing, In Python? I've recently come across a problem which requires at least a basic degree of image processing, can I do this in Python, and if so, with what? 
 Answers (Total-9): #0 The best-known library is PIL . However if you are simply doing basic manipulation, you are probably better off with the Python bindings for ImageMagick , which will be a good deal more efficient than writing the transforms in Python. 
 #1 You also have an approach to image processing based on "standard" scientific modules: SciPy has a whole package dedicated to image processing: scipy.ndimage . Scipy is in effect the standard general numerical calculations package; it is based on the de facto standard array-manipulation module NumPy : images can also be manipulated as array of numbers. As for image display, Matplotlib (also part of the "science trilogy") makes displaying images quite simple . 

 SciPy is still actively maintained, so it's a good investment for the future. Furthermore, SciPy currently runs with Python 3 too, while the Python Imaging Library (PIL) does not. 
 #2 Depending on what you mean by "image processing", a better choice might be in the numpy based libraries: mahotas , scikits.image , or scipy.ndimage . All of these work based on numpy arrays, so you can mix and match functions from one library and another. 

 I started the website http://pythonvision.org which has more information on these. 
 #3 There is actually a wonderful Python Imaging Library (PIL) . It gives you the ability to alter existing images, including anti-aliasing capabilities, and create new images with text and such. You can also find a decent introductory tutorial in the PIL handbook provided on the aforementioned site. 
 #4 There's also pycairo , which might be more suitable depending on your needs. 
 #5 If you are creating a custom image processing effect, you may find PythonPixels useful.

It is intended for writing and experimenting with image processing.

 #7 I have done some basic image processing in PIL. You can check it out on my blog

 #8 VIPS should be fast and uses multiple CPUs:
