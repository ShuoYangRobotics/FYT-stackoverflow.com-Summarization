Question (ID-42482): Best way to extract text from a Word doc without using COM/automation? Is there a reasonable way to extract plain text from a Word file that doesn't depend on COM automation? (This is a a feature for a web app deployed on a non-Windows platform - that's non-negotiable in this case.) 

 Antiword seems like it might be a reasonable option, but it seems like it might be abandoned. 

 A Python solution would be ideal, but doesn't appear to be available. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 I use catdoc or antiword for this, whatever gives the result that is the easiest to parse. I have embedded this in python functions, so it is easy to use from the parsing system (which is written in python). 

 import os

def doc_to_text_catdoc(filename):
 (fi, fo, fe) = os.popen3('catdoc -w "%s"' % filename)
 fi.close()
 retval = fo.read()
 erroroutput = fe.read()
 fo.close()
 fe.close()
 if not erroroutput:
  return retval
 else:
  raise OSError("Executing the command caused an error: %s" % erroroutput)

# similar doc_to_text_antiword()
 

 The -w switch to catdoc turns off line wrapping, BTW. 
 #1 Open Office has an API 
 #2 Using the OpenOffice API, and Python, and Andrew Pitonyak's excellent online macro book I managed to do this. Section 7.16.4 is the place to start. 

 One other tip to make it work without needing the screen at all is to use the Hidden property: 

 RO = PropertyValue('ReadOnly', 0, True, 0)
Hidden = PropertyValue('Hidden', 0, True, 0)
xDoc = desktop.loadComponentFromURL( docpath,"_blank", 0, (RO, Hidden,) )
 

 Otherwise the document flicks up on the screen (probably on the webserver console) when you open it.

 Use the native Python docx module which I made this week. Here's how to extract all the text from a doc: 

 document = opendocx('Hello world.docx')

# This location is where most document content lives 
docbody = document.xpath('/w:document/w:body', namespaces=wordnamespaces)[0]

# Extract all text
print getdocumenttext(document)
 

 See http://github.com/mikemaccana/python-docx 

 100% Python, no COM, no .net, no Java, no parsing serialized XML with regexs, no crap. 
 #4 For docx files, check out the Python script docx2txt available at 

 http://cobweb.ecn.purdue.edu/~kak/distMisc/docx2txt 

 for extracting the plain text from a docx document. 
 #5 If it is Word 2007 docx, you could unzip it and parse the XML files that are contained inside.
