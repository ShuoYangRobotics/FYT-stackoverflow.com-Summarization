Question (ID-2055738): Help with Python strings I have a program which reads commands from a text file 

 for example, the command syntax will be as follows and is a string 

 'index command param1 param2 param3' 

 The number of parameters is variable from 0 up to 3
index is an integer
command is a string
all the params are integers 

 I would like to split them so that I have a list as follows 

 [index,'command',params[]] 

 What is the best way to do this? 

 Thanks 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 Not sure if it's the best way, but here's one way: 

 lines = open('file.txt')
for line in lines:
 as_list = line.split()
 result = [as_list[0], as_list[1], as_list[2:]]
 print result
 

 Result will contain 

 ['index', 'command', ['param1', 'param2', 'param3']]
 
 #1 def add_command(index, command, *params):
 index = int(index)
 #do what you need to with index, command and params here

with open('commands.txt') as f:
 for line in f:
  add_command(*line.split())
 
 #2 i typically write: 

 lines = open('a.txt').readlines()
for line in lines:
 para = lines.split()
 index = int(para[0])
 command = para[1]
 para1 = float(para[2])
 ...
 
 #3 
 Open the file 
 Read each line and parse the line via line.split( ) 
 
 #4 &gt;&gt;&gt; for line in open("file"):
...  line=line.rstrip().split(" ",2)
...  line[0]=int(line[0])
...  line[2]=line[2].split()
...  print line
...
[1, 'command', ['param1', 'param2', 'param3']]
 
 #5 If you use Python 3+ , then following should be enough as indicated in PEP 3132: Extended Iterable Unpacking : 

 (index,command,*parameters) = line.split()
 

 

 Otherwise, I like solution from James best: 

 def add_command(index, command, *params):
 ...
 
 #6 The Answer provided by cb160 is correct and smart way, But, I did it in this way.
In cb160 's code, Only thing is index should be in Integer format, as you have mentioned. 

 In my below code, I added exceptions for empty lines in input file if there are any. 

 #Example Input File: (file content)
"""
1 command1 parm1a parm1b parm1c
2 command2 parm2a parm2b parm2c

3 command3 parm3a parm3b parm3c

"""

li = []

for line in open('list_of_commands.txt'):
 try:
 lis = line.split()
 li.append([int(lis[0]),lis[1], lis[2:]])
 except IndexError:
 pass # do nothing if empty lines are found

print li
 

 Output 

 [1, 'command1', ['parm1a', 'parm1b', 'parm1c']]
[2, 'command2', ['parm2a', 'parm2b', 'parm2c']]
[3, 'command3', ['parm3a', 'parm3b', 'parm3c']]
 

 let me know if I missed anything. 

 Thanks
