Question (ID-431205): How can I programatically change the background in Mac OS X? How would I go about programatically changing the desktop background in Mac OS X? I'd like to use python, but I'm interested in any way possible. Could I hook up to Terminal and call a certain command? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 From python, if you have appscript installed ( sudo easy_install appscript ), you can simply do 

 from appscript import app, mactypes
app('Finder').desktop_picture.set(mactypes.File('/your/filename.jpg'))
 

 Otherwise, this applescript will change the desktop background 

 tell application "Finder"
 set desktop picture to POSIX file "/your/filename.jpg"
end tell
 

 You can run it from the command line using osascript , or from Python using something like 

 import subprocess

SCRIPT = """/usr/bin/osascript&lt;&lt;END
tell application "Finder"
set desktop picture to POSIX file "%s"
end tell
END"""

def set_desktop_background(filename):
 subprocess.Popen(SCRIPT%filename, shell=True)
 
 #1 You can call "defaults write com.apple.Desktop Background ..." as described in this article: http://thingsthatwork.net/index.php/2008/02/07/fun-with-os-x-defaults-and-launchd/ 

 The article also goes into scripting this to run automatically, but the first little bit should get you started. 

 You might also be interested in the defaults man pages: http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/defaults.1.html 
 #2 If you are doing this for the current user, you can run, from a shell: 

 defaults write com.apple.desktop Background '{default = {ImageFilePath = "/Library/Desktop Pictures/Black &amp; White/Lightning.jpg"; };}'
 

 Or, as root, for another user: 

 /usr/bin/defaults write /Users/joeuser/Library/Preferences/com.apple.desktop Background '{default = {ImageFilePath = "/Library/Desktop Pictures/Black &amp; White/Lightning.jpg"; };}'
chown joeuser /Users/joeuser/Library/Preferences/com.apple.desktop.plist
 

 You will of course want to replace the image filename and user name. 

 The new setting will take effect when the Dock starts up -- either at login, or, when you 

 killall Dock
 

 [Based on a posting elsewhere , and based on information from Matt Miller's answer .] 
 #3 To add to Matt Miller's response : you can use subprocess.call() to execute a shell command as so: 

 import subprocess
subprocess.call(["defaults", "write", "com.apple.Desktop", "background", ...])
 
 #4 I had this same question, except that I wanted to change the wallpaper on all attached monitors. Here's a Python script using appscript (mentioned above; sudo easy_install appscript ) which does just that. 

 from appscript import *

f = '/path/to/your/file.jpg'
se = app('System Events')
desktops = se.desktops.display_name.get()
for d in desktops:
 desk = se.desktops[its.display_name == d]
 desk.picture.set(mactypes.File(f))
 
 #5 You could also use py-appscript instead of Popening osascript or use ScriptingBridge with pyobjc which is included in 10.5 but a bit more cumbersome to use.
