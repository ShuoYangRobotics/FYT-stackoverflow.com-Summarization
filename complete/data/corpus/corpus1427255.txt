Question (ID-1427255): Is there a Python caching library? I'm looking for a Python caching library but can't find anything so far. I need a simple dict -like interface where I can set keys and their expiration and get them back cached. Sort of something like: 

 cache.get(myfunction, duration=300)
 

 which will give me the item from the cache if it exists or call the function and store it if it doesn't or has expired. Does anyone know something like this?

 #1 I think the python memcached API is the prevalent tool, but I haven't used it myself and am not sure whether it supports the features you need. 
 #2 import time

class CachedItem(object):
 def __init__(self, key, value, duration=60):
  self.key = key
  self.value = value
  self.duration = duration
  self.timeStamp = time.time()

 def __repr__(self):
  return '&lt;CachedItem {%s:%s} expires at: %s&gt;' % (self.key, self.value, time.time() + self.duration)

class CachedDict(dict):

 def get(self, key, fn, duration):
  if key not in self \
   or self[key].timeStamp + self[key].duration &lt; time.time():
    print 'adding new value'
    o = fn(key)
    self[key] = CachedItem(key, o, duration)
  else:
   print 'loading from cache'

  return self[key].value



if __name__ == '__main__':

 fn = lambda key: 'value of %s is None' % key

 ci = CachedItem('a', 12)
 print ci 
 cd = CachedDict()
 print cd.get('a', fn, 5)
 time.sleep(2)
 print cd.get('a', fn, 6)
 print cd.get('b', fn, 6)
 time.sleep(2)
 print cd.get('a', fn, 7)
 print cd.get('b', fn, 7)
 
 #3 You might also take a look at the Memoize decorator . You could probably get it to do what you want without too much modification. 
 #4 Try redis, it is one of the cleanest and easiest solutions for applications to share data in a atomic way or if you have got some web server platform. Its very easy to setup, you will need a python redis client http://pypi.python.org/pypi/redis 
 #5 Look at gocept.cache 
 #6 Look at bda.cache http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bda.cache - uses ZCA and is tested with zope and bfg.
