Question (ID-3486384): Output first 100 characters in a string Can seem to find a substring function in python. 

 Say I want to output the first 100 characters in a string, how can I do this? 

 I want to do it safely also, meaing if the string is 50 characters it shouldn't fail. 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 Easy: 

 print mystring[:100]
 
 #1 From python tutorial : 

 
 Degenerate slice indices are handled
 gracefully: an index that is too large
 is replaced by the string size , an
 upper bound smaller than the lower
 bound returns an empty string. 
 

 So it is safe to use x[:100] . 
 #2 print my_string[0:100]
 
 #3 Slicing and dicing sequences (including strings) is an important part of Python. The following resources will come in handy: 

 
 http://docs.python.org/tutorial/introduction.html 
 http://diveintopython.org/native_data_types/lists.html 
 
 #4 substr = string[:100]
 
 #5 Slicing of arrays is done with [start:end+1] . 

 One trick I tend to use a lot of is to indicate extra information with ellipses. So, if your field is one hundred characters, I would use: 

 if len(s) &lt;= 100:
 print s
else:
 print "%s..."%(s[:97]) # Yes, I know () is superfluous, it's just my style.
 
 #6 To answer Philipp's concern ( in the comments ), slicing works ok for unicode strings too 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; greek=u"αβγδεζηθικλμνξοπρςστυφχψω"
&gt;&gt;&gt; print len(greek)
25
&gt;&gt;&gt; print greek[:10]
αβγδεζηθικ
 

 If you want to run the above code as a script, put this line at the top 

 # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
 

 If your editor doesn't save in utf-8, substitute the correct encoding
