Question (ID-4286419): What third-party libraries are the biggest show stoppers for Python 3.x? One of the main obstacles preventing people from moving to Python 3 are third-party libraries which have not yet been ported. What library is the biggest show stopper for you? 

 
 One library per answer please 
 I will flag this post to be made a community wiki since answering takes very little effort and upvoting shall mean "I'm waiting for this lib as well" and not "Wow, great answer!"
