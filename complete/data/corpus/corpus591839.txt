Question (ID-591839): Is there a python equivalent of the prefuse visualization toolkit? The prefuse visualization toolkit is pretty nice, but for Java. I was wondering if there was something similar for python. My primary interest is being able to navigate dynamic graphs. 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 I know this is not exactly python, but you could use prefuse in python through jython 

 Something along the lines of: 

 Add prefuse to your path: 

 export JYTHONPATH=$JYTHONPATH:prefuse.jar 

 and 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; import prefuse 

 from your jython machinery 

 this guy has an example of using prefuse from jython here 
 #1 You might want to check out SUMMON , a visualization system that uses python but handles fairly large data sets. There's an impressive video of visualizing and navigating a massive tree. (Can't post the link because I'm a first time poster. It's on the SUMMON front page.) 
 #2 If you're using a Mac, check out NodeBox . One extension it offers is a graph library that looks pretty good. Poke around in the NodeBox gallery some to find something similar to your problem and it should have some helpful links. 
 #3 This is well after OP, but just in case: 

 pydot . Allows generation &amp; rendering of graphs. If you need graph algorithms (transitive closure etc.) also look at pygraphlib which extends and integrates pydot. 

 Note that neither allows interactive editing of the rendered diagram. They both use graphviz to generate output. 
 #4 Note that prefuse now has the flare package which uses flash. 

 Connect that to a Python backend via web2py and you've got a great web app (just an idea). 
 #5 You could try using prefuse with JPype , if you can't find a suitable replacement.
