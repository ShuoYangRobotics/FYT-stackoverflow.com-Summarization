Question (ID-4283639): check files for equality what's the most elegant way to check to files for equality in Python?
Checksum? Bytes comparing? Think files wont' be larger than 100-200 MB 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 What about filecmp module? It can do file comparison in many different ways with different tradeoffs. 

 And even better, it is part of the standard library: 

 http://docs.python.org/library/filecmp.html 
 #1 Ok, this might need two separate answers. 

 If you have many files to compare, go for the checksum and cache the checksum for each file. To be sure, compare matching files byte for byte afterwards. 

 If you have only two files, go directly for byte comparison because you have to read the file anyway to compute the checksum. 

 In both cases, use the file size as an early way of checking for inequality. 
 #2 use hashlib to get the md5 of each file, and compare the results. 

 #! /bin/env python
import hashlib
def filemd5(filename, block_size=2**20):
 f = open(filename)
 md5 = hashlib.md5()
 while True:
  data = f.read(block_size)
  if not data:
   break
  md5.update(data)
 f.close()
 return md5.digest()

if __name__ == "__main__":
 a = filemd5('/home/neo/todo')
 b = filemd5('/home/neo/todo2')
 print(a == b)
 

 

 Update: As of Python 2.1 there is a filecmp module that does just what you want, and has methods to compare directories too. I never knew about this module, I'm still learning Python myself :-) 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; import filecmp
&gt;&gt;&gt; filecmp.cmp('undoc.rst', 'undoc.rst')
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; filecmp.cmp('undoc.rst', 'index.rst')
False
 
 #3 Before attempting any of the other solutions, you might want to do os.path.getsize(...) on both files.
If that differs, there is no need to compare bytes or calculate checksum. 

 Of course, this only helps if the filesize isn't fixed. 

 Example: 

 def foo(f1, f2):
 if not os.path.getsize(f1) == os.path.getsize(f2):
  return False # Or similar

 ... # Checksumming / byte-comparing / whatever
 
 #4 I would do checksum with MD5 (for example) instead of byte comaprasion plus the date check and depend on you needs name check. 
 #5 What about shelling out to cmp ? 

 import commands
status, output = commands.getstatusoutput("/usr/bin/cmp file1 file2")
if (status == 0):
 print "files are same"
elif (status == 1):
 print "files differ"
else:
 print "uh oh!"
