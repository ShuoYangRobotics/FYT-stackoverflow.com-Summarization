Question (ID-4167217): even numbers python list Working on an assignment. Can anyone help me get started by explaining how i can create a list and only extract or search out the even numbers in that list? 

 create a function even_only(l) that takes a list of integers as its only argument. The
function will return a new list containing all (and only) the elements of l which are evenly divisible by 2. The original list l shall remain unchanged. 

 For examples, even_only([1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28]) should return [6, 10, 28], and
even_only([1, 4, 9, 16, 25]) should return [4, 16]. 

 Hint: Start by creating an empty list, and whenever you encounter an even number in l, add it to your list. At the end, return your list. 

 Thanks for your tme in explaining :) 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Simplest way would be to do what you posted in a comment -- iterate through the input list to find digits evenly divisible by 2, and add them to the return list if so. 

 The list.append(x) function will help you add an item to a list. 

 Also as mentioned, look at using the modulo operation to determine if a number is divisible by 2... 
 #1 "By hand": 

 def even_only(lst):
 evens = []
 for number in lst:
  if is_even(number):
   evens.append(number)
 return evens
 

 Pythonic: 

 def even_only(iter):
 return [x for x in iter if is_even(x)]
 

 Since it's homework, you can fill in the is_even function. 
 #2 The best way to do this (as a beginner) is probably a comprehension list. Since this is a homework, I won't do it for you, but here is the syntax : 

 [x for x in your_list if (your condition)]
 

 You just have to replace (your condition) with what fits well (basically, exactly what you described). 

 P.S. I know some people may say comprehension lists are a bit advanced for a beginner, but I think it is not a concept too hard to catch and extremely useful. 
 #3 &gt;&gt;&gt; even_only = lambda seq : [ x for x in seq if str(x)[-1] in "02468" ]
&gt;&gt;&gt; even_only([1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28])
[6, 10, 28]
 
 #4 Use the filter function to do this in a functional way: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; even_filter = lambda x: not x % 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; result = filter(even_filter, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
&gt;&gt;&gt; assert result == [0, 2, 4]
 

 Edit: updated with the correct parity of zero per Vincent's comment. 
 #5 &gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = [i for i in a if i%2 ==0 ]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b
[6, 10, 28]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
[1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28]
