Question (ID-717541): Parsing HTML in Python What's my best bet for parsing HTML if I can't use BeautifulSoup or lxml? I've got some code that uses SGMLlib but it's a bit low-level and it's now deprecated. 

 I would prefer if it could stomache a bit of malformed HTML although I'm pretty sure most of the input will be pretty clean. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Python has a native HTML parser , however the Tidy wrapper Nick suggested would probably be a solid choice as well. Tidy is a very common library, (written in C is it?) 
 #1 Why can't you use BeautifulSoup? It's a simple one-file python-module, so if you don't get it "installed", just copy-and-paste it's contents into your actual script. 
 #2 Perhaps ÂµTidylib will meet your needs?

 I don't have much experience with python, but I have used Xerces (from the Apache foundation) in the past and found it to be very useful. The learning curve isn't bad either, though I'm not coming from a python perspective. I suggest you consider it though. (The first two links I've included discuss python interfaces to Xerces and the last one is the first google hit on "python xml").
