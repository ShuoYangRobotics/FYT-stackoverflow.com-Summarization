Question (ID-260738): Play audio with python How can i play audio (it would be like a 1sec sound) from a python script? 

 It would be best if it was platform independent, but first of it needs to work on a mac. 

 I know i could just execute the 'afplay file.mp3' command from within python, but is it possible to do it in raw python? I would also be better if it diddnt rely on external libraries. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Your best bet is probably to use pygame/SDL . It's an external library, but it has great support across platforms. 
 #1 You can find information about Python audio here: http://wiki.python.org/moin/Audio/ 

 It doesn't look like it can play .mp3 files without external libraries. You could either convert your .mp3 file to a .wav or other format, or use a library like PyMedia . 
 #2 Also most of the modern GUI toolkits (wx, QT ...) have some sort of multimedia support 
 #3 Pyglet has the ability to play back audio through an external library called AVbin . Pyglet is a ctypes wrapper around native system calls on each platform it supports. Unfortunately, I don't think anything in the standard library will play audio back. 
 #4 You can't do this without a nonstandard library. 

 for windows users who end up in this thread, try pythonwin . PyGame has some sound support. For hardware accelerated game audio, you'll probably need to call OpenAL or similar through ctypes. 
 #5 If you need portable Python audio library try PyAudio . It certainly has a mac port. 

 As for mp3 files: it's certainly doable in "raw" Python, only I'm afraid you'd have to code everything yourself :). If you can afford some external library I've found some PyAudio - PyLame sample here.
