Question (ID-5306582): Newbie "Hello World" Python Question I'm very new to python, and when I try a simple Hello World, and after trying every combination I get this: 

 Python 3.2 (r32:88445, Feb 20 2011, 21:30:00) [MSC v.1500 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "copyright", "credits" or "license()" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Print ("Hello World")
Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "&lt;pyshell#0&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
 Print ("Hello World")
NameError: name 'Print' is not defined
&gt;&gt;&gt; Print ('Hello World')
Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "&lt;pyshell#1&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
 Print ('Hello World')
NameError: name 'Print' is not defined
&gt;&gt;&gt; Print("Hello World")
Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "&lt;pyshell#2&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
 Print("Hello World")
NameError: name 'Print' is not defined
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
 

 What am I doing wrong? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Function and keyword names are case-sensitive in Python. Looks like you typed Print where you meant print . 
 #1 Python is case sensitive. 

 print('Hello World') 
 #2 It's not Print it's print . Lowercase p. 
 #3 It seems that your "Print" has got the wrong casing. print should be in lowercase 
 #4 What you are doing wrong?
Inventing new syntax - there is no documentation telling you to use Print instead of print. 
 #5 Print is nothing in python. 

 You mean print . 

 
I think you need to remove the space between print and ("Hello World") 

 You mean print("Hello World") 

 
Final code: print("Hello World")
