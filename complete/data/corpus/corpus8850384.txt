Question (ID-8850384): Concatenating text string and int from array Right I am a complete beginner here, trying to work through various python tutorials and a lot of them are great. However none of them have much of a consolidated approach to learning, where one skill builds on another. They all seem to show you things in silo. All I am trying to do is concatenate a string with an integer that is held in an array. Here is the code: 

 text = 'product_price_'
numberArray = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]


for i in numberArray:
 print text + str(numberArray[i])
 

 This kind of works, giving me the result: 

 product_price_2
product_price_3
product_price_4
product_price_5
product_price_6
product_price_7
product_price_8
product_price_9
product_price_10
Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "/Users/me/Documents/Programming/python/eclipse/workspace/concat.py", line 8, in &lt;module&gt;
print text + str(numberArray[i])
IndexError: list index out of range
 

 Like I say this is really simple stuff. I can concatenate, I can print an array but do both?? 

 Can anyone plug this gap in my knowledge for me? 

 Thanks 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 i contains the value from the array, not the index. So if you want to concatenate the value, try this: 

 for i in numberArray:
 print text + str(i)
 
 #1 Long story short: 

 text = 'product_price'
numberArray = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

for num in numberArray:
 print '_'.join((text, str(num)))
 

 Long story long: 

 - Step 1 

 You should not confuse the index with the value. You're example "kind of worked" because you stored numbers in you array (which by the way is a list ), but since the index numeration start with 0 you skipped the first element and found your list index out of range after the last one. 

 This is a fix for your example 

 text = 'product_price_'
numberArray = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

for i in numberArray:
 print text + str(i)
 

 - Step 2 

 Try storing string in your list and maybe something will be more clear: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; text = 'product_price '
&gt;&gt;&gt; my_list = ['one', 'two', 'three']
&gt;&gt;&gt; for price in my_list:
...  print text + price
product_price one
product_price two
product_price three
 

 In python it's really not necessary to get the value from its index, so you should not be doing : 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; text = 'product_price '
&gt;&gt;&gt; my_list = ['one', 'two', 'three']
&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(len(my_list)):
...  print text + my_list[i]
product_price one
product_price two
product_price three
 

 - Step 3 

 The last step is to concatenate strings using str.join() , in most of the case this will be more efficent: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; text = 'product_price' # without the underscore at the end
&gt;&gt;&gt; numberArray = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
&gt;&gt;&gt; for num in numberArray:
...  print '_'.join((text, str(num)))
product_price_1
product_price_2
product_price_3
[...]
 
 #2 You may want this code 

 for i in range(len(numberArray)):
 print text + str( numberArray[i] )
 
 #3 You could use a list comprehension: 

 [text + str(i) for i in numberArray]
 

 Or even shorter: 

 [text + str(i) for i in range(11)]
 

 to get rid of the number list (it's a list, not an array). 

 Another way is to use map : 

 map(lambda i: b + str(i), a)
 
 #4 Maybe what you want is 

 for i in numberArray:

 print text + str(i)
 

 When using 'in' operator, array elements are cycled through and not indexes.
And array indexes start with 0 and not 1.
eg 

 numberArray[0] = 1

numberArray[1] = 2

numberArray[9] = 10
 

 If you insist on using indexes for this example,
Your array should change to 

 numberArray = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] 
 #5 You want to loop on the indeces of numberArray: 

 for i in xrange(len(numberArray)):
 print text + str(numberArray[i])
 

 then i takes values 0 to 9, and your list-index will not be out of range. 

 The function xrange gives you an itearator on the range 0,...,len(numberArray) - 1. Since the length of numberArray is 10 you have an iterator from 0 to 9.
