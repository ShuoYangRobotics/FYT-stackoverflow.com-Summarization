Question (ID-2192799): Html to image in javascript or python Just a dumb question...
Is there any way you can create an image, say png, with the content of an html page, with a simple click of a button? 

 Thanks to anyone who cares to answers.

 It requires webkit, xvfb (or X) and Qt4, and works best on Ubuntu.

 #2 Thanks for you answers. But what I wanted was some code in javascript or python that would allow me to create an image from a table or div. 
 #3 If you're not locked to having it as a PNG, you could turn it into a PDF with Pisa/Report Lab (http://www.xhtml2pdf.com/). It handles tables pretty well. 
 #4 There is a service called Webthumb at http://webthumb.bluga.net/home that I have used for something similar. 

 It has a fairly easy REST interface for you to work upon. 
 #5 There is a service with the name sitethumbshot.com. Its pretty good service and easy to integrate. 
 #6 You can take a look at CutyCapt as well - http://cutycapt.sourceforge.net/
