Question (ID-989739): How to write a proxy server in Python? I want to write a program that changes the HTTP headers in my requests that are sent by my web-browser. I believe it can be done with a proxy server. So, I'd like to write a proxy server. 

 I study programming. How can I do this in Python? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Look at the Twisted framework , particularly Twisted Web . It's all freely available under MIT, so you can build off and/or modify it. 

 See also Python Twisted Examples . 
 #1 Good example below on how to do this without the overhead of a framework.

 #2 While Twisted, as recommended by @Matthew, is awesome, easier to learn, understand and modify might be this tiny example -- far away from the "production quality" and scalability that Twisted can offer, but, you could start with it to understand the issues better. 

 For a wide variety of open-source HTTP proxies written in Python, I recommend this list -- that reference has proxies for all tastes built on top of threading, Twisted, asyncore, and other technologies yet! 
 #3 Have a look at Tiny HTTP Proxy (1) and of course the related docs (2). It's basically running a server and handling requests.

 #4 WSGI may be a little easier to get your head around. So I'll throw paste.proxy out there either as something to build on or as a reference.

 Great library for any networking needs.
