Question (ID-53428): What are some good Python ORM solutions? I'm evaluating and looking at using CherryPy for a project that's basically a javascript front-end from the client-side (browser) that talks to a Python web service on the back-end. So, I really need something fast and lightweight on the back-end that I can implement using Python that then speaks to the PostgreSQL db via an ORM (JSON to the browser). 

 I'm also looking at Django, which I like, since its ORM is built-in. However, I think Django might be a little more than I really need (i.e. more features than I really need == slower?). 

 Anyone have any experience with different Python ORM solutions that can compare and contrast their features and functionality, speed, efficiency, etc.? 
 Answers (Total-13): #0 SQLAlchemy is more full-featured and powerful (uses the DataMapper pattern). Django ORM has a cleaner syntax and is easier to write for (ActiveRecord pattern). I don't know about performance differences. 

 SQLAlchemy also has a declarative layer that hides some complexity and gives it a ActiveRecord-style syntax more similar to the Django ORM. 

 I wouldn't worry about Django being "too heavy." It's decoupled enough that you can use the ORM if you want without having to import the rest. 

 That said, if I were already using CherryPy for the web layer and just needed an ORM, I'd probably opt for SQLAlchemy. 
 #1 Storm has arguably the simplest API: 

 class Foo:
  __storm_table__ 'foos'
  id = Int(primary=True)


 class Thing:
  __storm_table__ 'things'
  id = Int(primary=True)
  name = Unicode()
  description = Unicode()
  foo_id = Int()
  foo = Reference(foo_id, Foo.id)

 db = create_database('sqlite:')
 store = Store(db)

 foo = Foo()
 store.add(foo)
 thing = Thing()
 thing.foo = foo
 store.add(thing)
 store.commit()
 

 And it makes it painless to drop down into raw SQL when you need to: 

 store.execute('UPDATE bars SET bar_name=? WHERE bar_id like ?', []) 
store.commit()
 
 #2 I usually use SQLAlchemy . It's pretty powerful and is probably the most mature python ORM. 

 If you're planning on using CherryPy, you might also look into dejavu as it's by Robert Brewer (the guy that is the current CherryPy project leader). I personally haven't used it, but I do know some people that love it. 

 SQLObject is a little bit easier to use ORM than SQLAlchemy, but it's not quite as powerful. 

 Personally, I wouldn't use the Django ORM unless I was planning on writing the entire project in Django, but that's just me. 
 #3 If you're looking for lightweight and are already familiar with django-style declarative models, check out peewee:
 http://charlesleifer.com/docs/peewee/ 

 Example: 

 class Blog(Model):
 name = CharField()

class Entry(Model):
 blog = ForeignKeyField(Blog)
 title = CharField()
 body = TextField()
 pub_date = DateTimeField(default=datetime.datetime.now)

# query it like django
Entry.filter(blog__name='Some great blog')

# or programmatically for finer-grained control
Entry.select().join(Blog).where(name='Some awesome blog')

 #4 SQLAlchemy's declarative extension, which is becoming standard in 0.5, provides an all in one interface very much like that of Django or Storm. It also integrates seamlessly with classes/tables configured using the datamapper style: 

 Base = declarative_base()

class Foo(Base):
  __tablename__ 'foos'
  id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)

class Thing(Base):
 __tablename__ = 'things'

 id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
 name = Column(Unicode)
 description = Column(Unicode)
 foo_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('foos.id'))
 foo = relation(Foo)

engine = create_engine('sqlite://')

Base.metadata.create_all(engine) # issues DDL to create tables

session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)()

foo = Foo()
session.add(foo)
thing = Thing(name='thing1', description='some thing')
thing.foo = foo # also adds Thing to session
session.commit()
 
 #5 We use Elixir alongside SQLAlchemy and have liked it so far. Elixir puts a layer on top of SQLAlchemy that makes it look more like the "ActiveRecord pattern" counter parts. 
 #6 I think you might look at:

 Storm 
 #7 SQLAlchemy is very, very powerful. However it is not thread safe make sure you keep that in mind when working with cherrypy in thread-pool mode. 
 #8 This seems to be the canonical reference point for high-level database interaction in Python:
 http://wiki.python.org/moin/HigherLevelDatabaseProgramming 

 From there, it looks like Dejavu implements Martin Fowler's DataMapper pattern fairly abstractly in Python. 
 #9 There is no conceivable way that the unused features in Django will give a performance penalty. Might just come in handy if you ever decide to upscale the project. 
 #10 I used Storm + SQLite for a small project, and was pretty happy with it until I added multiprocessing. Trying to use the database from multiple processes resulted in a "Database is locked" exception. I switched to SQLAlchemy, and the same code worked with no problems. 
 #11 I'd like to introduce a new option: Quick ORM 
Its features: 

 
 quick: you could get and play with it in less than a minute. It couldn't be more straightforward. 
 easy: you don't have to write any SQL statement, including those "create table xxx ..." ones. 
 simple: the core code counts only 230 lines including comments and pydocs, bugs have nowhere to hide. 
 free: released under BSD license, you are free to use it and distribute it. 
 powerful: built upon SQLAlchemy and doesn't compromise its power. 
 flexible: you are free to write raw sql to improve performance. 
 support multiple databases: you can map your models to many databases without difficulty. 
 write less, do more: taking advantage of python metaclass reduces data modeling code dramatically. 
 long-term maintained: Continous efforts are taking to improve and maintain it. 
 

 Hello World Example: 

 from quick_orm.core import Database
from sqlalchemy import Column, String

class User(object):
 __metaclass__ = Database.DefaultMeta
 name = Column(String(30))

if __name__ == '__main__':
 database = Database('sqlite://')
 database.create_tables()

 user = User(name = 'Hello World')
 database.session.add_then_commit(user)

 user = database.session.query(User).get(1)
 print 'My name is', user.name
 

 A comprehensive example: 

 from quick_orm.core import Database
from sqlalchemy import Column, String, Text

class User(object):
 __metaclass__ = Database.DefaultMeta
 name = Column(String(70))

@Database.foreign_key(User)
class Post(object):
 __metaclass__ = Database.DefaultMeta
 content = Column(Text)

class Question(Post):
 title = Column(String(70))

@Database.foreign_key(Question)
class Answer(Post):
 pass

@Database.foreign_key(Post)
class Comment(Post):
 pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
 database = Database('sqlite://')
 database.create_tables()

 user1 = User(name = 'Tyler Long')
 user2 = User(name = 'Peter Lau')

 question = Question(user = user1, title = 'What is Quick ORM ?', content = 'What is Quick ORM ?')
 answer = Answer(user = user1, question = question,
  content = 'Quick ORM is a python ORM which enables you to get started in less than a minute!')
 comment1 = Comment(user = user2, content = 'good question', post = question)
 comment2 = Comment(user = user2, content = 'nice answer', post = answer)
 database.session.add_all_then_commit([question, answer, comment1, comment2])

 question = database.session.query(Question).get(1)
 print 'new comment on question:', question.comments.first().content
 print 'new comment on answer:', question.answers.first().comments.first().content

 # Could the last two lines work as you expected? Try it yourself!
 user = database.session.query(User).filter_by(name = 'Peter Lau').one()
 print 'Peter Lau has posted {0} comments'.format(user.comments.count())

 Disclaimer : I am the author of Quick ORM 
 #12 I'd check out SQLAlchemy 

 It's really easy to use and the models you wrok with aren't bad at all. 

 Django uses sqlalchemy for it's ORM but using it by itself lets you use it's full power 

 here's a small example on creating and selecting orm objects 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; ed_user = User('ed', 'Ed Jones', 'edspassword')
&gt;&gt;&gt; session.add(ed_user)
&gt;&gt;&gt; our_user = session.query(User).filter_by(name='ed').first() 
&gt;&gt;&gt; our_user
 &lt;User('ed','Ed Jones', 'edspassword')&gt;
