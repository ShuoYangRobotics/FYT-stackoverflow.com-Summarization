Question (ID-2070643): Subtracting two lists in Python In Python, How can one subtract two non-unique, unordered lists? Say we have a = [0,1,2,1,0] and b = [0, 1, 1] I'd like to do something like c = a - b and have c be [2, 0] or [0, 2] order doesn't matter to me. This should throw an exception if a does not contain all elements in b. 

 Note this is different from sets! I'm not interested in finding the difference of the sets of elements in a and b, I'm interested in the difference between the actual collections of elements in a and b. 

 I can probably work this out with a for loop, looking up the first element of b in a and then removing the element from b and from a, etc. But this doesn't appeal to me, I'd like to do this with list comprehension in a nice and easy way. Is this possible? 
 Answers (Total-9): #0 I know "for" is not what you want, but it's simple and clear, why bother? 

 for x in b:
 a.remove(x)
 
 #1 I'm not sure what the objection to a for loop is: there is no multiset in Python so you can't use a builtin container to help you out. 

 Seems to me anything on one line (if possible) will probably be helishly complex to understand. Go for readability and KISS. Python is not C :) 
 #2 Python 2.7 and 3.2 will add the collections.Counter class which is a dictionary that maps elements to the number of occurrences of the element. This can be used as a multiset. 

 According to the docs you should be able to do something like this (untested, since I do not have either version installed). 

 from collections import Counter
a = Counter(0,1,2,1)
b = Counter(0,1,1)

print a - b # ignores items in b missing in a

# check every element in a is in b
# a[key] returns 0 if key not in a, instead of raising an exception
assert all(a[key] &gt; b[key] for key in b)
 

 Edit : 

 Since you are stuck with 2.5 you could try importing it and define your own version if that fails. That way you will be sure to get the latest version if it is available, and fall back to a working version if not. You will also benefit from speed improvements if if gets converted to a C implementation in the future. 

 i.e. 

 try:
 from collections import Counter
except ImportError:
 class Counter(dict):
  ...
 

 You can find the current Python source here . 
 #3 Python 2.7+ and 3.0 have collections.Counter (a.k.a. multiset). The documentation links to Recipe 576611: Counter class for Python 2.5:

 Then you can write 

 a = Counter([0,1,2,1,0])
 b = Counter([0, 1, 1])
 c = a - b
 print list(c.elements()) # [0, 2]
 
 #4 I would do it in an easier way: 

 a_b = [e for e in a if not e in b ]
 

 

 ..as wich wrote, this is wrong - it works only if the items are unique in the lists. And if they are, it's better to use 

 a_b = list(set(a) - set(b))
 
 #5 You can try something like this: 

 class mylist(list):

 def __sub__(self, b):
  result = self[:]
  b = b[:]
  while b:
   try:
    result.remove(b.pop())
   except ValueError:
    raise Exception("Not all elements found during subtraction")
  return result


a = mylist([0, 1, 2, 1, 0] )
b = mylist([0, 1, 1])

&gt;&gt;&gt; a - b
[2, 0]
 

 You have to define what [1, 2, 3] - [5, 6] should output though, I guess you want [1, 2, 3] thats why I ignore the ValueError. 

 Edit:
Now I see you wanted an exception if a does not contain all elements, added it instead of passing the ValueError. 
 #6 to use list comprehension: 

 [i for i in a if not i in b or b.remove(i)]
 

 would do the trick. It would change b in the process though. But I agree with jkp and Dyno Fu that using a for loop would be better. 

 Perhaps someone can create a better example that uses list comprehension but still is KISS? 
 #7 To prove jkp's point that 'anything on one line will probably be helishly complex to understand', I created a one-liner. Please do not mod me down because I understand this is not a solution that you should actually use. It is just for demonstrational purposes. 

 The idea is to add the values in a one by one, as long as the total times you have added that value does is smaller than the total number of times this value is in a minus the number of times it is in b: 

 [ value for counter,value in enumerate(a) if a.count(value) &gt;= b.count(value) + a[counter:].count(value) ]
 

 The horror! But perhaps someone can improve on it? Is it even bug free? 

 Edit: Seeing Devin Jeanpierre comment about using a dictionary datastructure, I came up with this oneliner: 

 sum([ [value]*count for value,count in {value:a.count(value)-b.count(value) for value in set(a)}.items() ], [])
 

 Better, but still unreadable. 
 #8 I attempted to find a more elegant solution, but the best I could do was basically the same thing that Dyno Fu said: 

 from copy import copy

def subtract_lists(a, b):
 """
 &gt;&gt;&gt; a = [0, 1, 2, 1, 0]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; b = [0, 1, 1]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; subtract_lists(a, b)
 [2, 0]

 &gt;&gt;&gt; import random
 &gt;&gt;&gt; size = 10000
 &gt;&gt;&gt; a = [random.randrange(100) for _ in range(size)]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; b = [random.randrange(100) for _ in range(size)]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; c = subtract_lists(a, b)
 &gt;&gt;&gt; assert all((x in a) for x in c)
 """
 a = copy(a)
 for x in b:
  if x in a:
   a.remove(x)
 return a
