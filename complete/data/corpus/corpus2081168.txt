Question (ID-2081168): Python NameError list1 = [a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z]

for item in list1:
 print item
 

 Not sure why the above code is throwing this error: 

 NameError: "name 'a' is not defined"
 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 In addition to using quotes properly, don't retype the alphabet. 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; import string
&gt;&gt;&gt; string.ascii_lowercase
'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
&gt;&gt;&gt; L = list(string.ascii_lowercase)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print L
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', ...
&gt;&gt;&gt; help(string)
 
 #1 You have to put strings into (double) quotes 

 list1 = ["a","b","c",...] 
 

 should work 
 #2 String literal should be enclosed in quotes :) 

 list1 = ["a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j","k","l","m","n","o","p","q","r","s","t","u","v","w","x","y","z"]
 
 #3 Picking and choosing the best of the previous posts this is how I would do it since a string can be iterated. 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; import string
&gt;&gt;&gt; for letter in string.ascii_lowercase:
...  print(letter)
... 
 
 #4 python interprets the members in your list as variables,you shoud enclose them in 

 
 ' or 
 " 
 
 #5 Every language needs to differentiate between constants and names/variables. The most confusing is when you have to differentiate between string constants and identifiers/names/variables. 

 A shell (sh, bash, ksh, csh, cmd.com etc) tends to use constants; so you can just type a constant and you prefix a name/variable with a special character ($ for unix shells, % for cmd.com etc) when you want its value. 

 $ echo hello
hello
$ echo $PWD
/home/tzot
$ cd /tmp
$ cd $OLDPWD
 

 Most other generic programming languages tend to use variables much more than constants, so it's the other way around: you just type the name of a variable and you (typically) enclose string constants in quotes ('', "", [] etc): 

 # assumed: a_name= "the object it points to"

&gt;&gt;&gt; print ("a constant")
a constant
&gt;&gt;&gt; print (a_name)
the object it points to
 
 #6 When I need to make a list of characters, if they aren't already available in something defined in the std lib, and if I really need a list and not just a string, I use this form: 

 punc = list(r";:`~!@#$%^&amp;*()_-+=[]{}\|,./&lt;?&gt;")
vowels = list("aeiou") # or sometimes list("aeiouy")
 

 Much simpler than all those extra quotes and commas, and it's clear to the reader that I really meant I wanted a list, and not just a string.
