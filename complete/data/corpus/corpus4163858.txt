Question (ID-4163858): How to show my Facebook Wall on my website I am trying to show some of the recent posts on my wall on my website. when searched all over im getting the results for posting to the wall from the website. 

 I check facebook developer site, where i am not able to get clear idea. 

 Experts please help. 

 EDIT 1:
 LIKEBOX PLUGIN somewhat suits my basic needs. Any other better way? 
 Answers (Total-9): #0 Use the Facebook Graph API and have a look at the 'feed' connection on this page: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/user 
 #1 It looks that there is no official way with Facebook plugins. But you can try this jQuery plugin. I am just testing it and it looks ok for me.

 #2 i am going to use LIKEBOX plugin. it satisfies my requirement 
 #3 Take a look at http://developers.facebook.com/plugins 
 #4 I used PHP, curl, and the Graph API and the 'feed' connection. The 'feed' connection will give you a JSON stream that you can put into an array using json_decode(). Iterating over the resulting array returns the fact that it is an array of arrays, one called 'data' and one called 'paging'. The 'data' array contains all of the elements on your wall - according to facebook, the last 50 posts or the last 30 days of posts, whichever is greater. You will notice that there are several 'types', and you will need to use the switch statement below to do whatever you want with each posting type: link, status, photo or video. 
 #5 you can generate the feed rss with http://ahrengot.com/tutorials/facebook-rss-feed/ 

 this will give you the rss url then you can open it using in php EX 

 $rss = @file_get_contents($rssUrl); 

 $xml = @simplexml_load_string($rss); 

 and parse it.... 
 #6 I recommend anyone looking to display Facebook walls on any platform, (not just Wordpress or another open source CMS) to check http://www.neosmart.de/social-media/facebook-wall 

 Works like a charm

 #8 I would suggest going the free route. Try this tutorial http://demo.tutorialzine.com/2011/03/custom-facebook-wall-jquery-graph/
