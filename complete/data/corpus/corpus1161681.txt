Question (ID-1161681): Online Python interpreter for use *from* the iPhone? Is there an online Python interpreter or some such that would allow me to try out simple python code from my iPhone? 

 Something like try ruby! (in your browser) for Python, and works with the iPhone? 
 Answers (Total-8): #0 No. Python and all interpretation is strictly verboten on the iPhone. 

 That said, if you jailbreak your phone, you can install linux with python and go to town. 

 Edit: I didn't notice the word "online" before. Here's an online python interpreter:

 #1 CodePad allows you to run snippets of Python code (and many other languages!). 
 #2 If you jailbreak the phone and install cydia, cydia can install python, including a sample python app integrating the iphone objectivec api. 
 #3 The Sage notebook ( http://sagenb.org ) can be set to Python mode, and it allows you to run arbitrary Python code over the web. It has an evaluate button that I specifically added so I could use it from my iPhone/iPad. I'm currently working on more support (e.g., tab completion like with iPython for the iPhone). 
 #4 There is a CodeToGo IApp built upon IdeoneAPI 
 #5 Also worth noting that This javascript-free one works. 
 #6 Maybe try http://live.codenode.org , which I've seen been used with an IPhone. 
 #7 Try this http://try-python.mired.org/ .
