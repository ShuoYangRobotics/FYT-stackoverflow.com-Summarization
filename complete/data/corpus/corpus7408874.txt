Question (ID-7408874): python: easiest way to get a string of spaces of length N What's the easiest way to generate a string of spaces of length N in Python? 

 (besides something like this, which is multiline and presumably inefficient for large n: 

 def spaces(n):
 s = ''
 for i in range(n):
 s += ' '
 return s
 

 ) 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 try this, simple, only one line: 

  ' ' * n
 
 #1 It's as simple as: 

 s = ' ' * N
 
 #2 You could do it as a function: 

 def spaces(n):
 return ' ' * n
 

 Or just use the expression: 

 ' ' * n
 
 #3 Off the top of my head: 

 spaces = lambda x: ' ' * x
 
 #4 All these point mongers are no fun, and their simple answers stink. 

 The true answer is as follows: 

 def give_me_spaces(n):
 return (lambda : ''.join(' ' for _ in xrange(n)))()
 

 Also it's clearly superior because it uses functional programming. 
 #5 Had to dig through my python helper functions to find this, but here it is. It's served me well. 

 spaces = (lambda n: 
   (lambda z: z(lambda f: lambda m:'' if m &lt;= 0 else ' ' + f(m - 1))(n))
   (lambda f:(lambda x:f(lambda*a:x(x)(*a)))(lambda x:f(lambda*a:x(x)(*a)))))
