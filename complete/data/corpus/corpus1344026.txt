Question (ID-1344026): How to explicitly specify a path to Firefox for Selenium? I got Selenium IDE, followed this post , got to 

 python test_default_server.py
 

 and it complains Firefox is not in my path: 

 Please add the directory containing ''firefox.exe'' to your PATH environment
variable, or explicitly specify a path to Firefox 3 like this:
*firefox3c:\blah\firefox.exe
 

 I could change my PATH environment variable, but I'd rather pursue the local config option they are mentioning ("explicitly specify a path"). How do I do that? What does the "*firefox3c" refer to? 

 Selenium 1.0.1, Python 2.5, Windows XP. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 You have to use the following string when you instantiate selenium instead of just "*firefox": 

 "*firefox C:\\Program Files\\Mozilla Firefox\\firefox.exe"
 

 Notice: I'm not sure that path is correct, but it should be a similar one. 

 Update: Where do you instantiate your browser?
By the tags in the question I suppose you're a python guy: 

 def setUp(self):
 self.verificationErrors = []
 self.selenium = selenium("localhost", 4444, "*firefox C:\\Program Files\\Mozilla Firefox\\firefox.exe", "http://change-this-to-the-site-you-are-testing/")
 self.selenium.start()
 
 #1 If on C# editor, use the following string: 

 selenium = new DefaultSelenium("localhost", 4444, "*firefox C:\Program Files\firefox.exe", "http://www.google.com/"); 

 Note: use an extra back slash before Program Files and firefox.exe, since a single backslash becomes an unrecognised escape sequence. 
 #2 selenium("localhost", 4444, "*firefox C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe", "http://change-this-to-the-site-you-are-testing/")
worked in Java. 
 #3 The *firefox etc are the keys for which browser to use to run the tests. 

 There is a long list of them at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1317055/how-to-run-google-chrome-with-selenium-rc/1317131#1317131 - so you can target Firefox v2 ( firefox2), Firefox v3 ( firefox3), Google Chrome (*googlechrome) etc 
 #4 This helps very much. 
setUp("http://localhost:8080/BingDemo/BingDriver.html", "*firefox C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe");

 #5 This helps very much. setUp("http://localhost:8080/BingDemo/BingDriver.html", "*firefox C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe"); 

 However, replace all occurrences of \ with \ in *firefox C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe 

 Additionally, you could point your PATH to in environmental variables to mozilla.exe
