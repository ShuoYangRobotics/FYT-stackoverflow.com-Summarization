Question (ID-1277124): How do you install lxml on OS X Leopard without using MacPorts or Fink? I've tried this and run in to problems a bunch of times in the past. Does anyone have a recipe for installing lxml on OS X without MacPorts or Fink that definitely works? 

 Preferably with complete 1-2-3 steps for downloading and building each of the dependencies. 
 Answers (Total-11): #0 Thanks to @jessenoller on Twitter I have an answer that fits my needs - you can compile lxml with static dependencies, hence avoiding messing with the libxml2 that ships with OS X. Here's what worked for me: 

 cd /tmp
wget http://lxml.de/files/lxml-2.2.2.tgz
tar -xzvf lxml-2.2.2.tgz 
cd lxml-2.2.2
cd libs/
wget ftp://xmlsoft.org/libxml2/libxml2-2.7.3.tar.gz
wget ftp://xmlsoft.org/libxml2/libxslt-1.1.24.tar.gz
cd ..
python setup.py build --static-deps --libxml2-version=2.7.3 --libxslt-version=1.1.24 
sudo python setup.py install
 
 #1 This worked for me (10.6.8): 

 sudo env ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch x86_64" easy_install lxml
 
 #2 Easy_install can work using this: 

 STATIC_DEPS=true easy_install 'lxml>=2.2beta4' 

 you may then need to run, depending on permissions; 

 STATIC_DEPS=true sudo easy_install 'lxml>=2.2beta4'

 #3 This worked for me in the past install lxml on osx 
 #4 I've had excellent luck with Homebrew to install the libxml2 dependency: 

 brew install libxml2
 

 Homebrew doesn't seem to have libxslt available, but I've not yet had a need for XSLT. YMMV. 

 Once you have the dependency(s), then the usual methods work just fine: 

 pip install lxml
 

 or 

 easy_install lxml
 
 #5 Try installing Cython and installing from source, easy_install does fail. I haven't tried on my mac yet though. 

 Failing that the ports version isn't that ancient. You can see the dependencies, some of which had to be updated for my Linux build of lxml. 

 info py25-lxml
py25-lxml @2.1.5 (python, devel) 

 lxml is a Pythonic binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries. It is unique
in that it combines the speed and feature completeness of these libraries with
the simplicity of a native Python API, mostly compatible but superior to the
well-known ElementTree API.

 #6 This is quite up to date - march 2009: http://lsimons.wordpress.com/2008/08/31/how-to-install-lxml-python-module-on-mac-os-105-leopard/ 
 #7 lxml is included in the pypm repository: 

 $ pypm install lxml
 
 #8 I had this working fine with Snow Lepoard but after I upgraded to Lion I had to symlink gcc-4.2 to gcc. Running sudo env ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch x86_64" easy_install lxml was looking for gcc-4.2 instead of gcc. 
 #9 Have you tried with easy_install?

 I don't own a Mac so I can't test it, but easy_install is almost considered the standard way to install python modules, so if you don't know it you should have a look at it. 
 #10 I compile it in /usr/local without any issues whatsoever. 

 Install Python, libxml2, libxslt and then lxml. You might need setuptools installed too.
