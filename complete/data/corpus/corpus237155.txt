Question (ID-237155): Multiple mouse pointers? Is there a way to accept input from more than one mouse separately? I'm interested in making a multi-user application and I thought it would be great if I could have 2 or more users holding wireless mice each interacting with the app individually with a separate mouse arrow. 

 Is this something I should try to farm out to some other application/driver/os_magic? or is there a library I can use to accomplish this? Language isn't a HUGE deal, but C, C++, and Python are preferrable. 

 Thanks :) 

 edit: 

 Found this multi-pointer toolkit for linux (it's actually a multi-pointer x server):

 #1 Yes. I know of at least one program that does this, KidPad . I think it's written in Java and was developed by Juan Pablo Hourcade , now at the University of Iowa. You'd have to ask him how it was implemented. 
 #2 http://code.google.com/p/pymultimouse/ is a library using windows raw input, it worked in a test with 2 mice. 
 #3 You could use DirectInput with C/C++ (there's probably also bindings in other languages). You use IDirectInput8::EnumDevices() (using DX8; same function, different interface in other versions of DirectX) to get a list of all attached devices. Then, you create the devices and poll them IDirectInputDevice8::Poll() . This should almost definitely work with any number of mice, keyboards, and other input devices. MSDN has really good documentation on this. 
 #4 I have this vague feeling that BeOS used to let one pair a mouse and keyboard and have separate active windows and inputs. Wow... that was a long time ago. I thought that it would be very interesting for "paired" programming.
