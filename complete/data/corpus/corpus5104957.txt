 where is the file created? 
 

 In the application's current working directory. You can use os.getcwd to check it, and os.chdir to change it. 

 Opening file in the root directory probably fails due to lack of privileges. 
 #1 The file path "c:\Test\blah" will have a tab character for the `\T'. You need to use either: 

 "C:\\Test"
 

 or 

 r"C:\Test"
 
 #2 It will be created once you close the file (with or without writing). Use os.path.join() to create your path eg 

 filepath = os.path.join("c:\\","test.py")
 
 #3 The file is created wherever the root of the python interpreter was started. 

 Eg, you start python in /home/user/program , then the file "test.py" would be located at /home/user/program/test.py 
 #4 f = open("test.py", "a") Will be created in whatever directory the python file is run from. 

 I'm not sure about the other error...I don't work in windows. 
 #5 The besty practice is to use '/' and a so called 'raw string' to define file path in Python. 

 path = r"C:/Test.py"
 

 However, a normal program may not have the permission to write in the C: drive root directory. You may need to allow your program to do so, or choose something more reasonable since you probably not need to do so.
