Question (ID-4527338): how to install numpy and scipy on OS X? Hey guys I'm new to Mac so please bear with me. 

 I'm using snow leopard 10.6.4 at the moment. 

 I want to install numpy and scipy, so I downloaded the python2.6,numpy and scipy dmg files from their official site. However, I'm having problem import numpy: 

 Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/site-packages/numpy/core/multiarray.so: no matching architecture in universal wrapper
 

 Can anyone shed some light to this problem?> 
 Answers (Total-8): #0 Sounds as though you might be trying to use a 32-bit library from a 64-bit Python. Looks like there's an unofficial 64-bit Numpy available for Snow Leopard . 

 

 EDIT: The Python 2.6 .dmg available here is indeed 32-bit. (Specifically, it's a universal binary containing both i386 and ppc versions). The same is true of the regular numpy and scipy .dmg releases available here . (How do I know? See below!) So if you use those releases together you should be fine. 

 But you're not fine - so my guess is you're not using the version of Python from the 2.6 .dmg you downloaded. If you're running an executable python script, e.g.: 

 $ ./my-script.py
 

 then you could try specifying the Python you're using explicitly on the command line. Looks like the MacPython .dmg installs to /usr/local/bin/python, so try: 

 $ /usr/local/bin/python2.6 myscript.py
 

 Any joy? 

 

 How I determined the architecture the contents of those .dmg files are built for... 

 
 Mount the .dmg (i.e. double-click it to open a volume) 
 Use gunzip and pax to unpack the package contents to a local directory, e.g.: 

 $ mkdir tmp
$ cd tmp
$ gunzip -c /Volumes/Universal\ MacPython\ 2.6/MacPython.mpkg/Contents/Packages/PythonUnixTools-2.6.pkg/Contents/Archive.pax.gz | pax
 
 Use file to examine binary files in the package contents 

 $ file Versions/2.6/bin/python
Versions/2.6/bin/python: Mach-O universal binary with 2 architectures
Versions/2.6/bin/python (for architecture ppc): Mach-O executable ppc
Versions/2.6/bin/python (for architecture i386): Mach-O executable i386
 
 
 #1 The best way to manage packages on OS X is MacPorts . They have good Python, numpy, and scipy support. 
 #2 I had problems with numpy until I installed in a virtualenv, now I don't have any issues. I would definitely suggest trying that. 
 #3 for snow leopard 64 bit i used the following man

just execute and you are good to go.
Also look at the comments ( new AMD ...) 

 building numpy works all the time. but for scipy you need to provide the numpy config files.
install gfortran ..... 
 #4 Use the SciPy Superpack installer script by Chris Fonnesbeck. 
 #5 The best way to manage packages on OS X is Fink (not MacPorts :) ). They have good Python, NumPy, and SciPy support. 

 Why use a package manager? because you will not only get NumPy and SciPy, but also many other programs that you will inevitably need, all with a single point of entry (basically the install command of the manager). This is much more convenient than having to hunt for specific compiled versions of the programs that you want to install. 

 Why Fink? because Fink is reputedly more stable than MacPorts, and has many more packages. 
 #6 No need to use MacPorts or Fink. 

 Use the Python 2.6 installer and this Numpy installer . I think you need to have Numpy installed first, then install Scipy , and everything will work auto-magically. I remember that for a while, I needed to explicitly append the path to the site-packages directory at the top of my scripts for Python to know where to look. 
 #7 In case this is useful to someone, I also had problems installing numpy's binaries on OSX. The installer complained telling me that: 

 
 You cannot install numpy 1.5.1 on this volume. numpy requires System Python 2.6 to install. 
 

 Long story short: “System Python” means “python from python.org ” and “2.6” means really 2.6, not 2.5 and not 2.7. So, go and find the installer for the version of python that numpy wants and then all is great. 

 On my first attempt I understood numpy's error as telling me that I had an outdated python, so I got the latest version (2.7 at the time), but numpy kept complaining all the same. Only after a careful reading of the message I understood that it really wanted 2.6 and not any other version. I trashed the first installation (found in /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework ) and installed 2.6 after that. Finally numpy was happy to install and everything was fine.
