Question (ID-6618002): Python @property versus getters and setters Here is a pure Python-specific design question: 

 class MyClass(object):
 ...
 def get_my_attr(self):
  ...

 def set_my_attr(self, value):
  ...
 

 and 

 class MyClass(object):
 ...  
 @property
 def my_attr(self):
  ...

 @my_attr.setter
 def my_attr(self, value):
  ...
 

 One can encouter both approaches, but it looks like the getters/setters still prevail. 

 Python lets us to do it either way. If you would design a Python program, which approach would you use and why? 

 Thank you! 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 Prefer properties. It's what they're there for. 

 The reason is that all attributes are public in Python. Starting names with an underscore or two is just a warning that the given attribute is an implementation detail that may not stay the same in future versions of the code. It doesn't prevent you from actually getting or setting that attribute. Therefore, standard attribute access is the normal, Pythonic way of, well, accessing attributes. 

 The advantage of properties is that they are syntactically identical to attribute access, so you can change from one to another without any changes to client code. You could even have one version of a class that uses properties (say, for code-by-contract or debugging) and one that doesn't for production, without changing the code that uses it. At the same time, you don't have to write getters and setters for everything just in case you might need to better control access later. 
 #1 Using properties lets you begin with normal attribute accesses and then back them up with getters and setters afterwards as necessary . 
 #2 In Python you don't use getters or setters or properties just for the fun of it. You first just use attributes and then later, only if needed, eventually migrate to a property without having to change the code using your classes. 

 There is indeed a lot of code with extension .py that uses getters and setters and inheritance and pointless classes everywhere where e.g. a simple tuple would do, but it's code from people writing in C++ or Java using Python. 

 That's not Python code. 
 #3 Using properties is to me more intuitive and fits better into most code. 

 Comparing 

 o.x = 5
ox = o.x
 

 vs. 

 o.setX(5)
ox = o.getX()
 

 is to me quite obvious which is easier to read. Also properties allows for private variables much easier. 
 #4 The short answer is: properties wins hands down . Always. 

 The need for getters and setters can be sometimes there, but then I would "hide" them to the outside world. There are plenty of ways to do this in Python ( getattr , setattr , __getattribute__ , etc..., but a very concise and clean one is: 

 def set_email(self, value):
 if '@' not in value:
  raise Exception("This doesn't look like an email address.")
 self._email = value

def get_email(self):
 return self._email

email = property(get_email, set_email)
 

 Here's a brief article that introduce the topic of getters and setters in python. 
 #5 I feel like properties are about letting you get the overhead of writing getters and setters only when you actually need them. 

 Java Programming culture strongly advise to never give access to properties, and instead, go through getters and setters, and only those which are actually needed.
It's a bit verbose to always right these obvious piece of codes, and notice that 70% of the time they are never replaced by some non-trivial logic. 

 In python, people actually care for that kind of overhead, so that you can embrace the following practise 

 
 do not use getters and setters at first, when it is not need 
 use @property to implement those without changing the syntax of the rest of your code. 
 
 #6 I think both have their place. One issue with using @property is that it is hard to extend the behaviour of getters or setters in subclasses. 

 Or at least, I have not figured out how to do it :) The problem is that the actual getter/setter functions are hidden in the property. 

 You can actually get hold of the functions, e.g. with 

 class C(object):
 _p = 1
 @property
 def p(self):
  return self._p
 @p.setter
 def p(self, val):
  self._p = val
 

 you can access the getter and setter functions as C.p.fget and C.p.fset , but you can't use the normal method inheritance facilities to extend them.
