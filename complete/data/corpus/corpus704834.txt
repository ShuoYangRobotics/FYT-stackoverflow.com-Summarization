Question (ID-704834): Does anyone know about workflow frameworks/libraries in Python? I'm searching for a workflow library/framework for Python. I'm astonished that there I cannot find anything which is simple and not attached to Zope/Plone. 

 Does anyone know of an open-source, simple workflow library/framework. It's preferred to support Django, but not required. 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 Try GoFlow , a workflow engine for Django. 
 #1 Unfortunately it seems like most/all of the projects listed here are no longer active. Here's a new project which is currently ongoing: 

 http://packages.python.org/django-workflows/overview.html 
 #2 Another workflow project that I saw recently was repoze.workflow, which is a state-machine based workflow engine which was inspired by plone, but is a clean re-implementation. 

 http://svn.repoze.org/repoze.workflow/trunk/docs/index.rst 

 Not exactly sure how production ready it really is, but I do know some people that are using it. 
 #3 I used hurry.workflow: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hurry.workflow 
It has plenty of features but unfortunately has some zope dependecies so it may be not applicable for other frameworks. 
 #4 ntoll's workflow for django is alpha, but is actively developed 
 #5 I know there is an openerp, but it's not workflow..... 
 #6 Besides GoFlow (linked in Oli's answer) the only other Django workflow I know of is part of the Pinax project. 

 More generally for Python based workflows there is spiff workflow and Dave Kuhlman's Workflow and REST How-to that could probably be converted from Quixote to Django.
