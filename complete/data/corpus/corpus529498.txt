 Answers (Total-8): #0 It is Glade 3, a GUI Designer for GTK+ . It generates an XML file representing your GUI. You can load this GUI later using PyGTK . 

 Specifically, the screenshot is running a Mac OS X port of Glade 3 
 #1 That's glade, it actually produces XML, which can be used with the PyGTK library in python 
 #2 The GUI designer isn't "for" python, it's for gtk+ and the associated language bindings known as pygtk . 

 there are two gui editors available: 

 
 http://glade.gnome.org/ 
 http://www.mono-project.com/Stetic 
 
 #3 I use PyQt ( PyQt Homepage ); it is built on the QT Toolkit ( http://www.qtsoftware.com/ ). 

 If you are deploying to Windows, it works well with the py2exe module ( py2exe ). 

 It's fairly straightforward to use, especially if you already have experience with the QT libraries. 
 #4 Gazpacho is almost a clone of Glade, but written in pure PyGTK. We (the PIDA team) are currently refurbishing it. 
 #5 The one in the screenshot is Glade. 

 However, there are quite a few GUI-Builders for Python, as seen on http://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming 
 #6 A python GUI builder is boa-constructor , whcih uses the WxWidgets toolkit 
 #7 Tkinter is one of many GUI builders available for python. I prefer it.
