Question (ID-62064): The best Django webcasts/videos I'm currently learning Django though reading the Django Book , but I'm a huge fan of webcasts/screencasts/videos and haven't found any good ones so far. Are there any and which ones would you recommend? 
 Answers (Total-11): #0 Check the screencasts section at This Week In Django . 

 Update: The TWID site appears to be down, a condition which is likely permanent. The list of screencasts is still available at archive.org , but the bulk of the actual videos (Eric Florenzano's "Django from the Ground Up" series) were and are hosted at showmedo.com . 
 #1 ShowMeDo's Django section has a good collection. ShowMeDo's Python section has a large set of Python-related stuff that might give you extra background information. 

 If you comment in ShowMeDo and tell the authors what else you'd like to see, they're quite responsive and might make new tutorials based on your suggestions. 
 #2 I can recommend Eric Florenzano's "Django From the Ground
Up". It is a series of 13 videos showing the building of a
particular site from scratch, http://startthedark.com/ . 
(However the live site appears not to be functional, though. The confirmation E-mail for registration never arrives.) 

 The start URL is
 http://showmedo.com/videos/video?name=3360000&amp;fromSeriesID=336 

 The direct download URLs for the Flash videos are (approx. 25 MB each):

 #3 There's a list of Django screencasts on the Django Project web/wiki . 

 Once you have a handle on Django be sure to watch Eric Holscher's introduction of Django Command Extensions. He notes "it is one of my favorite third party apps, and it gets installed in every Django environment I work in." 

 And today the DjangoCon videos appeared on YouTube ... 
 #4 There are some good ones at ShowMeDo 
 #5 I found this series of screencasts to be pretty good at introducing it. 
 #6 The following is a great screencast that compares various web frameworks ( J2EE , Django , Zope and Ruby ): 

 Better Web App Development 
by Sean Kelly. 317 MB. 36 min 09 secs. 
 #7 Personally, I think this one is pretty good. 
 #8 First, don't read the Django book . It's very outdated. Instead, read the official Django docs . 

 Also, here's another link to the Django Con videos on YouTube (as listed by the guys at TWID). 
 #9 I've started from here . Pretty good. 
 #10 I would strongly suggest http://python.mirocommunity.org/ 
It's by far the best resource on the python &amp; django subjects. Please somebody show me better one :)
