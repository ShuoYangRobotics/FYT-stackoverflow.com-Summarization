Question (ID-7794009): What Is ** In Python? I read the following python code: 

 a=2**b
 

 I know several languages like c,c++,c#,java... i even googled ** operator without any results.  

 so what does 2**b means? 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 It is the exponentiation operator. In your example, a will have the result of 2 to the b th power. 

 Check out the last entry in the table in this section . 
 #1 it's simple ** means power, so 2**b means 2 to the power of b 
 #2 It's python's power operator . You can write this as a = pow(2, b) 
 #3 In that example ** does represent exponation. but **(and also * ) can be used as unpacking operators. for instance when using a list of variables of unknown length as args for a function. I'm new to programming and python so I have difficulty using this in an example. perhaps one of you more experienced users can demonstrate 
 #4 It means 2^b in other languages. Or math.pow(2, 4) if you were using the math module. 

 See operator documentation here: http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-long-complex 
 #5 This means to raise 2 to the power b. 

 See http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-long-complex 
 #6 ** can also be used as a function parameter to pass a variable number of keyword arguments to a function. Example: 

 def x(**kwargs):
 for key, value in kwargs.items():
  print "%s: %s" % (key, value)

x(y=2, z=3, a=1, b=2)
 

 Prints: 

 y: 2
z: 3
a: 1
b: 2
