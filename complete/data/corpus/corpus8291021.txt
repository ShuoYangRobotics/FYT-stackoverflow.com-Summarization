Question (ID-8291021): Regular expression tricks in python I have a lines in file as: 

 
keyword = NORTH FACE
keyword = GUESS
keyword = DRESSES
keyword = RALPH LAUREN
 

 My Code is: 

 keyword=re.findall(r'ke\w+ = \S+',s). 
 

 This prints only 

 
NORTH
GUESS
DRESSES
RALPH
 

 But I need regex to handle and print 

 
NORTH FACE
GUESS
DRESSES
RALPH LAUREN
 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Your regex is consuming non whitespace characters only ( \S ). That is why it stops matching when it encounters a space character. 

 Change that to .* . This will greedily match all characters except newlines ( \n ). 
 #1 Try this: 

 re.findall(r'ke\w+ = .+$', s)
 

 Or this, to capture only what's after the equals sign: 

 re.findall(r'ke\w+ = (.+)$', s)
 
 #2 You need to do keyword=re.findall(r'ke\w+ = \S.*',s) instead of keyword=re.findall(r'ke\w+ = \S+',s) . 

 Also, not sure if it serves what you want but following your example you could also do re.split as following: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; s = 'keyword = NORTH FACE'
&gt;&gt;&gt; re.split(' = ', s)
['keyword', 'NORTH FACE']
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
 
 #3 No need for regex. Try partition or split : 

 lines = '''\
keyword = NORTH FACE
keyword = GUESS
keyword = DRESSES
keyword = RALPH LAUREN
'''.splitlines()

for line in lines:
 line.partition(' = ')[2]
print
for line in lines:
 print line.split(' = ')[1]
 

 Output 

 NORTH FACE
GUESS
DRESSES
RALPH LAUREN

NORTH FACE
GUESS
DRESSES
RALPH LAUREN
 

 Update 

 Given the new information in the comment and making a guess as to the datafile format (Update the question with a REAL example!): 

 import re

data = '''\
keyword = NORTH FACE
score = 88466
normalizedKeyword = NORTH FACE

keyword = DRESSES
score = 79379
normalizedKeyword = DRESSES
'''

L = re.findall(r'keyword = (.*)\nscore = (.*)\n',data)
for i in L:
 print ','.join(i)
 

 Output 

 NORTH FACE,88466
DRESSES,79379
 
 #4 Try: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; s="""
... keyword = NORTH FACE
... keyword = GUESS
... keyword = DRESSES
... keyword = RALPH LAUREN
... """
&gt;&gt;&gt; re.findall(r'ke\w+ = .*',s)
['keyword = NORTH FACE', 'keyword = GUESS', 'keyword = DRESSES', 'keyword = RALPH LAUREN']
 
 #5 Not sure if this is what you seek ... 

 From one of your comments, if you have adjacent lines that you want the values to pair up, but may be surrounded by non-paired lines, you have to do a few things. 

 
 Read the entire file into a buffer. This is because the paired lines can be anywhere in the file. 
 Treat the string as a single line. 
 Globally capture the values. In the below example, capture buffer 1 will be the 'keyword' value, capture buffer 2 will be the 'score' value. The 'keyword' and 'score' are placeholders for the real constants you wish pairs of values to be found for. 
 

 Expanded regex: 
 (?:^|\n) [^\S\n]* 
 (?:keyword) [^\S\n]* = [^\S\n]* (\w(?:[^\S\n]*\w+)*) [^\S\n]* \n 
 \s* 
 (?:score) [^\S\n]* = [^\S\n]* (\w(?:[^\S\n]*\w+)*) [^\S\n]* 
 (?=\n|$)
