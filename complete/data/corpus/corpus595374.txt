Question (ID-595374): What's the Python function like sum() but for multiplication? Python's sum() function returns the sum of numbers in an iterable. 

 sum([3,4,5]) == 3 + 4 + 5 == 12
 

 I'm looking for the function that returns the product instead. 

 somelib.somefunc([3,4,5]) == 3 * 4 * 5 == 60
 

 I'm pretty sure such a function exists, but I can't find it. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Actually, Guido vetoed the idea: http://bugs.python.org/issue1093 

 But, as noted in that issue, you can make one pretty easily: 

 import operator
reduce(operator.mul, (3, 4, 5))
 
 #1 There isn't one built in, but it's simple to roll your own, as demonstrated here : 

 import operator
def prod(lst):
 return reduce(operator.mul, lst)
 

 See answers to this question:

 #2 Numeric.product
 

 ( or 

 reduce(lambda x,y:x*y,[3,4,5])
 

 ) 
 #3 Use this 

 def prod( iterable ):
 p= 1
 for n in iterable:
  p *= n
 return p
 

 Since there's no built-in prod function. 
 #4 There's a "prod()" in numpy that does what you're asking for. 
 #5 If Python had one it would be called product(), unfortunately it doesn't. You can do something like Steve B. mentioned.
