Question (ID-5871041): Python list and type error I've code this code in Python: 

 if type(data).__name__=='list':
    print type(data).__name__
    print ",".join(data)
 

 And it give me this error: 

  print ",".join(data)
exceptions.TypeError: sequence item 0: expected string, list found
 

 How's that possible?!? 

 Thanks in advance for anyhelp. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 str.join() can only join a sequence of strings. Obviously your list contains an item that itself is a list again. 

 Furthermore, if you really need to check for the type of an object, a better way to do it is 

 if isinstance(data, list):
 ...
 
 #1 The first element of data is a list . It must be a string in order for str.join() to work as shown. In fact, all elements must. 
 #2 Don't explicitly check for types. If you do need to, use isinstance . 

 The error is appearing because of the contents of data rather than its type. It needs to be a list of strings for the str.join method to work on it. 
 #3 The first element of your list is also a list, not a string. 

 Also you don't have to do type(data).__name__=='list' - just type(data) is list 

 Even better - just check with isinstance since you don't really care about a specific type in most cases. 
 #4 join expects an iterable of strings . What seems to happen in your case is that the first element of your list is another list. This is what's causing the error. 

 As an aside, the if type(data).__name__=='list': ... is as un-Pythonic as code gets. 
 #5 You appear to have a list of lists. Try: 

 ",".join(str(x) for x in data)
