Question (ID-1401941): Script to connect to a web page Looking for a python script that would simply connect to a web page (maybe some querystring parameters). 

 I am going to run this script as a batch job in unix. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 urllib2 will do what you want and it's pretty simple to use. 

 import urllib
import urllib2

params = {'param1': 'value1'}

req = urllib2.Request("http://someurl", urllib.urlencode(params))
res = urllib2.urlopen(req)

data = res.read()
 

 It's also nice because it's easy to modify the above code to do all sorts of other things like POST requests, Basic Authentication, etc. 
 #1 A simple wget called from a shell script might suffice. 
 #2 Try this: 

 aResp = urllib2.urlopen("http://google.com/");
print aResp.read();
 
 #3 If you need your script to actually function as a user of the site (clicking links, etc.) then you're probably looking for the python mechanize library.

 #4 What are you trying to do? If you're just trying to fetch a web page, cURL is a pre-existing (and very common) tool that does exactly that. 

 Basic usage is very simple: 

 curl www.example.com
 
 #5 You might want to simply use httplib from the standard library. 

 myConnection = httplib.HTTPConnection('http://www.example.com')
 

 you can find the official reference here: http://docs.python.org/library/httplib.html
