Question (ID-1590689): What is the best advanced Python book? Can someone suggest an advanced Python book? I want a book that covers topics such as threading, networking, memory management and so on. 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 I find "Python Essential Reference" useful. It is a great reference and general language book.

 #1 For the topics you described, you need to understand operating systems more than python. Once the OS level becomes clear, the Python code is quite obvious. 

 This is one of the best books ever written: 

 Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment, Second Edition (Addison-Wesley Professional Computing Series) (Paperback) 

 ISBN-10: 0321525949 
ISBN-13: 978-0321525949 

 5 star amazon reviews (I'd give it 6). 

 Once I realized that networking, file I/O, shared memory, IPC, sockets, signals, etc... are all provided by the OS layer, then this became the answer to a lot of questions. 

 Then going back to python, you understand what all the stuff in the os module means, and can write really advanced programs with ease. 
 #2 The python cookbook is a good repository of examples, though some of them are getting a bit long in the tooth these days. The second edition is newer (2005), though it is targeted to 2.4.
