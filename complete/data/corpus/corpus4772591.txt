Question (ID-4772591): Python or Ruby Interpreter on iOS I found this application on the app store: iLuaBox 
and I wondered if there was anything else like this for the iPhone without jailbreaking but instead for Python or Ruby? 

 Lua is probably similar for me to play around with the basic programming I do anyway but I thought I would just ask)

I guess we will have to wait a little to see complex language like Python and Ruby interpreter.
Since LUA is a scripting language, it is easier to port it. 
 #1 What is your goal? If it is to write in a dynamic language instead of objective-C then you may want to investigate the Rhodes framework . It allows you to use Ruby in a Rails-like MVC framework and will create native iPhone and Android apps. 
 #2 If you just want to be able to run ruby and python scripts, codetogo lets you do that.

 It gets around it by sending your code to a server, running it and then sending back the result. 
 #3 There is a simple native Python interpreter for IOS available now. No jailbreak needed:

 #4 there is also python math which is free but it has its modules restricted to the math stuff but it allows you to sync .py scripts from itunes so you could import any modules that you need 
 #5 A Python module that allows running Lua code from Python in a sandbox. Intended to execute arbitrary, possibly unsafe code submitted by users.

 #6 A new python interpreter for the iOS is up on the App store:
