Question (ID-49146): How can I make an EXE file from a Python program? I've used several modules to make EXEs for Python, but I'm not sure if I'm doing it right. 

 How should I go about this, and why? Please base your answers on personal experience, and provide references where necessary. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 py2exe is probably what you want, but it only works on Windows. PyInstaller works on Windows and Linux. Py2app works on the Mac. 
 #1 I found this presentation to be very helpfull. 

 How I Distribute Python applications on Windows - py2exe &amp; InnoSetup 

 From the site: 

 
 There are many deployment options for
 Python code. I'll share what has
 worked well for me on Windows,
 packaging command line tools and
 services using py2exe and InnoSetup.
 I'll demonstrate a simple build script
 which creates windows binaries and an
 InnoSetup installer in one step. In
 addition, I'll go over common errors
 which come up when using py2exe and
 hints on troubleshooting them. This is
 a short talk, so there will be a
 follow-up Open Space session to share
 experience and help each other solve
 distribution problems. 
 
 #2 Not on the freehackers list is gui2exe which can be used to build standalone Windows executables, Linux applications and Mac OS application bundles and plugins starting from Python scripts.
