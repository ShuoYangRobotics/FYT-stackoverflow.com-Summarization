Question (ID-1693939): Need a GUI Builder for Tkinter / Python I need a GUI Builder for Tkinter... was using something a couple of years ago, but I can't find it anymore (I remember something related to Komodo IDE, but perhaps I'm wrong). 
Please don't give me links to non-functional, old or dead projects, because I found lots of them and none worked; I need something functional. Also, I don't want builders for pygtk/pyqt/other toolkits. 

 Thanks! 
 Answers (Total-8): #0 Have a look at Rapyd-Tk . It might be the thing you're looking for (and it's free). 
 #1 Visual Tkinter
Free Python IDE

 #2 A google search yielded this: 

 
 But when you are just starting out it might be nice to use a graphical
 designer. I don't know of any that are permanently free, but here's
 an idea. ActiveState's Komodo Pro editor does include a Tkinter
 designer, and you can try the product free for 30 days. That might be
 long enough to get you past the steep part of the learning curve. And
 you might find that Komodo is a good enough editor to be worth the $$.
 I sure enjoy using it myself.

 #3 I have coded some Tkinter in the past and it is VERY straightforward.
This is where I learned to code it:

 It is the best intro to Tkinter that I have seen 
 #4 Not really a GUi builder - but it let's you define Tkinter GUI's in JSON files: https://github.com/tmetsch/pytkgen 
 #5 
 I remember something related to Komodo IDE 
 

 The Komodo 3 GUI builder was open sourced, but has seen very few updates since 2006: http://spectcl.sourceforge.net/ 
 #6 There is also PAGE (Python Automatic GUI Generator), which is a visual GUI builder for Python/Tkinter. 
 #7 GUI Builder is a next-generation SpecTcl alternative (as they say).
