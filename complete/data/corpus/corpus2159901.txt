Question (ID-2159901): wxPython autocomplete What editors or IDEs offer decent autocompletion for wxPython on Windows or Linux? Are there any? I tried several and support is either non-existant or limited.

 #1 Wingide can do it 
 #2 I use Eclipse/PyDev for wxPython development. I've been very satisfied with Eclipse for Python development productivity. It does have support for autocompletion for wxPython. 
 #3 Eclipse+PyDev with the install directory for wxPython added to the PythonPath has fully functioning autocomplete.
 Pydev 
 #4 try use brain to autocomplete... :) 

 just joking. when I coding in in PyQt4, I open qt-assistant and search the manual,
and wrap myclass like : MyButton = QPusuButton 

 I think it is impossible to use autocomplete in python,
because only in runtime the computer know what happens. 
 #5 Whatever the default windows IDE for Python is can autocomplete, with code not from the standard library.
