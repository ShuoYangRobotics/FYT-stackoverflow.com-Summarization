Question (ID-5595276): PyDev Eclipse Python interpreters Error: stdlib not found I have been trying to use Eclipse 3.6 as a Python editor. 
I install the latest version of PyDev, and then try to set the Interpreter - Python field of the preferences, on my mac. 

 My python version is 2.6 and the path is "/usr/bin/python". When I enter this, and I select the items to add to the system PYTHONPATH I get the following error message below. 

 So I can't tell eclipse the interpreter path! 
Any help would be great! 
(I tried reinstalling PyDev already, no luck) 

 Thanks! 

 "Error: Python stdlib not found 

 It seems that the Python /Lib folder (which contains the standard library) was not found /selected during the instal process. 

 This folder (which contains files such as threading.py and traceback.py) is required for PyDev to function properly (and it must contain the actual source files, not only .pyc files)

 Following Praveen's answer, My python library is in /library/python/2.6/site-packages. When I enter /usr/bin/python into the interpreter field, eclipse asks me which paths I would like to add to my System PYTHONPATH. One of the checkbox items is exactly that path. So I check it, along with the other boxes. Click ok, and I get the same error. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Had the same problem. Eclipse wouldn't find all the required path using the default installed python (2.6). I downloaded python 2.7, went through the install. My new "which python" path became: 

 /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python. 

 When I tried to set up the interpreter this time, specified this path and it went right through. 

 Note: 

 
 Browse to /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin directory 
 Select the python interpreter that's installed. Sometimes the 'python' link doesn't exist to the current interpreter (say, python3) 
 
 #1 just found an answer to my own question, thought it might enlighten other users with similar problems. I will try it out later to see if it works.

 "I downloaded the Python source release and simply dropped the /Lib folder into the /System/..../Frameworks/.../lib/python2.6/ and it works."

 "That's a solution (although usually what I do on Mac OS is getting a python install from python.org instead of using the default one -- not sure what you may break in Mac OS if something bad happens there while developing)." 
 #2 PyDev needs the location of the python lib folder to get this directory location on your computer try running this command in the terminal. 

 python -c "from distutils.sysconfig import get_python_lib; print get_python_lib()"
 

 And add that directory to your PYTHONPATH location in PyDev in Eclipse. 
 #3 I too had the error: stdlib sources not found. 

 My fix was to install XCode 4.2 and then retry Eclipse's PyDev "Auto Config" method. 

 No error. PyDev running OK! 
 #4 I found the solution of not touching macs deliverd python version, but downloading ad installing a new one (currently 3.something) 

 when setting up the interpreter, point to /usr/local/bin/pyhton3 

 (to find out the exact path open terminal and type: sudo -s !hittenter> your password !hittenter> cd /usr/local/bin !hittenter> ls !hittenter>)
-> what this does is, showing you the content of the folder you went to. you should find the python interpreter in there. 

 WARNING!!!!
Do not touch or change any other python files/folders delivered with your mac. 
 #5 After installing Apple's OSX Developer tools from http://developer.apple.com/xcode/ , the necessary .py files will be installed in /library/python/2.6/site-packages. No need to fuss with installing python yourself of using versions of Python not blessed by Apple.
