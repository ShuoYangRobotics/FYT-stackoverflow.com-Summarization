Question (ID-766335): Python speed testing - Time Difference - milliseconds What is the proper way to compare 2 times in Python in order to speed test a section of code? I tried reading the API docs. I'm not sure I understand the timedelta thing. 

 So far I have this code: 

 from datetime import datetime

tstart = datetime.now()
print t1

# code to speed test

tend = datetime.now()
print t2
# what am I missing?
# I'd like to print the time diff here
 
 Answers (Total-9): #0 datetime.timedelta is just the difference between two datetimes ... so it's like a period of time, in days / seconds / microseconds 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; a = datetime.datetime.now()
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = datetime.datetime.now()
&gt;&gt;&gt; c = b - a

&gt;&gt;&gt; c
datetime.timedelta(0, 4, 316543)
&gt;&gt;&gt; c.days
0
&gt;&gt;&gt; c.seconds
4
&gt;&gt;&gt; c.microseconds
316543
 

 You can do all sorts of maths with datetime.timedelta, eg: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; c / 10
datetime.timedelta(0, 0, 431654)
 

 It might be more useful to look at CPU time instead of wallclock time though ... that's operating system dependant though ... under Unix-like systems, check out the 'time' command. 
 #1 You might want to use the timeit module instead. 
 #2 You could also use: 

 import time

start = time.clock()
do_something()
end = time.clock()
print "%.2gs" % (end-start)
 

 Or you could use the python profilers . 
 #3 time.time() / datetime is good for quick use, but is not always 100% precise. For that reason, I like to use one of the std lib profilers (especially hotshot) to find out what's what. 
 #4 You may want to look into the profile modules. You'll get a better read out of where your slowdowns are, and much of your work will be full-on automated. 
 #5 You could simply print the difference: 

 print tend - tstart
 
 #6 I am not a Python programmer, but I do know how to use Google and here's what I found: you use the "-" operator. To complete your code: 

 from datetime import datetime

tstart = datetime.now()

# code to speed test

tend = datetime.now()
print tend - tstart
 

 Additionally, it looks like you can use the strftime() function to format the timespan calculation in order to render the time however makes you happy. 
 #7 The following code should display the time detla... 

 from datetime import datetime

tstart = datetime.now()

# code to speed test

tend = datetime.now()
print tend - tstart
