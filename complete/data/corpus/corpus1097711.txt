Question (ID-1097711): How to get repository for core-plot I am not able to get the repository for core-plot. What I am doing is that I am typing this in the terminal: 

 hg clone https://core-plot.googlecode.com/hg/ core-plot
 

 and this is what I get: 

 
Traceback (most recent call last):

File "/usr/local/bin/hg", line 25, in 
mercurial.util.set_binary(fp)

 raise ValueError, 'unknown locale: %s' % localename

ValueError: unknown locale: UTF-8
 

 I can't seem to get it to install. Please give me guidance on how to install the repository. 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 Have you installed Mercurial on your computer? If not, you can download an installer here: http://mercurial.berkwood.com/ 
 #1 It looks like you're having a problem with your locale. Are you using Leopard? If so, check your Terminal preferences. In the Terminal prefs, open up the Settings pane, and click the Advanced tab. The "Character Encoding" menu should be set to "Unicode (UTF-8)". Also make sure that "Set LANG variable on startup" is checked. 

 You can check your locale setting by opening up the Terminal and typing echo $LANG . Mine returns en_US.UTF-8 (US English, UTF-8). Not sure what your preferred language is, but it should be &lt;langcode&gt;.UTF-8 -- make sure it ends with UTF-8 . 
 #2 See following question here, 

 http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1694539/how-to-create-line-chart-in-iphone-application/1717734#1717734 

 I have added my answer there for the same one. 
 #3 The repository works perfectly fine: 

 â†ª hg clone https://core-plot.googlecode.com/hg/ core-plot
requesting all changes
adding changesets
adding manifests
adding file changes
added 406 changesets with 3444 changes to 1861 files
updating working directory
1018 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved
 

 So I suspect your problem is that hg isn't in your path, or you've not installed Mercurial. You should grab a copy of the installer , or install via your package management system (MacPorts, Apt, YUM etc.) 
 #4 It looks to me like you have a broken Python installation. However, since you're trying to get Mercurial working, please contact the Mercurial team through the correct channels. Use the 

 
 Mercurial mailinglist or the 
 Mercurial bug tracker . 
 

 Doing so means that many more people see your problem and hopefully there will be someone who is using Mac who can help you (I'm using Debian and don't know what Apple has done to your Python installation...). 
 #5 LANG can be overridden by HGENCODING. If "echo $HGENCODING" produces "UTF-8" that's your culprit. Unset it or set it to en_US.UTF-8 (or whatever language you prefer, but it should end in .UTF-8). You could also try setting HGENCODING or LANG to "C" if you have no need for non-ascii characters, or just as a test. 
 #6 I am creating local copy of core plot repository using following command but it gives error, 

 hg clone https://core-plot.googlecode.com/hg/ core-plot 

 abort: error: Connection refused 

 Please suggest me solution.
