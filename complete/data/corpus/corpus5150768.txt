Question (ID-5150768): Printing alternate lines using python I have a text file like 

 
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
 

 ... and so on. 

 How do I write a program to print the first 2 lines then skip 3 then print 2 lines (that's the pattern.) 

 I'm a complete noob. 
Any help will be appreciated. 

 thanks. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Based on line enumeration and assuming a 5-item cycle (display first two items, skip next three items): 

 for i, line in enumerate(file('myfile.txt')):

 if i % 5 in (0, 1):
  print line
 
 #1 I don't know if there's a pattern for this, really. You could just file.readlines() the entire thing and use array slicing. If you're concerned about memory consumption, iterate over the file handle using itertools.compress() on a pattern generated by itertools.cycle() . Or, you know, just write a loop or list comprehension. 
 #2 The best that I can come up with is to use the modulo operator. Something like this: 

 f = open('filename.txt', 'r')
for index, line in enumerate(f.readlines()):
 if index%5 &lt;= 1:
  print(line)
 

 This should produce the pattern you are looking for. 
 #3 Since others beat me to the answer here's the one line version: 

 print list(line for lineNum, line in enumerate(open("test.txt", "r")) if lineNum % 5 in (0, 1))
 

 :-) 
 #4 with open(filename) as f:
 print ''.join( f.readline() for i in xrange(7) if i in (0,1,5,6))
 

 or 

 with open(filename) as f:
 print ''.join( f.readline() for i in '1100011' if i=='1')
 

 or 

 with open(filename) as f:
 print ''.join( i*f.readline() for i in (1,1,0,0,0,1,1))
 
 #5 Building on @pynator's answer, and using the itertools module ,
here is the same solution as a ifilter - imap combination. 

 z is an iterable, like file("myfile.txt") .
 imap is used to pick the original data item from an enumerated pair. 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; from itertools import ifilter, imap
&gt;&gt;&gt; result = imap(lambda x: x[1], ifilter(lambda x: x[0]%5 in (0,1), enumerate(z)))
&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in result: print i

line 1
line 2
line 6
line 7
line 11
line 12
line 16
line 17
