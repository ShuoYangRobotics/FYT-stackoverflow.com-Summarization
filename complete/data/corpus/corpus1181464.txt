 Answers (Total-6): #0 Tested on WinXP, Python 2.6 after installing pywin32 (pywin32-214.win32-py2.6.exe in my case): 

 import win32api, win32con
def click(x,y):
 win32api.SetCursorPos((x,y))
 win32api.mouse_event(win32con.MOUSEEVENTF_LEFTDOWN,x,y,0,0)
 win32api.mouse_event(win32con.MOUSEEVENTF_LEFTUP,x,y,0,0)
click(10,10)
 
 #1 You can use win32api or ctypes to call win32 api call, to control mouse or any gui. 

 A fun sample here to control mouse ;) using win32api 

 import win32api
import time
import math

for i in range(500):
 x = 500+math.sin(math.pi*i/100)*500
 y = 500+math.cos(i)*100
 win32api.SetCursorPos((x,y))
 time.sleep(.01)
 

 a click using ctypes 

 import ctypes

# see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms646260(VS.85).aspx for details
ctypes.windll.user32.SetCursorPos(100, 20)
ctypes.windll.user32.mouse_event(2, 0, 0, 0,0) # left down
ctypes.windll.user32.mouse_event(4, 0, 0, 0,0) # left up
 
 #2 Dont know python but perhaps a google would help 

 "Python controlling mouse movement" revealed this

 from Xlib import X, display
d = display.Display()
s = d.screen()
root = s.root
root.warp_pointer(300,300)
d.sync()
 
 #3 Check out the cross platform PyMouse: https://github.com/pepijndevos/PyMouse/ 
 #4 You'll really need to specify which GUI toolkit you're using in order to get a detailed answer. The specific answer depends on operating system, widget toolkit, and to some extent, which implementation of python you're using. In short, this is an unanswerable question. 
 #5 This has nothing to do with Python directly. You have to access the toolkits provided by the system. Have a look at the Windows API .
