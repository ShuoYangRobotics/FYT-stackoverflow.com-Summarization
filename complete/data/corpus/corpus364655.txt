Question (ID-364655): How do I use my standard python path when running python scripts from xcode macros I'm trying to run Python scripts using Xcode's User Scripts menu. 

 The issue I'm having is that my usual os.sys.path (taken from ~/.profile) does not seem to be imported when running scripts from XCode the way it is when running them at the Terminal (or with IPython). All I get is the default path, which means I can't do things like 

 #!/usr/bin/python
import myScript

myScript.foo()
 

 Where myScript is a module in a folder I've added to my path. 

 I can append a specific path to os.sys.path manually easily enough, but I have to do it in every single script for every single path I want to use modules from 

 Is there a way to set this up so it uses the same path I use everywhere else? 

 EDIT: After looking into things a bit more, it seems like scripts executed from Xcode use a completely different PATH than normal. The path I get by running a script in Xcode is: 

 PATH=/Developer/usr/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
 

 and I'm sure my regular path doesn't have /Developer/usr/bin in it. Does anybody have any idea where this path is coming from? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 On the mac, environment variables in your .profile aren't visible to applications outside of the terminal. 

 If you want an environment variable (like PATH, PYTHONPATH, etc) to be available to xcode apps, you should add it to a new plist file that you create at ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist. 

 See the EnvironmentVars doc on the apple developer website for more details. 
 #1 A quick but hackish way is to have a wrapper script for python. 

 cat &gt; $HOME/bin/mypython &lt;&lt; EOF
#!/usr/bin/python
import os
os.path = ['/list/of/paths/you/want']
EOF
 

 and then start all your XCode scripts with 

 #!/Users/you/bin/mypython
 
 #2 Just add the paths to sys,path. 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; import sys
&gt;&gt;&gt; sys.path
['', ... lots of stuff deleted....]
&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in sys.path:
...  print i

 #3 I tend to use pth files. From the docs. 

 
 The most convenient way is to add a
 path configuration file to a directory
 that’s already on Python’s path,
 usually to the .../site-packages/
 directory. Path configuration files
 have an extension of .pth, and each
 line must contain a single path that
 will be appended to sys.path. (Because
 the new paths are appended to
 sys.path, modules in the added
 directories will not override standard
 modules. This means you can’t use this
 mechanism for installing fixed
 versions of standard modules.) 
 

 So the simplest thing to do is to do the following: 

 echo "/some/path/I/want/to/add" &gt; /Library/Python/2.5/site-packages/custom.pth

 #4 Forgive me if my answer seems ignorant, I'm not totally familiar with Mac and I also may have misunderstood your question. 

 On Windows and Linux, when I want to refer to a script I've written, I set the PYTHONPATH environment variable. It is what os.sys.path gets its values from, if I remember correctly. 

 Let's say myScript.py is in /Somewhere. Set PYTHONPATH to: 

 PYTHONPATH = /Somewhere
 

 Now you should be able to "import myScript". 

 If you start doing sub-folders as python packages, look into usage of init .py files in each folder. 

 If you plan on re-using this and other scripts all the time, you should leave PYTHONPATH set as an environment variable. 
 #5 Not sure if Xcode counts as launching the script through Finder or not, but if it does, apparently Finder doesn't read .profile or .cshrc files when it starts for a user the way Terminal does. If your question is unanswered still, check out Apple's knowledge base: QA1067 and set up your environment using the plist.
