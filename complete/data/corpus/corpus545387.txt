Question (ID-545387): Linux: compute a single hash for a given folder & contents? Surely there must be a way to do this easily! 

 I've tried the linux command-line apps sha1sum &amp; md5sum but they seem only to be able to compute hashes of individual files and output a list of hash values, one for each file. 

 I need to generate a single hash for the entire contents of a folder (not just the filenames). 

 I'd like to do something like 

 sha1sum /folder/of/stuff &gt; singlehashvalue
 

 Edit: to clarify, my files are at multiple levels in a directory tree, they're not all sitting in the same root folder. 
 Answers (Total-8): #0 One possible way would be: 
sha1sum /path/to/folder/* | sha1sum
 

 If there is a whole directory tree, you're probably better off using find and xargs. One possible command would be 
find /path/to/folder -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sha1sum | sha1sum
 

 Edit : Good point, it's probably a good thing to sort the list of files, so: 
find path/to/folder -type f -print0 | sort -z | xargs -0 sha1sum | sha1sum

 Commit the directory to git, use the commit hash. See metastore for a way to also control permissions. 
 Use a file system intrusion detection tool like aide . 
 hash a tar ball of the directory: 

 tar cvf - /path/to/folder | sha1sum 
 Code something yourself, like vatine's oneliner : 

 find /path/to/folder -type f -print0 | sort -z | xargs -0 sha1sum | sha1sum 
 
 #2 If you just want to hash the contents of the files, ignoring the filenames then you can use 

 cat $FILES | md5sum
 

 Make sure you have the files in the same order when computing the hash: 

 cat $(echo $FILES | sort) | md5sum
 

 But you can't have directories in your list of files. 
 #3 What's wrong with a tar -c /path/to/folder | sha1sum ? 
 #4 Try to make it in two steps: 

 
 create a file with hashes for all files in a folder 
 hash this file 
 

 Like so: 

 # for FILE in `find /folder/of/stuff -type f | sort`; do sha1sum $FILE &gt;&gt; hashes; done
# sha1sum hashes
 

 Or do it all at once: 

 # cat `find /folder/of/stuff -type f | sort` | sha1sum
 
 #5 You could sha1sum to generate the list of hash values and then sha1sum that list again, it depends on what exactly it is you want to accomplish. 
 #6 I would pipe the results for individual files through sort (to prevent a mere reordering of files to change the hash) into md5sum or sha1sum , whichever you choose. 
 #7 There is a python script for that:

 If you change the names of a file without changing their alphabetical order, the hash script will not detect it. But, if you change the order of the files or the contents of any file, running the script will give you a different hash than before.
