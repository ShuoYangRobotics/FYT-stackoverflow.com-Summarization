Question (ID-953561): Check unread count of Gmail messages with Python How can I check the number of unread Gmail message in my inbox with a short Python script? Bonus points for retrieving the password from a file. 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 I advise you to use Gmail atom feed 

 It is as simple as this: 

 import urllib

url = 'https://mail.google.com/mail/feed/atom/'
opener = urllib.FancyURLopener()
f = opener.open(url)
feed = f.read()
 

 You can then use the feed parse function in this nice article: Check Gmail the pythonic way 
 #1 Well, I'm going to go ahead and spell out an imaplib solution as Cletus suggested. I don't see why people feel the need to use gmail.py or Atom for this. This kind of thing is what IMAP was designed for. Gmail.py is particularly egregious as it actually parses Gmail's HTML. That may be necessary for some things, but not to get a message count! 

 import imaplib, re
conn = imaplib.IMAP4_SSL("imap.gmail.com", 993)
conn.login(username, password)
unreadCount = re.search("UNSEEN (\d+)", conn.status("INBOX", "(UNSEEN)")[1][0]).group(1)
 

 Pre-compiling the regex may improve performance slightly. 
 #2 import imaplib
obj = imaplib.IMAP4_SSL('imap.gmail.com','993')
obj.login('username','password')
obj.select()
obj.search(None,'UnSeen')
 
 #3 Well it isn't a code snippet but I imagine using imaplib and the Gmail IMAP instructions get you most of the way there. 
 #4 Use Gmail.py 

 file = open("filename","r")
usr = file.readline()
pwd = file.readline()
gmail = GmailClient()
gmail.login(usr, pwd)
unreadMail = gmail.get_inbox_conversations(is_unread=True)
print unreadMail
 

 Gets login information from a text file assuming the login name and password are on separate lines. 
 #5 Once you are logged in (do this manually or with gmail.py) you should use the feed. 

 It is located here:
 http://mail.google.com/mail/feed/atom 

 It is the way Google does it. Here is a link to their js chrome extension:
 http://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/extensions/samples/gmail.zip 

 You will then be able to parse xml that looks like this: 

 &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;feed version="0.3" xmlns="http://purl.org/atom/ns#"&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Gmail - Inbox for yourmail@gmail.com&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;tagline&gt;New messages in your Gmail Inbox&lt;/tagline&gt;
&lt;fullcount&gt;142&lt;/fullcount&gt;
 
 #6 For a complete implementation of reading the value from the atom feed: 

 import urllib2
import base64
from xml.dom.minidom import parse

def gmail_unread_count(user, password):
 """
  Takes a Gmail user name and password and returns the unread
  messages count as an integer.
 """
 # Build the authentication string
 b64auth = base64.encodestring("%s:%s" % (user, password))
 auth = "Basic " + b64auth

 # Build the request
 req = urllib2.Request("https://mail.google.com/mail/feed/atom/")
 req.add_header("Authorization", auth)
 handle = urllib2.urlopen(req)

 # Build an XML dom tree of the feed
 dom = parse(handle)
 handle.close()

 # Get the "fullcount" xml object
 count_obj = dom.getElementsByTagName("fullcount")[0]
 # get its text and convert it to an integer
 return int(count_obj.firstChild.wholeText)
