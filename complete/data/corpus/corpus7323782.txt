Question (ID-7323782): Python: how to join entries in a set into one string? Basically, I am trying to join together the entries in a set in order to output one string. I am trying to use syntax similar to the join function for lists. Here is my attempt: 

 list = ["gathi-109","itcg-0932","mx1-35316"]
set_1 = set(list)
set_2 = set(["mx1-35316"])
set_3 = set_1 - set_2
print set_3.join(", ")
 

 However I get this error: AttributeError: 'set' object has no attribute 'join' 

 What is the equivalent call for sets? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 ', '.join(set_3)
 

 The join is a string method, not a set method. 
 #1 The join is called on the string: 

 print ", ".join(set_3)
 
 #2 Sets don't have a join method but you can use str.join instead. 

 ', '.join(set_3)
 

 The str.join method will work on any iterable object including lists and sets. 

 Note: be careful about using this on sets containing integers; you will need to convert the integers to strings before the call to join. For example 

 set_4 = {1, 2}
', '.join(str(s) for s in set_4)
 
 #3 I think you just have it backwards. 

 print ", ".join(set_3)
 
 #4 Nor the set nor the list has such method join , string has it: 

 ','.join(set(['a','b','c']))
 

 By the way you should not use name list for your variables. Give it a list_ , my_list or some other name because list is very often used python function. 
 #5 You have the join statement backwards try: 

 print ', '.join(set_3)
