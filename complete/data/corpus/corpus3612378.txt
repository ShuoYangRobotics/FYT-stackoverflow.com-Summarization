Question (ID-3612378): can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'float' level: beginner 

 why do i get error "can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'float'"? 

 def nestEgVariable(salary, save, growthRates):
 SavingsRecord = []
 fund = 0
 depositPerYear = salary * save * 0.01
 for i in growthRates: 
  fund = fund * (1 + 0.01 * growthRates) + depositPerYear
  SavingsRecord += [fund,]
 return SavingsRecord 


print nestEgVariable(10000,10,[3,4,5,0,3])
 

 thanks

 Answers (Total-6): #0 for i in growthRates:

 should be: 

 for i in growthRates: 
 fund = fund * (1 + 0.01 * i) + depositPerYear
 

 You are multiplying 0.01 with the growthRates list object. Multiplying a list by an integer is valid (it's overloaded syntactic sugar that allows you to create an extended a list with copies of its element references). 

 Example: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; 2 * [1,2]
[1, 2, 1, 2]
 
 #1 You're multipling your "1 + 0.01" times the growthRate list, not the item in the list you're iterating through. I've renamed i to rate and using that instead. See the updated code below: 

 def nestEgVariable(salary, save, growthRates):
 SavingsRecord = []
 fund = 0
 depositPerYear = salary * save * 0.01
 # V-- rate is a clearer name than i here, since you're iterating through the rates contained in the growthRates list
 for rate in growthRates: 
  #       V-- Use the `rate` item in the growthRate list you're iterating through rather than multiplying by the `growthRate` list itself.
  fund = fund * (1 + 0.01 * rate) + depositPerYear
  SavingsRecord += [fund,]
 return SavingsRecord 


print nestEgVariable(10000,10,[3,4,5,0,3])
 
 #2 In this line: 

 fund = fund * (1 + 0.01 * growthRates) + depositPerYear 

 growthRates is a sequence ( [3,4,5,0,3] ). You can't multiply that sequence by a float (0.1). It looks like what you wanted to put there was i . 

 Incidentally, i is not a great name for that variable. Consider something more descriptive, like growthRate or rate . 
 #3 In this line: 

 fund = fund * (1 + 0.01 * growthRates) + depositPerYear
 

 I think you mean this: 

 fund = fund * (1 + 0.01 * i) + depositPerYear
 

 When you try to multiply a float by growthRates (which is a list), you get that error. 
 #4 Because growthRates is a sequence (you're even iterating it!) and you multiply it by (1 + 0.01), which is obviously a float (1.01). I guess you mean for growthRate in growthRates: ... * growthrate ? 
 #5 Python allows for you to multiply sequences to repeat their values. Here is a visual example: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; [1] * 5
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
 

 But it does not allow you to do it with floating point numbers: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; [1] * 5.1
