Question (ID-3391998): Pydoc is not working (Windows XP) Using Windows XP and Python 2.7 I tried to run "pydoc" through the terminal. unfortunately it doesn't work. 

 Since I'm not allowed to post a screenshot (Newbie). Here is what it says (white on black) 

 What I type: 

 "C:\Python27&gt;pydoc raw_input /"pydoc raw_input"
 

 My result (It's German an it roughly translates to"The command "pydoc" is either spelled wrong or couldn't be found.): 

 Der Befehl "pydoc" ist entweder falsch geschrieben oder konnte nicht gefunden werden. 
 

 What am I doing wrong? 

 By the way, I just started to teach myself programming using Zed Shaws "Learn Python the Hard Way" and this is the first issue I really can't figure out using Google. I start to believe that it is Windows an not me... (being too broke to afford a Mac and to scared to learn Linux).

 % python -m pydoc &lt;params here&gt;
 

 worked. python will look for pydoc.py in the right directories without further ado. 
 #1 pydoc is actually a Python script (so, on Windows, you need to look for pydoc.py ), and it's not added to the Windows %PATH% by default (so you need to give a full pathname). 

 Try running c:\Python27\Lib\pydoc.py from your command line. 

 Edit: For a graphical interface to Python's documentation, you might want to instead run c:\Python27\Tools\Scripts\pydocgui.pyw (from the command line or from Windows Explorer). This starts pydoc's web server on your local PC so you can access the documentation through your web browser. 
 #2 There's no pydoc command in Windows. You'll need to specify the full path to pydoc.py . For example to start the pydoc GUI use: 

 python c:\Python26\lib\pydoc.py -g
 

 If you want to add the pydoc command, create a pydoc.bat file with the following line in it: 

 @python c:\Python26\lib\pydoc.py %*
 
 #3 The simplest way to do this would be to change to the Python27/Lib directory and run the command from there, like so: 

 
C:\Documents and Settings\username>cd C:\Python27\Lib

C:\Python27\Lib>python pydoc.py raw_input

 Check if path you've added to PATH is in there. Type in command line PATH.
If path you've added isn't there then Restart Windows. If it is go next line. 
 Type pydoc.py instead of pydoc 
 If you don't want type pydoc module extension every time, just add .PY extension 
to PATHEXT variable located at the same place as PATH variable does 
(Computer → Properties → Advanced system settings → Advanced → Environment Variables...
 → System Variables → PATHEXT). Restart your Windows after adding of extension. 
 
 #5 you can also type help() when you are in the Python terminal which gets you to the same page...
