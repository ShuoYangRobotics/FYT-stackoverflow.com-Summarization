Question (ID-477193): Suggestions for Python debugging tools? Yesterday I made a simulation using Python. I had a few difficulties with variables and debugging . 

 Is there any software for Python, which provides a decent debugger?

 #1 You can check out the python debugger pdb, which is included in the standard library: http://docs.python.org/library/pdb.html 
 #2 Komodo IDE (not the free Komodo Edit ) comes with a debugger. I haven't used it in over a year, but it was good back then (v 3, IIRC). 
 #3 I'd recommend pydb and ipython for interactive debugging. 

 Both have screencasts available at showmedo.com

 #4 pudb is a visual debugger for python. 

 
 #5 There is an Eclipse plug-in for Python which supports debugging, among other tools. See the The Tutorial to start with, and the Website for download. Off course you will need to get Eclipse as well.
