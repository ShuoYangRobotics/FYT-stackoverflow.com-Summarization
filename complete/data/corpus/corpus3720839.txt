Question (ID-3720839): Machine Learning Library? Which libraries do you use for machine learning for C/C++, Python, Java? 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 For Python: 

 
 MDP is a signal processing library, and allows you to easily build pipelines of algorithms 
 scikits.learn is a rapidly expanding collection of machine learning algorithm 
 
 #1 Python related: 

 Orange : data mining framework 
 NLTK : natural language processing and text analytics 
 Gensim : Vector Space Modelling 
 Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective : Although it's a book, we can touch the source code directly. 
 NumPy/SciPy related 
 Python related Machine Learning Library 

 If you really need a tons of Machine Learning packages for review.
MayBe http://mloss.org/software/ is the place. 
 #2 With Java, I find that Weka covers most of my needs. 
I've had less luck with PyML under Python but that's probably more of a matter of my lack of familiarity with PyML than effective limitations or shortcomings of this library. 
 #3 Weka (in Java) is definitely one of the most popular, and has been exposed to most other (including Python). 

 For C++, I recommend looking at Shark , but Shogun is also quite good. (see, also, this related SO question) . 
 #4 Weka is good. Rapid Miner is more comprehensive and more complicated. 
 #5 For a standalone library, I highly recommend libsvm (available in C++, python, and other languages). It's a good, standard support vectorm machine library that supports a lot of kernels. 
 #6 SVM-Light is a similar SVM library which has interfaces in many languages.
