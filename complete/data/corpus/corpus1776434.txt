Question (ID-1776434): couchDB , python and authentication I have installed couchDB v 0.10.0, and am attempting to talk to it via python from Couch class downloaded from couchDB wiki. Problem is: 

 Create database 'mydb': {'error': 'unauthorized', 'reason': 'You are not a server admin.'}
 

 I hand edited the local.ini file to include my standard osx login and password. I now have full access via futon but no joy WRT python. Is this an http header issue? 

 At a a loss - thanks! 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 You can also do: 

 db = couchdb.Database("http://your.url/yourdb")
db.resource.http.add_credentials(username, password)
 

 after which all your requests should work. 
 #1 The Couch class in the example does not pass any authentication information to the database, so it is not a miracle that it does not allow privileged operations. So your only options are: 

 
 disable authentication completely (as you mentioned) 
 pass the user name and password as part of the URI 
 pass the user name and password as an Authorization HTTP request header 
 

 If you want to pass a user name and a password, then you will need to change the Couch class. Sending an Authorization HTTP request header is easier, since the Couch class uses the httplib.HTTPConnection class. You can add such a header next to the Accept one this way: 

 headers = {
 "Accept": "application/json",
 "Authorization": "Basic " + 'username:password'.encode('base64')[:-1]}
 

 Same for the other HTTP request methods. 

 The documentation on the basic authentication is here:

 #2 To concour David's reply, (i.e. "This is how I do it using module CouchDB 0.8 in python 2.6 with couchdb 1.0.2") 

 couch = couchdb.Server(couch_server) 

 couch.resource.credentials = (USERNAME, PASSWORD) 
 #3 Just pass it as part of the URI...python-couchdb will parse the user/pass out and use them: 

 http://user:pass@localhost:5984 
 #4 There are several patches for python-couchdb that enable authentication. The code probably will be included in Version 0.7 but until then you can usr teh fork at http://github.com/mdornseif/couchdb-python - it allows you to use http://user%3Apass@127.0.0.1:5984/ type URLs. 

 http://blogs.23.nu/c0re/2009/12/running-a-couchdb-cluster-on-amazon-ec2/ (at the bottom) shows how to use CouchDB passwords. 
 #5 Don't forget to look at Couchdbkit (www.couchdbkit.org)
