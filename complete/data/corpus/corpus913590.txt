Question (ID-913590): django error 'too many values to unpack' I'm learning Django by building a simple recipes app. I have a 1 table model using the 'choices' field option for recipe categories rather than using a 2nd 'categories' table and a foreign key relationship. So i created db table via syncdb and then loaded table with test data. When i go to admin and click on the 'Recipes' link in an attempt to view recipes i get the following error: 

 Template error

In template /var/lib/python-support/python2.6/django/contrib/admin/templates/admin/change_list.html, error at line 34
Caught an exception while rendering: too many values to unpack
 

 If anyone can shed light on this cryptic error that would be great. Db is Sqlite. Django version is 1.0. The model is listed below: 

 from django.db import models

class Recipe(models.Model):
 CATEGORY_CHOICES = (
  (1, u'Appetizer'),
  (2, u'Bread'),
  (3, u'Dessert'),
  (4, u'Drinks'),
  (5, u'Main Course'),
  (6, u'Salad'),
  (7, u'Side Dish'),
  (8, u'Soup'),
  (9, u'Sauce/Marinade'),
  (10, u'Other'),  
 )
 name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
 submitter = models.CharField(max_length=40)
 date = models.DateTimeField()
 category = models.SmallIntegerField(choices=CATEGORY_CHOICES)
 ingredients = models.TextField()
 directions = models.TextField()
 comments = models.TextField(null=True, blank=True)
 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 If I had to guess, it's because whatever is in the administrative template expects a list of tuples, but you've instead supplied a tuple of tuples (hence the "too many values"). Try replacing with a list instead: 

 CATEGORY_CHOICES = [ # Note square brackets.
 (1, u'Appetizer'),
 (2, u'Bread'),
 (3, u'Dessert'),
 (4, u'Drinks'),
 (5, u'Main Course'),
 (6, u'Salad'),
 (7, u'Side Dish'),
 (8, u'Soup'),
 (9, u'Sauce/Marinade'),
 (10, u'Other'),  
]
 
 #1 Per http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/972 , you need to move the assignment CATEGORY_CHOICES = ... outside the class statement. 
 #2 I have encountered what I believe is this same error, producing the message: 

 Caught ValueError while rendering: too many values to unpack
 

 My form class was as follows: 

 class CalcForm(forms.Form):
 item = forms.ChoiceField(choices=(('17815', '17816')))
 

 Note that my choices type here is a tuple containing a tuple. Django official documentation reads as follows for the choices arg: 

 
 An iterable (e.g., a list or tuple) of 2-tuples to use as choices for
 this field. This argument accepts the same formats as the choices
 argument to a model field. 
 

 src: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/ref/forms/fields/#django.forms.ChoiceField.choices 

 And yet this problem went away after I changed it to a list of tuples: 

 class CalcForm(forms.Form):
 item = forms.ChoiceField(choices=[('17815', '17816')])
 

 After getting this to work, I wondered if perhaps the parentheses of the outtermost tuple in my initial code were being interpreted as denoting order of ops or some such thing and so I tried the following in hopes that it might make my intentions more explicit to the parser: 

 item = forms.ChoiceField(choices=(('17815', '17816'), ('123', '456')))
 

 But that doesn't work either and produced the same error. 

 Lesson: bugs happen. 
 #3 I got it working. Most of the 'too many values to unpack' errors that i came across while googling were Value Error types. My error was a Template Syntax type. To load my recipe table i had imported a csv file. I was thinking maybe there was a problem somewhere in the data that sqlite allowed on import. So i deleted all data and then added 2 recipes manually via django admin form. The list of recipes loaded after that. 

 thanks. 
 #4 I just had the same problem... my cvs file came from ms excel and the date fields gotten the wrong format at saving time. I change the format to something like '2010-05-04 13:05:46.790454' (excel gave me 5/5/2010 10:05:47) and voilaaaa no more 'too many values to unpackâ€™ 
 #5 You should use a ChoiceField instead of SmallIntegerField
