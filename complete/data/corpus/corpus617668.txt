Question (ID-617668): Looking for a self-contained equation rendering library Is there such a thing as a small, self-contained library that will render an equation written in a text-based format (e.g. LaTeX or MathML) to an image (either vector or raster)? 

 It would be preferable if it's in Python or Python-friendly. 

 (One possibility that I've found: Matplotlib has Python code to parse and display LaTeX equations, using gl2ps. If I don't find anything else it seems possible to extract all the relevant bits into a separate library.) 

 EDIT: by "self-contained" I mean they can't use TeX/LaTex itself since unfortunately I can't rely on it being installed 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 You can try to convert MathML to SVG . 
 #1 There's mimetex a stand alone program for rendering latex math... it's not a library however

 #2 jHepWork http://jwork.org/jhepwork/ 
 (version 2.7) generates PNG images from LaTex equations using Java/Jython.
 Latex equations can be included into Python (Jython) multiline
 comments using "$" or "$$" keywords (as for the standard LaTeX) 
 and then the program renders them into images embeded
 in HTML represenation of Python/Jython source code (CodeView feature) 
 #3 A versatile program and Python module to allow conversion of LaTeX math equations in to PNG images: http://code.google.com/p/latexmath2png/ (MIT license, relies on dvipng ). 
 #4 I don't know if this meets your requirements, but I knew MoinMoin has had latex extensions for a while so I looked again and found this: 

 MoinMoin Latex Support 

 You should be able to take this code and re-use it in your app. 
 #5 Maybe You need gnuplot 
 #6 Try ReforMath (http://reformath.webnode.com). It is C++ based and runs under both Windows and Linux. Although unfinished, it can render a number MathML elements.
