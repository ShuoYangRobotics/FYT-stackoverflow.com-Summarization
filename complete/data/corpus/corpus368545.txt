Question (ID-368545): How can i stop a While loop? i wrote a while loop in a function,but dont know how to stop it...when it doesnt meet its final condition,the loop just go for ever....how can i stop it?thanks in advance. 

 def determine_period(universe_array):
 period=0
 tmp=universe_array
 while True:
  tmp=apply_rules(tmp)#aplly_rules is a another function
  period+=1
  if numpy.array_equal(tmp,universe_array) is True:
   break #i want the loop to stop and return 0 if the 
      #period is bigger than 12
  if period&gt;12: #i wrote this line to stop it..but seems it 
      #doesnt work....help..
   return 0
  else: 
   return period
 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 def determine_period(universe_array):
 period=0
 tmp=universe_array
 while period&lt;12:
  tmp=apply_rules(tmp)#aplly_rules is a another function
  if numpy.array_equal(tmp,universe_array) is True:
   break 
  period+=1

 return period
 
 #1 just indent your code correctly: 

 def determine_period(universe_array):
 period=0
 tmp=universe_array
 while True:
  tmp=apply_rules(tmp)#aplly_rules is a another function
  period+=1
  if numpy.array_equal(tmp,universe_array) is True:
   return period
  if period&gt;12: #i wrote this line to stop it..but seems its doesnt work....help..
   return 0
  else: 
   return period
 

 You need to understand that the break statement in your example will exit the infinite loop you've created with while True . So when the break condition is True, the program will quit the infinite loop and continue to the next indented block. Since there is no following block in your code, the function ends and don't return anything. So I've fixed your code by replacing the break statement by a return statement. 

 Following your idea to use an infinite loop, this is the best way to write it: 

 def determine_period(universe_array):
 period=0
 tmp=universe_array
 while True:
  tmp=apply_rules(tmp)#aplly_rules is a another function
  period+=1
  if numpy.array_equal(tmp,universe_array) is True:
   break
  if period&gt;12: #i wrote this line to stop it..but seems its doesnt work....help..
   period = 0
   break

 return period
 
 #2 I recommend learning about pdb, and stepping through your code to see exactly what is going on. This will make debugging this kind of errors much easier in the future. 

 Learning how to use a debugger is one of the first skills a beginning programmer should develop.

 #3 The is operator in Python probably doesn't do what you expect. Instead of this: 

  if numpy.array_equal(tmp,universe_array) is True:
  break
 

 I would write it like this: 

  if numpy.array_equal(tmp,universe_array):
  break
 

 The is operator tests object identity, which is something quite different from equality. 
 #4 I would do it using a for loop as shown below : 

 def determine_period(universe_array):
 tmp = universe_array
 for period in xrange(1, 13):
  tmp = apply_rules(tmp)
  if numpy.array_equal(tmp, universe_array):
   return period
 return 0
 
 #5 Doesnâ€™t python have some kind of break statement?
