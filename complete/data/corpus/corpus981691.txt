Question (ID-981691): windows command line and Python I have a python script that i want to run from the command line but unsure how to run it. Thanks :) 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 I do it this way: 

 C:\path\to\folder&gt; yourscript.py
 
 #1 python myscript.py 
 #2 If your script is foo.py, you can simply do 

 C:\Python25\python.exe foo.py
 

 Assuming you have python 2.5 installed in the default location. Alternatively, you can add C:\Python25 to your %PATH%, so that: 

 python foo.py
 

 will work. But be aware that changing %PATH% may affect applications (that's why it is not done by the python installer by default). 
 #3 See Basic Hints for Windows Command Line Programming . 

 If your python installation directory is included in %PATH% - 

 C:\&gt; python myscript.py
 

 If you know the installation path: 

 C:\&gt; C:\python26\python myscript.py
 

 And, you can insert a hashbang in the 1st line of the script: 

 #! C:\python26\python
 

 and it will run by typing just the script name. This is the content of p.py : 

 #!C:\python26\python
import sys
print sys.path
 

 And calling it directly from a cmd.exe window: 

 C:\&gt;p.py
['C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\python26.zip', 'C:\\Python26\\DLLs',
'C:\\Python26\\lib', 'C:\\Python26\\lib\\plat-win',
'C:\\Python26', 'C:\\Python26\\lib\\site-packages', 
'C:\\Python26\\lib\\site-packages\\win32', 'C:\\Python26\\lib]
 
 #4 
 do you have python installed? if not
install it from python.org 
 on command line use 

 python "path to
 script.py" 
 if python is not in PATH
 list you can add it to PATH in
 environment variables or directly
 use path to python.exe e.g. 

  c:\python25\python.exe myscript.py
 
 
 #5 You might find it useful to include a .bat file which calls the .py script. Then all you need to do is to type the name of your script to run it. 

 Try something like:
python %~dp0\%~n0.py %*
