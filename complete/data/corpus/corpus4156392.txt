Question (ID-4156392): Fastest way to update a dictionary in python I have a dictionary A, and a possible entry foo. I know that A[foo] should be equal to x, but I don't know if A[foo] has been already defined. In any case if A[foo] has been defined it means that it already has the correct value. 

 It is faster to execute: 

 if foo not in A.keys(): 
 A[foo]=x 
 

 or simply update 

 A[foo]=x 
 

 because by the time the computer has found the foo entry, it can as well update it. While if not I would have to call the hash table two times? 

 Thanks. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 if foo not in A.keys(): 
 A[foo] = x 
 

 is very slow, because A.keys() creates a list, which has to be parsed in O(N). 

 if foo not in A: 
 A[foo] = x 
 

 is faster, because it takes O(1) to check, whether foo exists in A . 

 A[foo] = x 
 

 is even better, because you already have the object x and you just add (if it already does not exist) a pointer to it to A . 
 #1 Just add items to the dictionary without checking for their existence. I added 100,000 items to a dictionary using 3 different methods and timed it with the timeit module. 

 
 if k not in d: d[k] = v 
 d.setdefault(k, v) 
 d[k] = v 
 

 Option 3 was the fastest, but not by much. 

 [ Actually, I also tried if k not in d.keys(): d[k] = v , but that was slower by a factor of 300 (each iteration built a list of keys and performed a linear search). It made my tests so slow that I left it out here. ] 

 Here's my code: 

 import timeit

setup = """
import random
random.seed(0)
item_count = 100000
# divide key range by 5 to ensure lots of duplicates 
items = [(random.randint(0, item_count/5), 0) for i in xrange(item_count)]
"""
in_dict = """
d = {}
for k, v in items:
 if k not in d:
  d[k] = v
"""
set_default = """
d = {}
for k, v in items:
 d.setdefault(k, v)
"""
straight_add = """
d = {}
for k, v in items:
 d[k] = v
"""
print 'in_dict  ', timeit.Timer(in_dict, setup).timeit(1000)
print 'set_default ', timeit.Timer(set_default, setup).timeit(1000)
print 'straight_add ', timeit.Timer(straight_add, setup).timeit(1000)
 

 And the results: 

 in_dict  13.090878085
set_default 21.1309413091
straight_add 11.4781760635
 

 Note: This is all pretty pointless. We get many questions daily about what's the fastest way to do x or y in Python. In most cases, it is clear that the question was being asked before any performance issues were encountered. My advice? Focus on writing the clearest program you can write and if it's too slow, profile it and optimize where needed. In my experience, I almost never get to to profile and optimize step. From the description of the problem, it seems as if dictionary storage will not be the major bottle-neck in your program. 
 #2 There are certainly faster ways than your first example. But I suspect the straight update will be faster than any test. 
 #3 foo not in A.keys()
 

 will, in Python 2, create a new list with the keys and then perform linear search on it. This is guaranteed to be slower (although I mainly object to it because there are alternatives that are faster and more elegant/idiomatic). 

 A[foo] = x
 

 and 

 if foo not in A:
 A[foo] = x
 

 are different if A[foo] already exists but is not x . But since your "know" A[foo] will be x , it doesn't matter semantically . Anyway, both will be fine performance-wise (hard to tell without benchmarking, although intuitively I'd say the if takes much more time than copying a pointer). 

 So the answer is clear anyway: Choose the one that is much shorter code-wise and just as clear (the first one). 
 #4 A.setdefault(foo, x) but i'm not sure it is faster then if not A.has_key(foo): A[foo] = x . Should be tested. 
 #5 If you "know" that A[foo] "should be" equal to x, then I would just do: 

 assert(A[foo]==x)
 

 which will tell you if your assumption is wrong!
