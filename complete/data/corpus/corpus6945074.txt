Question (ID-6945074): PYTHON how to make as many variables as needed I have a loop that's reading over a text file. Each time the loop finds something different, I want it to make a new variable and assign the value in that line of text to the newly created variable. So if the text file looks like this: 

 3
3
6
1
3
6 

 The program would've made 3 variables, one for 1, one for 3, and one for 6. How can I do this> 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 What you likely want is this... 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; set("3 3 6 1 3 6".split())
set(['1', '3', '6'])
 
 #1 There are a couple approaches: 

 mydict = {}
for x in myfile.read().split():
 mydict[x] = None
print mydict
 

 Or: 

 class VarContainer(object):
 pass
v = VarContainer()
for x in myfile.read().split():
 setattr(v, 'var' + x, None)
print v.var3
 

 But what you're trying to do is a bit unclear. 
 #2 You can use the exec builtin to create variables. 

 Python 2.5.1 (r251:54863, May 18 2007, 16:56:43)
[GCC 3.4.4 (cygming special, gdc 0.12, using dmd 0.125)] on cygwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [3,3,6,1,3,6]
&gt;&gt;&gt; for e in a:
...  exec 'var%s = %e' % (e,e)
...
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; var3
3.0
&gt;&gt;&gt; var6
6.0
&gt;&gt;&gt; var1
1.0
&gt;&gt;&gt;
 

 EDIT 
This is a bad solution and should never be used. It is, however, important to know that something like this IS possible. 
 #3 You can store the values in an array: 

 (Assuming python 2.7)
 http://docs.python.org/library/array.html 

 You can then use array.index(x) to search if that value is already in the array, and array.append(x) to add it to the array 
 #4 Assuming text_file is some iterable, 

 def get_unique_numbers(text_file):
 temp = []
 for number in text_file:
  if number not in temp:
   temp.append(number)
 return temp
 
 #5 This code should do what you have asked for. 

 import sys 
from string import ascii_letters 

# Task 1, remove duplicate elements. 
def nodup(fn): 
 f = open(fn) 
 data = f.read().split() 

 res = [] 
 res.extend((i for i in data if i not in res)) 
 return res 

# Task 2, create the new variables on the fly 
module = sys.modules[__name__] 
filename = "data" 
for idx, value in enumerate(nodup(filename)): 
 setattr(module, ascii_letters[idx], value) 

print (a, b, c) 
# ('3', '6', '1')
