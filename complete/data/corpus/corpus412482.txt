Question (ID-412482): Resources for moving to Python What are good online resources to learn Python, quickly , for some who can code decently in other languages? 

 edit: It'll help if you could explain why you think that resource is useful.

 I have gone over it in a weekend or so and it was enough to learn almost all the idioms of the language and get the feeling of what is "the Python way" :-) 
 #1 Not sure if you already considered that, but documentation at the official site is very good. In particular, Tutorial lets you start quickly 
 #2 Code Like a Pythonista: Idiomatic Python 
 #3 My recommendation is to follow the standard tutorial (I find it very good) and, if you want to have a lot of fun while learning the language, definitely check out Python Challenge ( http://www.pythonchallenge.com/ ). 
 #4 Search "Alex Martelli - Python For Programmers" on Google Video. Good introductory (but fast-paced) talk. Related videos are also worth watching. 
 #5 My answer is to read and immediately buy Beazly's Python Essential Reference . 

 This book's introduction to the Python core language is the best I've seen, and it's written for experienced programmers looking to get up to speed on Python quickly, a.k.a. you.

 #7 I bookmarked this link on my Delicous when I was starting out - it's a bunch of links to Python tutorials. 
 I like Dive into Python and the standard documentation as well. It assumes you know the basics of how to program and concentrates of showing how to use Python - it uses some nice realistic and useful code to explain.
