Question (ID-1092531): Event system in Python What event system for Python do you use? I'm already aware of pydispatcher , but I was wondering what else can be found, or is commonly used? 

 I'm not interested in event managers that are part of large frameworks, I'd rather use a small bare-bones solution that I can easily extend. 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 We use an EventHook as suggested from Michael Foord in his Event Pattern : 

 Just add EventHooks to your classes with: 

 class MyBroadcaster()
	def __init__():
		self.onChange = EventHook()

theBroadcaster = MyListener()

# add a listener to the event
theBroadcaster.onChange += myFunction

# remove listener from the event
theBroadcaster.onChange -= myFunction

# fire event
theBroadcaster.onChange.fire()
 

 We add the functionality to remove all listener from an object to Michaels class and ended up with this: 

 class EventHook(object):

 def __init__(self):
  self.__handlers = []

 def __iadd__(self, handler):
  self.__handlers.append(handler)
  return self

 def __isub__(self, handler):
  self.__handlers.remove(handler)
  return self

 def fire(self, *args, **keywargs):
  for handler in self.__handlers:
   handler(*args, **keywargs)

 def clearObjectHandlers(self, inObject):
  for theHandler in self.__handlers:
   if theHandler.im_self == inObject:
    self -= theHandler
 
 #1 I use zope.event. It's the most bare bones you can imagine. :-)
In fact, here is the complete source code: 

 subscribers = []

def notify(event):
 for subscriber in subscribers:
  subscriber(event)
 

 Note that you can't send messages between processes, for example. It's not a messaging system, just an event system, nothing more, nothing less. 
 #2 PubSub is a pretty nice framework. 
 #3 I found this small script on Valued Lessons . It seems to have just the right simplicity/power ratio I'm after. Peter Thatcher is the author of following code (no licensing is mentioned). 

 class Event:
 def __init__(self):
  self.handlers = set()

 def handle(self, handler):
  self.handlers.add(handler)
  return self

 def unhandle(self, handler):
  try:
   self.handlers.remove(handler)
  except:
   raise ValueError("Handler is not handling this event, so cannot unhandle it.")
  return self

 def fire(self, *args, **kargs):
  for handler in self.handlers:
   handler(*args, **kargs)

 def getHandlerCount(self):
  return len(self.handlers)

 __iadd__ = handle
 __isub__ = unhandle
 __call__ = fire
 __len__ = getHandlerCount

class MockFileWatcher:
 def __init__(self):
  self.fileChanged = Event()

 def watchFiles(self):
  source_path = "foo"
  self.fileChanged(source_path)

def log_file_change(source_path):
 print "%r changed." % (source_path,)

def log_file_change2(source_path):
 print "%r changed!" % (source_path,)

watcher    = MockFileWatcher()
watcher.fileChanged += log_file_change2
watcher.fileChanged += log_file_change
watcher.fileChanged -= log_file_change2
watcher.watchFiles()
 
 #4 I've been doing it this way: 

 class Event(list):
 """Event subscription.

 A list of callable objects. Calling an instance of this will cause a
 call to each item in the list in ascending order by index.

 Example Usage:
 &gt;&gt;&gt; def f(x):
 ...  print 'f(%s)' % x
 &gt;&gt;&gt; def g(x):
 ...  print 'g(%s)' % x
 &gt;&gt;&gt; e = Event()
 &gt;&gt;&gt; e()
 &gt;&gt;&gt; e.append(f)
 &gt;&gt;&gt; e(123)
 f(123)
 &gt;&gt;&gt; e.remove(f)
 &gt;&gt;&gt; e()
 &gt;&gt;&gt; e += (f, g)
 &gt;&gt;&gt; e(10)
 f(10)
 g(10)
 &gt;&gt;&gt; del e[0]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; e(2)
 g(2)

 """
 def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
  for f in self:
   f(*args, **kwargs)

 def __repr__(self):
  return "Event(%s)" % list.__repr__(self)
 

 However, like with everything else I've seen, there is no auto generated pydoc for this, and no signatures, which really sucks. 
 #5 If I do code in pyQt I use QT sockets/signals paradigm, same is for django 

 If I'm doing async I/O I use native select module 

 If I'm usign a SAX python parser I'm using event API provided by SAX. So it looks like I'm victim of underlying API :-) 

 Maybe you should ask yourself what do you expect from event framework/module. My personal preference is to use Socket/Signal paradigm from QT. more info about that can be found here 
 #6 Here's another module for consideration. It seems a viable choice for more demanding applications. 

 
 Py-notify is a Python package
 providing tools for implementing
 Observer programming pattern. These
 tools include signals, conditions and
 variables. 
 
 Signals are lists of handlers that are
 called when signal is emitted.
 Conditions are basically boolean
 variables coupled with a signal that
 is emitted when condition state
 changes. They can be combined using
 standard logical operators (not, and,
 etc.) into compound conditions.
 Variables, unlike conditions, can hold
 any Python object, not just booleans,
 but they cannot be combined.
