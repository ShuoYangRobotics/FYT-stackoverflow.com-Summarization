Question (ID-6293421): Python, Printing multiple times, How can I repeat a string multiple times, multiple times? I know I can use a for loop, but I would like to repeat a string x times per row, over n rows. 

 For example, if the user enters 2 , the output would be: 

 @@

 Where x equals 2, and n equals 4.

 print "Your text here"
 

 Or 

 for i in range(3):
 print("Your text here")
 
 #1 EDIT : Old answer erased in response to updated question. 

 You just store the string in a variable: 

 separator = "!" * int(raw_input("Enter number: "))
print separator
do_stuff()
print separator
other_stuff()
print separator
 
 #2 E.g. if you want to print something 10 times you can write this: 

 print "-"*10
 

 or use a foor loop like suggested above: 

 for i in range(1,10):
  print "-"
 
 #3 The question is a bit unclear can't you just repeat the for loop? 

 a=[1,2,3]

for i in a:
 print i
1
2
3


for i in a:
 print i
1
2
3
 
 #4 So I take it if the user enters 2 , you want the output to be something like: 

 !!
!!
!!
!!
 

 Correct? 

 To get that, you would need something like: 

 rows = 4
times_to_repeat = int(raw_input("How many times to repeat per row? ")

for i in range(rows):
 print "!" * times_to_repeat
 

 That would result in: 

 How many times to repeat
 

 I have not tested this, but it should run error free.

 return (char*cols + '\n')*rows
