 Answers (Total-6): #0  max() 
 #1 max(number_one, number_two) 
 #2 Use the builtin function max. 

 Example: 
max(2, 4) returns 4. 

 just for giggles, there's a min as well...should you need it. :P 
 #3 You can use max(value, run) 

 The function max takes any number of arguments, or (alternatively) an iterable, and returns the maximum value. 
 #4 max(value,run)
 

 should do it. 
 #5 Just for the fun of it, after the party has finished and the horse bolted. 

 The answer is: max() !
