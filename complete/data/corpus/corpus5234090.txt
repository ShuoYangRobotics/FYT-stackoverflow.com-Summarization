Question (ID-5234090): How to take the top N items from a generator or list in Python? With LINQ I would 

 var top5 = array.Take(5);
 

 How to do this with Python? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 You can't slice a generator directly in python. You could use itertools.islice() as a helper function to do so. itertools.islice(generator, start, stop, step) Remember, slicing a generator will exhaust it partially. If you want to keep the entire generator intact, perhaps turn it into a tuple or list first: result = tuple(generator) 

 For a normal list, you can just use regular slicing. list[start:stop:step] 
You can omit "step", or either start/stop in either of these slice implementations. 

 list[:5] # grab the first five elements
 list[-5:] # grab the last five elements
   # (negative list indices start from the right side)

 import itertools
 itertools.islice(list, 0, 5) # grab the first five elements
 
 #1 import itertools

top5 = itertools.islice(array, 5)
 
 #2 Do you mean the first N items, or the N largest items? 

 If you want the first: 

 top5 = iterable[:5]
 

 This also works for the largest N items, assuming that your iterable is sorted in descending order. (Your LINQ example seems to assume this as well.) 

 If you want the largest, and it isn't sorted, it's easiest to sort it first: 

 l = list(iterable)
l.sort(reverse=True)
top5 = l[:5]
 
 #3 top5 = array[:5]
 

 (extra padding to make answer long enough to be submitted) 
 #4 This should work 

 top5 = array[:5] 
 
 #5 You have to use slices: 

 Try this: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; lst = [1,2,3,4,5]

&gt;&gt;&gt; lst[:2]
[1, 2]
 

 It takes from index 0 to index 2. 

 You can also do things like: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; lst = [1,2,3,4,5]

&gt;&gt;&gt; lst[2:4]

[3, 4]
