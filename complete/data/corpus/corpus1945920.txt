Question (ID-1945920): os.path.join python The below code will not join, when debugged the command does not store the whole path but just the last entry. 

 os.path.join('/home/build/test/sandboxes/', todaystr, '/new_sandbox/')
 

 When I test this it only stores the '/new_sandbox/' part of the code.
Can anyone help. 

 Thanks 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 The latter strings shouldn't start with a slash. If they start with a slash, then they're considered an "absolute path" and everything before them is discarded. 

 Quoting the Python docs for os.path.join : 

 
 If any component is an absolute path, all previous components (on Windows, including the previous drive letter, if there was one) are thrown away, and joining continues. 
 
 #1 It's because your '/new_sandbox/' begins with a / and thus is assumed to be relative to the root directory. Remove the leading / . 
 #2 do not use forward slashes at the beginning of path components, except when refering to the root dir: 

 os.path.join('/home/build/test/sandboxes', todaystr, 'new_sandbox')
 

 see also: http://docs.python.org/library/os.path.html#os.path.join 
 #3 Try with 'new_sandbox' only 

 os.path.join('/home/build/test/sandboxes/', todaystr, 'new_sandbox')
 
 #4 do it like this, without too the extra slashes 

 root="/home"
os.path.join(root,"build","test","sandboxes",todaystr,"new_sandbox")
 
 #5 The idea of os.path.join is to make your program cross-platform (linux/win32/etc). 

 Even one slash ruins it. 

 So it only makes sense when being used with some kind of reference point like
 os.environ['HOME'] or os.path.dirname(__file__)
