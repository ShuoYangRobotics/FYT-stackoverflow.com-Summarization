Question (ID-5314421): Naming variable, best convention What is the most used convention for naming variables in Python / Django?
ex: pub_date or pubdate 

 What about for classes and methods? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Django's coding style 
 #1 PEP 8 , nothing more to say. 

 Of course you can use your own style (I use camelCase, for example), but most people use recommendations from that PEP. 
 #2 Code Complete (http://www.cc2e.com/) has some great chapters about function/variable naming, not for Python explicitly, but perhaps still interesting... 
 #3 I use lower_case_with_underscore for variables, methods and functions. I think it really improves readability of the code. 

 For classes, I tend to use upper case the first letter: class NewsForm (forms.Form): 
 #4 The important thing is being consistent with your naming style. Choose one with your project mates and use it. Don't mix them. I personally use camelCase: 

 Sample class name: MyClass (capital letter at the beginning) 

 Sample method name: myMethod 

 Sample variable name: myVariable 

 Sample constant/enum name: MY_CONST 

 Class name should start with capital letter to make clear what it is in your code. Same about constants/enums. Values that don't change throughout your program should consist of capital letters. 
 #5 In addition to the correct references to PEP-8 and Django, let me add Google's Python style guide, which features a naming convention. It is here .
