Question (ID-7809698): Can you make multiple "if" conditions in Python? In JavaScript, one could do this: 

 if (integer &gt; 3 &amp;&amp; integer &lt; 34){
 document.write("Something")
}
 

 Is this possible in Python? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Python indeed allows you to do such a thing 

 if integer &gt; 3 and integer &lt; 34
 

 Python is also smart enough to handle: 

 if 3 &lt; integer &lt; 34:
 # do your stuff
 
 #1 if integer &gt; 3 and integer &lt; 34:
 # do work
 
 #2 yes like this: 

 if 3 &lt; integer &lt; 34:
 pass
 
 #3 Python replaces the usual C-style boolean operators ( &amp;&amp; , || , ! ) with words: and , or , and not respectively. 

 So you can do things like: 

 if (isLarge and isHappy) or (isSmall and not isBlue):
 

 which makes things more readable. 
 #4 Just on formatting. If you have very long conditions, I like this way of formatting 

 if (isLarge and isHappy) \
or (isSmall and not isBlue):
  pass
 

 It fits in nicely with Python's comb formatting 
 #5 Yes, it is: 

 if integer &gt; 3 and integer &lt; 34:
 document.write("something")
