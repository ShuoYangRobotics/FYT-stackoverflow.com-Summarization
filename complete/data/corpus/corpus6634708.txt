Question (ID-6634708): TypeError: 'dict' object is not callable Can some one please explain this. 

 number_map = { 1: -3, 2: -2, 3: -1, 4: 1, 5: 2, 6: 3 }
input_str = raw_input("Enter something: ")
strikes = [number_map(int(x)) for x in input_str.split()]

strikes = [number_map(int(x)) for x in input_str.split()]
TypeError: 'dict' object is not callable
 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 The syntax for accessing a dict given a key is number_map[int(x)] . number_map(int(x)) would actually be a function call but since number_map is not a callable, an exception is raised. 
 #1 strikes = [number_map [ int(x) ] for x in input_str.split()] 

 You get an element from a dict using these [] brackets, not these () . 
 #2 it's number_map[int(x)] , you tried to actually call the map with one argument 
 #3 You need to use: 

 number_map[int(x)]
 

 Note the square brackets! 
 #4 strikes = [number_map[int(x)] for x in input_str.split()]
 

 Use square brackets to explore dictionaries. 
 #5 Access the dictionary with square brackets. 

 strikes = [number_map[int(x)] for x in input_str.split()]
