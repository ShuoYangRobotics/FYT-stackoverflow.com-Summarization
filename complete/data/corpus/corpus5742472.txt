 #1 Eclipse with Pydev 

 nothing better out there 
 #2 Pytools should add intellisense for python to visual studio if you are developing on windows. I have not tried it myself so I don't know how good it works. 
 #3 well, many IDEs now come with pretty good code completion. Eclipse with pydev is nice, or you can get aptana studio 3 to perform similar to it.
Theres also jetbrain's PyCharm, if you don't mind paying for a licence (they do give a trial version too if you want to test it before buying). There are a lot of such IDEs, guess you have to try them out to see which suits your code completion tastes better. 
 #4 PyCharm for pay or Komodo Edit for free. 
 #5 Komodo has since long time an excellent Python support 
 #6 I have also been searching for a good IDE for Python development. I tried using Emacs and Komodo but finally settled for PyCharm . It does a really good job at auto completing the code and I find it to be worth the money. 

 Depending on the type of development you do, you could get a discounted or even a free license.
