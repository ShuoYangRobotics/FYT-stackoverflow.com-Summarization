Question (ID-4843058): What's the Python equivalent of x = (10 I was wondering what the equivalent in python to this would be: 

 n = 100
x = (10 &lt; n) ? 10 : n;
print x;
 

 For some reason this does not work in Python. I know I can use an if statement but I was just curious if there is some shorter syntax. 

 Thanks. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 x = min(n, 10)
 

 Or, more generally: 

 x = 10 if 10&lt;n else n
 
 #1 Here is the ternary operator in Python (also know as conditional expressions in the docs). 

 x if cond else y
 
 #2 There are various ways to make a ternary operation, the first one is the expression added with 2.5: 

 n = foo if condition else bar
 

 If you want to be compatible with versions lower than 2.5 you can exploit the fact that booleans are subclasses from int and that True behaves like 1 whereas False behaves like 0 : 

 n = [bar, foo][condition]
 

 Another possibility is to exploit the way operators in Python behave or more exactly how and and or behave: 

 n = condition and foo or bar
 
 #3 &gt;&gt;&gt; n = 100
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 10 if n &gt; 10 else n
&gt;&gt;&gt; x
10
 
 #4 10 if 10 &lt; n else n 
 

 see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_operation 
 #5 x = 10 if (10 &lt; n) else n
 

 (requires python 2.5)
