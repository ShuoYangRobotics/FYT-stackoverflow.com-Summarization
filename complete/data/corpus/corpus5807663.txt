 Answers (Total-6): #0 Mount your Windows partition with "exec" option - on some distros it's "noexec" by default. 
 #1 Did you include 

 #!/usr/bin/python
 

 as your first line? 
 #2 You should be able to run the script typing: 

 $ chmod 755 ./scripts/replace-md5sums.py
$ ./scripts/replace-md5sums.py
 

 There are times where the user you are currently logged with just don't have the permission to change file mode bits. In such cases if you have the root password you can change the file permission this way: 

 $ sudo chmod 755 ./scripts/replace-md5sums.py
 
 #3 does the scripts directory have the x rights for your user ? (something like this in the output of ls -l drwx r-x r-x ) 
 #4 I solved my problem. it's just the version of python which the interpreter reads off the first line. removing to version numbers did it for me, i.e. 

 #!/usr/bin/python2.7 --&gt; #!/usr/bin/python
 
 #5 #strace ./scripts/replace-md5sums.py
