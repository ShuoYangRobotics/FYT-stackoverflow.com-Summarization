Question (ID-207939): Python module that implements ftps I was wondering if anybody could point me towards a free ftps module for python. 

 I am a complete newbie to python, but this is something I need for a work project. I need an ftps client to connect to a 3rd party ftps server. 

 thanks, 

 David. 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 I believe you could use Twisted to implement FTPS by simply using its FTP implementation, but changing the FTPClient.connectFactory attribute to be a function that does something with connectSSL rather than connectTCP . 

 Are you sure you want FTPS though? SFTP is a different, better, and much more popular protocol these days: Twisted contains an SFTP implementation as well. 
 #1 Twisted seems to have some implementation of FTPS (FTP over SSL) under the conch sub-project. I am no twisted expert, but Glyph , the twisted man himself, is listed in this site. Maybe by following his answer to another question, you can find more details (good luck). 
 #2 M2Cypto has a FTPS module. From the documentation : 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; from M2Crypto import ftpslib
&gt;&gt;&gt; f = ftpslib.FTP_TLS()
&gt;&gt;&gt; f.connect('', 9021)
'220 spinnaker.dyndns.org M2Crypto (Medusa) FTP/TLS server v0.07 ready.'
&gt;&gt;&gt; f.auth_tls()
&gt;&gt;&gt; f.set_pasv(0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; f.login('ftp', 'ngps@')
'230 Ok.'
&gt;&gt;&gt; f.retrlines('LIST')

 Alternatively, if you wanted to minimise use of third-party modules, you should be able to subclass the standard library's ftplib .FTP class with the built-in (to Python) SSL support. M2Crypto (or Twisted , if you want to go that way) is the easier solution, though. 
 #3 The ftplib module in Python version 2.7.1 has all of the functionality you will need, including TLS support. 

 http://docs.python.org/library/ftplib.html#module-ftplib 
 #4 I haven't tried it myself (yes, I just used Google and followed some links), but http://www.lag.net/paramiko/ seems to be the recommended solution. From a cursory glance, it's an SSH implementation in pure Python, which allows tunneling for things like FTP. 

 Update: a commenter pointed out that I mixed up sftp and ftps, sorry. I still suggest at least investigating Paramiko briefly to see if it matches the requirements. 
 #5 As for the server implementation you can take a look at pyftpdlib:
 http://code.google.com/p/pyftpdlib/ 
It includes a demo script implementing a working FTPS server:
 http://code.google.com/p/pyftpdlib/source/browse/trunk/demo/tls_ftpd.py 

 As for the client implementation I provided a patch which will be included in python 2.7 and 3.2.
 http://bugs.python.org/issue2054 
 #6 I couldn't find a free sftp client for windows so I ended up wrapping Putty's PSFTP using python's subprocess module.
I probably would have used the twisted implementation mentioned by Glyph if i'd known about it. 

 Anyway if your interested it's available at:
