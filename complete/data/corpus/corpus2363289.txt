Question (ID-2363289): regular expression to extract @name symbols from tweet I would like to use regular expression to extract only @patrick @michelle from the following sentence: 

 @patrick @michelle we having diner @home tonight do you want to join?
 

 Note: @home should not be include in the result because, it is not at beginning of the sentence nor is followed by another @name . 

 Any solution, tip, comments will be really appreciated.

 It first matches either an "@" followed by many non-space characters, or the start of line, and then matches another "@" followed by many non-space characters. 

 Note that it's common in Twitter that @name is preceded by RT , appears in the middle or end of the tweet e.g. http://twitter.com/ceetee/statuses/9874073403 . Basically you can't distinguish whether a @name is really a name just using RegEx or even a parser. The best bet is to check if http://twitter.com/name 404 or not. 
 #1 Well, at first I thought this failed because I looked at the groups that are returned: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; tw = re.compile(r"^((@\w*)\s+)*")
&gt;&gt;&gt; tw.findall(tweet)
[('@michelle ', '@michelle')]
&gt;&gt;&gt; tw.match(tweet).groups()
('@michelle ', '@michelle')
 

 Note that the groups only keep the last value for any group in the re. But if you just grab group(), then you get the whole matched string: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; tw.match(tweet).group()
'@patrick @michelle '
 

 For grins, I'll try pyparsing: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; from pyparsing import Word, printables, OneOrMore
&gt;&gt;&gt; atName = Word("@",printables)
&gt;&gt;&gt; OneOrMore(atName).parseString(tweet).asList()
['@patrick', '@michelle']
 
 #2 Try this regular expression: 

 /^\s*@(\w+)\s+@(\w+)/
 

 \s denotes whitespace characters and \w word characters. 
 #3 As long as it starts with an @ and continues with those this will do it I tested it in poweshell so some regex engines are a bit different. This should also catch n names at the beginning of the line 

 "^((@\w+)\s)+" 
 #4 Perhaps something like this, though you'll have to split on whitespace anything in the matching group to extract multiple ids. 

 /^\s*(@\w+\s+)*\s+.*$/
 
 #5 You have tagged your post c#, so I assume you can use the .NET Regex imnplementation.
Using .NET, the following Regex will do: 

 (?&lt;![^@]\w+\s+)(@\w+)
 

 This will match any words starting with @, that do not have a word without @ before them.
Note that "dinner @home @8pm" will still break it, though. 

 See here for more details. 
 #6 for PHP 

 /^\s*@(\w+)\s+@(\w+)/
 

 Thanks KennyM 

 in python 

 msg = '@patrick @michelle we having diner @home tonight do you want to join?'
import re
re.findall('(?:(?:@\S+\s+)+|^)@\S+', msg)
 

 This works with 1 or n @name at the beginning of the sentence. 

 Thank you all for the quick replies. 
 #7 In Perl, you can exploit the /g match-more-than-once modifier combined with the \G zero-width where-we-left-off assertion and list context, thus: 

 my $str = '@patrick @michelle we having diner @home tonight do you want to join?';
my @matches = ($str =~ m/\G(\@\w+)\s*/g);

print join(', ', @matches) . "\n";
 

 This should be robust across any number of initial @-strings.

It will also give you the links and the tags. 

 And beware of using a simple regex, you will end up with a big mess, as I did before I converted the Twitter Text Java Library.
