Question (ID-1969937): Iteration WAS working in my script, now I cant get python to iterate - what happened? Did my python ide break or something? 

 import sys

i = 0
sample = ("this", "is", "Annoying!")

for line in sample:
 print i, line
 i + 1
 

 Now gives me... 

 
0 this 
0 is 
0 Annoying!
 

 I THOUGHT, it would give me: 

 
1 this 
2 is 
3 Annoying
 

 I had other scripts that I was working on and it they all just broke - they all have the same line number when they print numerous iterations using the for statement - can someone PLEASE tell me what the heck is going on - very frustrated lol... did Python break? Do I need sleep? What is wrong here? 
 Answers (Total-8): #0 While the other answers are correct, this is how you usually do this in python: 

 sample = ("this", "is", "Annoying!")

for i, line in enumerate(sample):
 print i, line
 

 The enumerate function does exactly what you want: Iterating through your tuple, while at the same time giving you (line) numbers. 
 #1 You are calculating i+1 but are not storing the result of that anywhere. Specifically you are not updating i to contain the new value. Use i = i + 1 or i += 1 instead. 
 #2 This works just fine for me: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; import sys
&gt;&gt;&gt; i = 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; sample = ("abc", "def", "ghi")
&gt;&gt;&gt; for line in sample:
... i = i + 1
... print i, line
... 
1 abc
2 def
3 ghi
 

 Are you sure you're incrementing and storing the value i ? (Your sample omits this, but in another answer you say you did put i = i + 1 .) Remember, Python is whitespace-sensitive, so if you did something like this, the result won't be what you expect: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; for line in sample:
... print i, line
... i = i + 1 # &lt;-- This is not part of the loop!
 
 #3 I suspect you have an indentation problem, that perhaps the i = i + 1 statement is somehow not part of the for-loop. 

 But Instead of doing your own counter incrementing, better practice is to use enumerate: 

 for i,line in enumerate(sample):
 print i,line
 
 #4 The problem is you're doing "i + 1", not "i=i+1" 
 #5 You're not incrementing the variable i in your code, you'd need to do something like: 

 for line in sample:
 i = i + 1
 print i, line
 
 #6 The result that you expect would be obtained by using enumerate: 

 sample = ("this", "is", "Annoying!")
for index, line in enumerate(sample):
 print index, line
 

 I don't see how the code that you posted ever would have worked in any version of Python. 
 #7 Just step through debugger to see the execution.
