Question (ID-2146383): HTTPS connection Python I am trying to verify the that target exposes a https web service. I have code to connect via HTTP but I am not sure how to connect via HTTPS. I have read you use SSL but I have also read that it did not support certificate errors. The code I have got is from the python docs: 

 import httplib
conn = httplib.HTTPConnection("www.python.org")
conn.request("GET", "/index.html")
r1 = conn.getresponse()
print r1.status, r1.reason
 

 Does anyone know how to connect to HTTPS? 

 I already tried the HTTPSConenction but it responds with an error code claiming httplib does not have attribute HTTPSConnection. I also don't have socket.ssl available. 

 I have installed Python 2.6.4 and I don't think it has SSL support compiled into it. Is there a way to integrate this suppot into the newer python without having to install it again. 

 I have installed OpenSSL and pyOpenSsl and I have tried the below code from one of the answers: 

 import urllib2
from OpenSSL import SSL
try: 
 response = urllib2.urlopen('https://example.com') 
 print 'response headers: "%s"' % response.info() 
except IOError, e: 
 if hasattr(e, 'code'): # HTTPError 
  print 'http error code: ', e.code 
 elif hasattr(e, 'reason'): # URLError 
  print "can't connect, reason: ", e.reason 
 else: 
  raise
 

 I have got an error: 

  Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 2, in &lt;module&gt;
 File "/home/build/workspace/downloads/Python-2.6.4/Lib/urllib.py", line 87, in urlopen
 return opener.open(url)
 File "/home/build/workspace/downloads/Python-2.6.4/Lib/urllib.py", line 203, in open
 return self.open_unknown(fullurl, data)
 File "/home/build/workspace/downloads/Python-2.6.4/Lib/urllib.py", line 215, in open_unknown
 raise IOError, ('url error', 'unknown url type', type)
IOError: [Errno url error] unknown url type: 'https'
 

 Does anyone know how to get this working?

 I have found out what the problem was, the Python version I was using did not have support for SSL. I have found this solution currently at: http://www.webtop.com.au/compiling-python-with-ssl-support . 

 The code will now work after this solution which is very good. When I import ssl and HTTPSConnection I know don't get an error. 

 Thanks for the help all. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 http://docs.python.org/library/httplib.html : 

 
 Note: HTTPS support is only available if the socket module was compiled with SSL support. 
 

 #!/usr/bin/env python

import httplib
c = httplib.HTTPSConnection("ccc.de")
c.request("GET", "/")
response = c.getresponse()
print response.status, response.reason
data = response.read()
print data
# =&gt; 
# 200 OK
# &lt;!DOCTYPE html ....
 

 To verify if SSL is enabled, try: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; import socket
&gt;&gt;&gt; socket.ssl
&lt;function ssl at 0x4038b0&gt;
 
 #1 using 

 class httplib.HTTPSConnection
 

 http://docs.python.org/library/httplib.html#httplib.HTTPSConnection 
 #2 Why haven't you tried httplib.HTTPSConnection? It doesn't do SSL validation but this isn't required to connect over https.
Your code works fine with https connection: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; import httplib
&gt;&gt;&gt; conn = httplib.HTTPSConnection("mail.google.com")
&gt;&gt;&gt; conn.request("GET", "/")
&gt;&gt;&gt; r1 = conn.getresponse()
&gt;&gt;&gt; print r1.status, r1.reason
200 OK
 
 #3 Assuming SSL support is enabled for the socket module. 

 connection1 = httplib.HTTPSConnection('www.somesecuresite.com')
 
 #4 To check for ssl support in Python 2.6+ : 

 try:
 import ssl
except ImportError:
 print "error: no ssl support"
 

 To connect via https : 

 import urllib2

try:
 response = urllib2.urlopen('https://example.com') 
 print 'response headers: "%s"' % response.info()
except IOError, e:
 if hasattr(e, 'code'): # HTTPError
  print 'http error code: ', e.code
 elif hasattr(e, 'reason'): # URLError
  print "can't connect, reason: ", e.reason
 else:
  raise
