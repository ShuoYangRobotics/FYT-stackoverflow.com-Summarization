Question (ID-4800919): Which are good hands-on ("learn-by-doing") books about Python? Are there books like Learning Python the Hard Way where you have to write out code along the book? 
I find a lot of books just 'talk at you'. The Head First series of books are supposed to be good at this but I didn't like their Python series. 

 Recommendations anyone? 

 Update 
I have zero programming background. Been messing around with Python last couple of weeks. 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 There is Dive Into Python which leads you by example. Also, if you prefer Head first series, there is Head First Python available too. 
 #1 There are tons of (free) resources for learning Python. The Python docs provides a tutorial. You may want to try this: http://learnpythonthehardway.org/static/LearnPythonTheHardWay.pdf 

 Learning a new language is often like writing...you just need to start typing 
 #2 If you have 0 programming background, Non-Programmer's Tutorial for Python is very good. 
 #3 I really like ""Core Python Programming" by Wesley Chun. Lots of exercises. 
 #4 Check out Python by Example (a web page). 
 #5 You can also start on trypython.org , a website. It starts from the basics and might be what you are looking for. 
 #6 try http://www.zacharski.org/books/python-for-linguists/ 
it's focusing on analysing texts but the examples are really clear
