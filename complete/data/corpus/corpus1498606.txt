Question (ID-1498606): book recommendations for perl type programming in python or ruby My programming experience: I know Java, understand OOP and know some recursion. 

 I would like to learn how to write "scripts" for text processing, file handling and stuff like that. I'm fine with learning either Ruby or Python for this. I want a book that focuses on what I've mentioned above but most books just teach more than that (OOP, Data Structures...) and I don't have enough time for those. 

 So far, the book that I think is the most suitable is actually Learning Perl (the Llama book) as it is only 300+ pages long and teach what I want to learn. However, I don't wanna learn Perl. 

 So, in short, is there any Python or Ruby book that teaches what Learning Perl teaches? 
 Answers (Total-11): #0 Why don't you want to learn Perl? It's a great language and a fine introduction to the world of scripting. And as you've found it has some of the best introductory texts out there. 

 I happen to be a long-time Perl programmer now working mostly in Python and I can't say I've seen anything to equal Learning Perl. I got my feet wet with Dive Into Python, and it's a good book but hardly suitable for a beginner. 

 Since you mentioned Ruby though, I have to say that Why's (Poignant) Guide to Ruby is hilarious and absolutely worth a read: 

 http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/ 

 It's a shame he had to go. 
 #1 The Llama book is a bit more "tutorial-like" that the following recommendation, but in you choose Python, you'll find the Python Cookbook O'Reilly pub. (Martelli, Ravenscroft and Asher) quite insightful. 

 Like the Llama, its chapters are structured around functional areas (file I/O, Searching and Sorting, Databases/Persitence, Debugging, User Interface, XML...). As with "cookbooks" the chapters are collections of task-oriented recipes, but beyond the working snippets, you get a good explanation of what and how things are done, along with references, some online, if you wish to dig further. 

 In a nutshell, a great book for both beginners and advanced Python programmers, without the "programming 101" type of presentation you wish to avoid. 
 #2 For your specific needs I would suggest these 2 books: 

 Learning Ruby 

 Everyday Scripting in Ruby 

 Please note that the Learning Ruby book is EXTREMELY ELEMENTARY possibly more so than Learning Perl. If you want a more robust treatment of ruby at the beginners level than I would recommend this one: 

 Pickaxe Programming Ruby 
 #3 O'Reilly books are pretty good. 

 The Ruby Programming Language 

 Learning Python 

 Then there is the pickaxe book for Ruby. 

 Programming Ruby 1.9: The Pragmatic Programmers' Guide 

 However, if your just wanting to do some basic stuff, like the text processing and file handling that you mention, then using Google is a good choice. There is a lot of information on the web for free about these topics that you can find through some simple searches. 
 #4 I'm rubyist, so my advice is about Ruby only. 

 1) At first, you should give a look to try Ruby in your browser 

 2) There is single book for studying Ruby - Programming Ruby.
The Pragmatic Programmer's Guide (it's on Amazon for purchase as well as on the official site for reading) It could be used as reference, not as coursebook - you know all the basics from the first point. 

 3)Don't forget to use irb - it is interactive Ruby shell. Excellent for testing some code, and experiments 

 Merry coding! 
 #5 Text Processing in Python by David Mertz 
 #6 Don't overlook Practical Ruby for System Administration by 
Andr√© Ben Hamou which is a great book with a terrible name. Andre comes from a Perl background (amongst a lot else). He goes through all kinds of practical examples such as: 

 
 one-liners like: 

 $ ruby -ne 'puts $_ if $_ =~ /andre/' /etc/passwd /etc/group
 
 extending the built-in File class to provide open_locked and open_safely methods 
 using metaprogramming techniques to make a DSL allowing a server to be configured with: 

 server "bitbucket.example.com" do |srv| 
 srv.shares "/homes", :over =&gt; ["afp", "smb"], :as =&gt; "HOMES" 
end 
 
 

 It's a funny and wide-reaching book which covers a lot of ground and includes some tricks (and opinions) I've not seen anywhere else. 
 #7 the ruby book recommendations above are good, there are a bunch more on Amazon. The OO models for ruby, python and Java are different, it's worth looking at that stuff. The perl OO model stands apart (I think that's a nice euphemism!) 

 

 python: I like the Pilgrim and Hetlund books 

 http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Python-Novice-Professional-Second/dp/1590599829/ 

 http://diveintopython.org/toc/index.html 

 Again, a bunch more on Amazon. 
 #8 Actually I've been thinking about this a little more and I think this book is an excellent resource for a beginner looking to learn ruby. Not only does it go through the basics but it teaches oop at a beginner level quite effectively. It is also a pleasure to read and actually keeps the readers asttention and interest (which the majority of technical books fail so thoroughly to do!). All in all this book is a gem (pun intended!!), well worth the 40 bucks you can get it for at amazon: 

 Design Patterns in Ruby 
 #9 No book, but the PLEAC project aims to implement the solutions from the Perl Cookbook in many other languages , also ruby and python. Not all topics are fully covered, but topics like Strings are. 
 #10 Books with examples in Ruby, Python, Perl , etc...
