Question (ID-1991428): Execute Scripts online I'm searching for a website where I can test python scripts within a simple form (so I don't need to install python on my local machine). I know there is a site that can do it (also other script languages like javascript, php are supported...) but I forget the name.
Anyone can help me? Thanks! 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 There is also Google's App Engine Interactive shell . 

 EDIT: How could I forget the Lord of the REPLs ? Here it is . Supported languages: 

 
 beanshell 
 clojure 
 groovy 
 javascript 
 python 
 ruby 
 scala 
 scheme 
 
 #1 http://codepad.org/ 
 #2 Here is it. 
 #3 There is http://www.trypython.org/ but you need to have silverlight installed. 
 #4 http://ideone.com/ is a pastebin that allows you to execute the code with supplied input. It supports a ridiculous range of languages: ada, assembler, awk, bash, bc, brainfuck, c, c#, c++, cobol, clisp, d, erlang, forth, fortran, haskell, icon, java, javascript, lua, ocaml, pascal, perl, php, pike, prolog, python, ruby, scala, scheme, smalltalk, tcl, vala and vb. 
 #5 I like sage . It's also useful for testing other mathematical tools (mathematica, matlab, latex...)
