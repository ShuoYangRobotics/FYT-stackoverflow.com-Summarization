Question (ID-6378889): How to convert a string list into an integer in python In my python Script I have: 

 user = nuke.getInput("Frames Turned On") 

 userLst = [user] 

 print userLst 

 Result: ['12,33,223'] 

 I was wondering How I would remove the ' in the list, or somehow convert it into int? 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 Use split() to split at the commas, use int() to convert to integer: 

 user_lst = map(int, user.split(","))
 
 #1 There's no ' to remove in the list. When you print a list, since it has no direct string representation, Python shows you its repr â€”a string that shows its structure. You have a list with one item, the string 12,33,223 ; that's what [user] does. 

 You probably want to split the string by commas, like so: 

 user_list = user_input.split(',')
 

 If you want those to be int s, you can use a list comprehension : 

 user_list = [int(number) for number in user_input.split(',')]
 
 #2 [int(s) for s in user.split(",")]
 

 I have no idea why you've defined the separate userLst variable, which is a one-element list. 
 #3 &gt;&gt;&gt; result = ['12,33,223']
&gt;&gt;&gt; int(result[0].replace(",", ""))
1233233
&gt;&gt;&gt; [int(i) for i in result[0].split(',')]
[12, 33, 233]
 
 #4 &gt;&gt;&gt; ast.literal_eval('12,33,223')
(12, 33, 223)
 
 #5 Think that it would be good to add a simple check(it is better to check that user eneter numeric value at least) on the values entered: 

 inputData = ['12,33,223']
[int(i) for i in inputData.split(',') if i.isnumeric()]
 
 #6 You could use the join method and convert that to an integer: 

 int(''.join(userLst))
