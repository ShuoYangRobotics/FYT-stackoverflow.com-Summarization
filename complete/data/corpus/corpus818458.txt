 #1 I found Thinking in Tkinter very helpful for getting my head around the concepts of GUI programming (notably, packing widgets inside other widgets, and binding callbacks to events). 
 #2 This is what I used: Pythonware -- An introduction to TKinter . 

 I quickly switched to PyQT , though :) 
 #3 Mark Lutz's tome Programming Python deals at length with Tkinter. The Introduction to Tkinter ( effbot.org) and Tkinter reference: a GUI for Python (John Shipman, New Mexico Tech) are good summaries of the major features. I have read that the Tk/Tcl manual is a good reference but that might be for later. 
 #4 Here are several video series on building python GUIs that got me started 
 #5 If you learn best from video, Charlie, I recommend http://showmedo.com/videotutorials/video?name=pythonShawnTkinter1&amp;fromSeriesID=58 ; if from books, http://www.manning.com/grayson/ . For a free online tutorial, I second bedwyr's advice -- and I especially second his (implicit;-) advice to use PyQt instead. (A web search for pyqt tutorial shows many pointers). 
 #6 You have the source for idle. That shows useful tkinter code. 
 #7 I just came across http://www.shido.info/py/python6_e.html which looks very handy 
 #8 I used Manning's book on Tkinter, as someone else mentioned. The tutorials are very thorough, and you quickly get into the habit of thinking like a GUI coder. The New Mexico Tech worksheet is useful as a reference, but a bit too clumsy for a first resource.
