Question (ID-4271740): How can I use python to get the system name? Note: I do NOT mean "Window XP", "Linux", "OS X", etc. 

 I'm writing a chat program for a local network. I would like to know who says what so I would like to use python to get the user-set computer name(The name of the computer when you view the local network. e.g. "Laptop", "John", etc.) Any suggestions? 

 Another note: The network is already set up(file sharing, VNC, etc). I do not need help with that. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Use socket and the gethostname() functionality. This will get the hostname of the computer where the python interpreter is running: 

 import socket
print socket.gethostname()
 
 #1 Both of these are pretty portable: 

 import platform
platform.node()

import socket
socket.gethostname()
 

 Any solutions using the HOST or HOSTNAME environment variables are not portable. Even if it works on your system when you run it, it may not work when run in special environments such as cron. 
 #2 If I'm correct, you're looking for the socket.gethostname function: 

 &gt;&gt; import socket
&gt;&gt; socket.gethostname()
'terminus'
 
 #3 socket.gethostname() could do 
 #4 You could import the os module and pull it out of the environment via os.getenv : 

 import os
system_name = os.getenv('HOSTNAME')
 
 #5 What about : 

 import platform

h = platform.uname()[1]
 

 Actually you may want to have a look to all the result in platform.uname()
