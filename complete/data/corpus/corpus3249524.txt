Question (ID-3249524): Print in one line dynamically. Python How to print in python in one line. 

 Suppose I have iteration 

 for iten in range(1,100):
 print item
 

 It give me 

 1
2
3
4
......
 

 but I want to be result like this 

 1 2 3 4 5 ...................
 

 By the way...... How to refresh it every time so it print mi in one place just change the number. 
 Answers (Total-10): #0 Change print item to: 

 print item,
 
 #1 Use print item, to make the print statement omit the newline. 

 In Python 3, it's print(item, end=" ") . 

 If you want every number to display in the same place, use for example (Python 2.7): 

 to = 20
digits = len(str(to - 1))
delete = "\b" * (digits + 1)
for i in range(to):
 print "{0}{1:{2}}".format(delete, i, digits),
 

 In Python 3, it's a bit more complicated; here you need to flush sys.stdout or it won't print anything until after the loop has finished: 

 import sys
to = 20
digits = len(str(to - 1))
delete = "\b" * (digits)
for i in range(to):
 print("{0}{1:{2}}".format(delete, i, digits), end="")
 sys.stdout.flush()

 You have to use terminal control codes for this, like so: 

 from sys import stdout
from time import sleep
for i in range(1,20):
 stdout.write("\r%d" % i)
 stdout.flush()
 sleep(1)
stdout.write("\r \r\n") # clean up
 

 The stdout.flush is necessary, or you won't get any output. You could replace the stdout.write with a print statement but I prefer not to mix print with direct use of file objects. 
 #3 You can add a trailing comma to your print statement to print a space instead of a newline in each iteration: 

 print item,
 

 Alternatively, if you're using Python 2.6 or later, you can use the new print function, which would allow you to specify that not even a space should come at the end of each item being printed (or allow you to specify whatever end you want): 

 from __future__ import print_function
...
print(item, end="")
 

 Finally, you can write directly to standard output by importing it from the sys module, which returns a file-like object: 

 from sys import stdout
...
stdout.write( str(item) )
 
 #4 Like the examples above, I use a similar approach but instead of spending time calculating out the last output length, etc, I simple use ansi code escapes to move back to the beginning of the line and then clear that entire line before printing my current status output. 

 import sys

class Printer():
 """
 Print things to stdout on one line dynamically
 """

 def __init__(self,data):

  sys.stdout.write("\r\x1b[K"+data.__str__())
  sys.stdout.flush()
 

 To use in your iteration loop you would just call something like: 

 x = 1
for f in fileList:
 ProcessFile(f)
 output = "File number %d completed." % x
 Printer(output)
 x += 1

 #5 In [9]: print?
Type:   builtin_function_or_method
Base Class:  &lt;type 'builtin_function_or_method'&gt;
String Form: &lt;built-in function print&gt;
Namespace:  Python builtin
Docstring:
 print(value, ..., sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout)

Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default.
Optional keyword arguments:
file: a file-like object (stream); defaults to the current sys.stdout.
sep: string inserted between values, default a space.
end: string appended after the last value, default a newline.
 
 #6 for i in xrange(1,100):
 print i,
 
 #7 To make the numbers overwrite each other, you can do something like this: 

 for i in range(1,100):
 print "\r",i,
 

 That should work as long as the number is printed in the first column. 

 EDIT:
Here's a version that will work even if it isn't printed in the first column. 

 prev_digits = -1
for i in range(0,1000):
 print("%s%d" % ("\b"*(prev_digits + 1), i)),
 prev_digits = len(str(i))
 

 I should note that this code was tested and works just fine in Python 2.5 on Windows, in the WIndows console. According to some others, flushing of stdout may be required to see the results. YMMV. 
 #8 "By the way...... How to refresh it every time so it print mi in one place just change the number." 

 It's really tricky topic. What zack suggested ( outputting console control codes ) is one way to achieve that. 

 You can use (n)curses, but that works mainly on *nixes. 

 On Windows (and here goes interesting part) which is rarely mentioned (I can't understand why) you can use Python bindings to WinAPI ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/ also with ActivePython by default) - it's not that hard and works well. Here's a small example: 

 import win32console, time

output_handle = win32console.GetStdHandle( win32console.STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE )
info = output_handle.GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo()
pos = info["CursorPosition"]

for i in "\\|/-\\|/-":
 output_handle.WriteConsoleOutputCharacter( i, pos )
 time.sleep( 1 )
 

 Or, if you want to use print (statement or function, no difference): 

 import win32console, time

output_handle = win32console.GetStdHandle( win32console.STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE )
info = output_handle.GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo()
pos = info["CursorPosition"]

for i in "\\|/-\\|/-":
 print i
 output_handle.SetConsoleCursorPosition( pos )
 time.sleep( 1 )
 

 win32console module enables you to do many more interesting things with windows console... I'm not a big fan of WinAPI, but recently I realized that at least half of my antipathy towards it was caused by writing WinAPI code in C - pythonic bindings are much easier to use. 

 All other answers are great and pythonic, of course, but... What if I wanted to print on previous line? Or write multiline text, than clear it and write the same lines again? My solution makes that possible. 
 #9 If you just want to print the numbers, you can avoid the loop. 

 # python 3
import time

startnumber = 1
endnumber = 100

# solution A without a for loop
start_time = time.clock()
m = map(str, range(startnumber, endnumber + 1))
print(' '.join(m))
end_time = time.clock()
timetaken = (end_time - start_time) * 1000
print('took {0}ms\n'.format(timetaken))

# solution B: with a for loop
start_time = time.clock()
for i in range(startnumber, endnumber + 1):
 print(i, end=' ')
end_time = time.clock()
timetaken = (end_time - start_time) * 1000
print('\ntook {0}ms\n'.format(timetaken))
