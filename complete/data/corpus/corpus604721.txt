Question (ID-604721): How would you translate this from Perl to Python? I've got a Perl function which takes a timestamp and returns either the unchanged timestamp (if it's never seen it before) or otherwise, it appends some letters to make it unique: 

 sub uniqify($) {
 my $timestamp = shift;

 state $last_ts = -1;
 state $next_letter = 'A';

 if ($timestamp == $last_ts) {
 $timestamp .= $next_letter++;
 } else {
 $last_ts = $timestamp;
 $next_letter = 'A';
 }

 return $timestamp;
}
 

 So if you call it four times, with the values 1, 1, 1, and 2, it will return 1, then 1A, then 1B, then 2. 

 Note: It only ever gets called with ever-increasing timestamps, so it doesn't need to recall every one it's ever seen, just the last one. 

 Now I need to translate this function to Python. I've learned that I can replace the "state" variables with globals (yuck!) or perhaps attach them to the function as attributes, but neither of those is particularly elegant. 

 Also, Python doesn't have something like Perl's magic autoincrement, where if you "++" a variable whose value is "A", it becomes "B" -- or if it's "Z", it becomes "AA". So that's a curveball too. 

 I'm hacking together a solution, but it's really ugly and hard to read. Translating from Perl to Python is supposed to have the opposite effect, right? :) So I'm offering this as a challenge to SO users. Can you make it an elegant Python function? 
 Answers (Total-8): #0 Look at this answer for a robust method to convert a number to an alphanumeric id 

 The code I present doesn't go from 'Z' to 'AA', instead goes to 'BA', but I suppose that doesn't matter, it still produces a unique id 

 from string import uppercase as up
import itertools

def to_base(q, alphabet):
 if q &lt; 0: raise ValueError( "must supply a positive integer" )
 l = len(alphabet)
 converted = []
 while q != 0:
  q, r = divmod(q, l)
  converted.insert(0, alphabet[r])
 return "".join(converted) or alphabet[0]

class TimestampUniqifier( object ):
 def __init__(self):
  self.last = ''
  self.counter = itertools.count()
 def __call__( self, str ):
  if str == self.last:
   suf = self.counter.next()
   return str + to_base( suf, up )
  else:
   self.last = str
   self.counter = itertools.count()
   return str   

timestamp_uniqify = TimestampUniqifier()
 

 usage: 

 timestamp_uniqify('1')
'1'
timestamp_uniqify('1')
'1A'
timestamp_uniqify('1')
'1B'
timestamp_uniqify('1')
'1C'
timestamp_uniqify('2')
'2'
timestamp_uniqify('3')
'3'
timestamp_uniqify('3')
'3A'
timestamp_uniqify('3')
'3B'
 

 You can call it maaaany times and it will still produce good results: 

 for i in range(100): print timestamp_uniqify('4')

 #1 Well, sorry to say, but you can't just do a direct translation from Perl to Python (including bit-for-bit Perlisms) and expect the outcome to be prettier. It won't be, it will be considerably uglier. 

 If you want the prettiness of Python you will need to use Python idioms instead. 

 Now for the question at hand: 

 from string import uppercase

class Uniquifier(object):

 def __init__(self):
  self.last_timestamp = None
  self.last_suffix = 0

 def uniquify(self, timestamp):
  if timestamp == self.last_timestamp:
   timestamp = '%s%s' % (timestamp,
         uppercase[self.last_suffix])
   self.last_suffix += 1
  else:
   self.last_suffix = 0
   self.timestamp = timestamp
  return timestamp

uniquifier = Uniquifier()
uniquifier.uniquify(a_timestamp)
 

 Prettier? Maybe. More readable? Probably. 

 Edit (re comments): Yes this fails after Z, and I am altogether unhappy with this solution. So I won't fix it, but might offer something better, like using a number instead: 

 timestamp = '%s%s' % (timestamp,
      self.last_suffix)
 

 If it were me, I would do this: 

 import uuid

def uniquify(timestamp):
 return '%s-%s' % (timestamp, uuid.uuid4())
 

 And just be happy. 
 #2 I just tested this up to 1000 against the original perl implementation and diff returns the same results for both. The suffix code is tricky -- this is not a base 36 counter. Hasen J's solution - though it produces a unique timestamp - isn't quite the same since it goes from 'Z' to 'BA', when it should instead go to 'AA' to match the perl ++ operator. 

 #!/usr/bin/python

class uniqify:
 def __init__(self):
  self.last_timestamp = -1
  self.next_suffix = 'A'
  return

 def suffix(self):
  s = self.next_suffix
  letters = [l for l in self.next_suffix]
  if letters[-1] == 'Z':
   letters.reverse()
   nonz = None
   for i in range(len(letters)):
    if letters[i] != 'Z':
     nonz = i
     break
   if nonz is not None:
    letters[nonz] = chr(ord(letters[nonz]) + 1)
    for i in range(0, nonz):
     letters[i] = 'A'
   else:
    letters = ['A'] * (len(letters) + 1)
   letters.reverse()
  else:
   letters[-1] = chr(ord(letters[-1]) + 1)

  self.next_suffix = ''.join(letters)
  return s

 def reset(self):
  self.next_suffix = 'A'
  return

 def __call__(self, timestamp):
  if timestamp == self.last_timestamp:
   timestamp_str = '%s%s' % (timestamp, self.suffix())
  else:
   self.last_timestamp = timestamp
   self.reset()
   timestamp_str = '%s' % timestamp

  return timestamp_str

uniqify = uniqify()

if __name__ == '__main__':
 for n in range(1000):
  print uniqify(1)
 for n in range(1000):
  print uniqify(2)
 
 #3 The class is generic and boring, but This is my very first recursive generator. &lt;3 

 def stamptag():
 yield ''
 prefixtag = stamptag()
 prefix = prefixtag.next()
 while True:
  for i in range(ord('A'),ord('Z')+1):
   yield prefix+chr(i)
  prefix = prefixtag.next()

tagger = stamptag()
for i in range(3000):
 tagger.next()
print tagger.next()

class uniquestamp:
 def __init__(self):
  self.timestamp = -1
  self.tagger = stamptag()

 def format(self,newstamp):
  if self.timestamp &lt; newstamp:
   self.tagger = stamptag()
   self.timestamp = newstamp
  return str(newstamp)+self.tagger.next()

stamper = uniquestamp()
print map(stamper.format, [1,1,1,2,2,3,4,4])
 

 output: 

 DKJ
['1', '1A', '1B', '2', '2A', '3', '4', '4A']
 
 #4 Quite similar to Ali A, but I'll post mine anyway: 

 class unique_timestamp:
 suffixes = " ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
 def __init__(self):
  self.previous_timestamps = {}
  pass
 def uniquify(self, timestamp):
  times_seen_before = self.previous_timestamps.get(timestamp, 0)
  self.previous_timestamps[timestamp] = times_seen_before + 1
  if times_seen_before &gt; 0:
   return str(timestamp) + self.suffixes[times_seen_before]
  else:
   return str(timestamp)
 

 Usage: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; u = unique_timestamp()
&gt;&gt;&gt; u.uniquify(1)
'1'
&gt;&gt;&gt; u.uniquify(1)
'1A'
&gt;&gt;&gt; u.uniquify(1)
'1B'
&gt;&gt;&gt; u.uniquify(2)
'2'
 
 #5 Does the suffix have to be letters like that? 

 from itertools import count
def unique(timestamp): 
 if timestamp in unique.ts.keys():
 return timestamp + '.' + str(unique.ts[timestamp].next())
 else:
 unique.ts[timestamp] = count()
 return timestamp
unique.ts = {}
 

 You can define a different count if you want the letters back. 

 This isn't the same as your perl code, though. 

 
 It keeps a dict around so if you have lots of unique timestamps then you'll use lots of memory. 
 It handles out of order calls, which the original doesn't (i.e. u(1), u(2), u(1)). 
 
 #6 This is my first time answering, and I used globals, but it seemed the simplest way to me. 

 from string import uppercase

last_ts = None
letters = None

def increment(letters):
 if not letters:
  return "A"
 last_letter = letters[-1]
 if last_letter == "Z":
  return increment(letters[:-1]) + "A" 
 return letters[:-1] + uppercase[uppercase.index(last_letter) + 1]

def uniquify(timestamp):
 global last_ts, letters
 if timestamp == last_ts:
  letters = increment(letters)
  return timestamp + letters
 last_ts = timestamp
 letters = None
 return timestamp

print uniquify("1")
print uniquify('1')
print uniquify("1")
print uniquify("2")
for each in range(100): print uniquify("2")

 #7 Looking at the problem it seems like a good fit for a coroutine (Python 2.5 or higher). Here's some code that will roughly produce the same result: 

 def uniqify():
 seen = {}
 val = (yield None)
 while True:
  if val in seen:
   idxa, idxb = seen[val]
   idxb += 1
  else:
   idxa, idxb = (len(seen)+1, ord('a'))
  seen[val] = (idxa, idxb)
  uniq = "%s%s" % (idxa, chr(idxb))
  val = (yield uniq)
 

 And here's how you use it: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; u = send.uniqify()
&gt;&gt;&gt; u.next() #need this to start the generator
&gt;&gt;&gt; u.send(1)
'1a'
&gt;&gt;&gt; u.send(1)
'1b'
&gt;&gt;&gt; u.send(1)
'1c'
&gt;&gt;&gt; u.send(2)
'2a'
&gt;&gt;&gt; u.send(2)
'2b'
&gt;&gt;&gt; u.send(1) #you can go back to previous values
'1d'
&gt;&gt;&gt; u.send('stringy') #you can send it anything that can be used as a dict key
'3a'
