Question (ID-4846359): Hide curly braces in C# After getting back into Python, I'm starting to notice and be annoyed more and more by my C# coding style requiring braces everywhere 

 if (...)
 {
  return ...;
 }
 else
 {
  return ...;
 }
 

 preferring the (subjective) much cleaner looking python counter-part 

 if ...:
 return ...
else
 return ...
 

 is there any way I can go about hiding these braces (as they do take up about 30% of my coding screen on average and just look ugly!) 
 Answers (Total-9): #0 Sorry, but if you're coding in C# and doing more than just simple single-expression blocks, you're going to have to suck it up. Python's "indent-denotes-scope" grammar may be nice, but it's Python, not C#. 
 #1 You could switch to: 

 if (...) {
  return ...;
 } else {
  return ...;
 }
 

 to gain some screen. 

 I think it's a bad idea to pretend that C# works like Python though. 
 #2 if (condition) {
 statement1
 statement2; }
else {
 statement3;
 statemen4; }
 

 much uglier in my opinion :( 
 #3 If you need .NET but like Python syntax, you might like to check Boo . 
 #4 Well, you can omit the braces in C#, so long as the if and else "blocks" are just single statements: 

 // perfectly legal
if (...)
 return ...
else
 return ...
 

 If you need multi-line if and else blocks then you're stuck with braces. 
 #5 
 You don't need the brackets if you have only one statement. For example, the following is working: 

 for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
 if (i == 9)
  break;
 
 

 (even though that code does not make any sense) 

 
 You can change the settings in Visual C# for formatting C# code as Skilldrick says, to make the code shorter: 
 

 Go to Tools -> Options -> Text Editor -> C# -> formatting (or something similar, I only have the german version of visual studio). 

 Hope that helps 
 #6 Check out scribes , its a really nice editor that is customizable to a large extent, and I'm quite sure that you can do what you needed with it. 
 #7 C/C++/Java/C# folks have an ages old racist kind of family feud with the Cobol/BASIC/Python clan. It's a real either/or thing... No best-of-the-both-world's, having-cakes-and-eating-them-too fun allowed :) 
 #8 For single statements you do not need the curly braces. For times you need them you might be OK with placing the braces like: 

 if(expr) {
 ...
} else {
 ...
}
