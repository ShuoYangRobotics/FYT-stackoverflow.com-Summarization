Question (ID-1657299): How do I read two lines from a file at a time using python I am coding a python script that parses a text file. The format of this text file is such that each element in the file uses two lines and for convenience I would like to read both lines before parsing. Can this be done in python? 

 I would like to some something like: 

 f = open(filename, "r")
for line in f:
 line1 = line
 line2 = f.readline()

f.close
 

 But this breaks saying that 

 ValueError: Mixing iteration and read methods would lose data
 

 Does anyone have any ideas? 

 Greatful for any help, 

 /Daniel

 What is the most “pythonic” way to iterate over a list in chunks? 
 
 Answers (Total-11): #0 Similar question here . You can't mix iteration and readline so you need to use one or the other. 

 while True:
 line1 = f.readline()
 line2 = f.readline()
 if not line2: break # EOF
 ...
 
 #1 import itertools
with open('a') as f:
 for line1,line2 in itertools.izip_longest(*[f]*2):
  print(line1,line2)
 

 izip_longest returns an iterator, so it should work well even if the file is very large. 

 If there are an odd number of lines, then line2 gets the value None on the last iteration. 

 izip_longest is in itertools if you have python 2.6 or later. If you use a prior version, you can pick up a python implementation of izip_longest here : 

 In the comments, it has been asked if this solution reads the whole file first, and then iterates over the file a second time.
I believe that it does not. The with open('a') as f line opens a file handle, but does not read the file. f is an iterator, so its contents are not read until requested. izip_longest takes iterators as arguments, and returns an iterator. 

 izip_longest is indeed fed the same iterator, f, twice. But what ends up happening is that f.next() (or next(f) in Python3) is called on the first argument and then on the second argument. Since next() is being called on the same underlying iterator, successive lines are yielded. This is very different than reading in the whole file. Indeed the purpose of using iterators is precisely to avoid reading in the whole file. 

 I therefore believe the solution works as desired -- the file is only read once by the for-loop. 

 To corroborate this, I ran the izip_longest solution versus a solution using f.readlines() . I put a raw_input() at the end to pause the scripts, and ran ps axuw on each: 

 % ps axuw | grep izip_longest_method.py
 

 unutbu 11119 2.2 0.2  4520 2712 pts/0 S+ 21:14 0:00 python /home/unutbu/pybin/izip_longest_method.py bigfile 

 % ps axuw | grep readlines_method.py
 

 unutbu 11317 6.5 8.8 93908 91680 pts/0 S+ 21:16 0:00 python /home/unutbu/pybin/readlines_method.py bigfile 

 The readlines clearly reads in the whole file at once. Since the izip_longest_method uses much less memory, I think it is safe to conclude it is not reading in the whole file at once. 
 #2 use line.next(), eg 

 f=open("file")
for line in f:
 print line
 nextline=f.next()
 print "next line", nextline
 ....
f.close()
 
 #3 I would proceed in a similar way as ghostdog74 , only with the try outside and a few modifications: 

 try:
 with open(filename) as f:
  for line1 in f:
   line2 = f.next()
   # process line1 and line2 here
except StopIteration:
 print "(End)" # do whatever you need to do with line1 alone
 

 This keeps the code simple and yet robust. Using the with closes the file if something else happens, or just closes the resources once you have exhausted it and exit the loop. 

 Note that with needs 2.6, or 2.5 with the with_statement feature enabled. 
 #4 Works for even and odd-length files. It just ignores the unmatched last line. 

 f=file("file")

lines = f.readlines()
for even, odd in zip(lines[0::2], lines[1::2]):
 print "even : ", even
 print "odd : ", odd
 print "end cycle"
f.close()
 

 If you have large files, this is not the correct approach. You are loading all the file in memory with readlines(). I once wrote a class that read the file saving the fseek position of each start of line. This allows you to get specific lines without having all the file in memory, and you can also go forward and backward. 

 I paste it here. License is Public domain, meaning, do what you want with it. Please note that this class has been written 6 years ago and I haven't touched or checked it since. I think it's not even file compliant. Caveat emptor . Also, note that this is overkill for your problem. I'm not claiming you should definitely go this way, but I had this code and I enjoy sharing it if you need more complex access.

 If you have an odd number of lines, it won't work perfectly, but this should give you a good outline. 
 #8 I have worked on a similar problem last month. I tried a while loop with f.readline() as well as f.readlines().
My data file is not huge, so I finally chose f.readlines(), which gives me more control of the index, otherwise
I have to use f.seek() to move back and forth the file pointer. 

 My case is more complicated than OP. Because my data file is more flexible on how many lines to be parsed each time, so
I have to check a few conditions before I can parse the data. 

 Another problem I found out about f.seek() is that it doesn't handle utf-8 very well when I use codecs.open('', 'r', 'utf-8'), (not exactly sure about the culprit, eventually I gave up this approach.)
