 Answers (Total-6): #0 Here you go 

 myString = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLM'
first = myString[3:7] # =&gt; DEFG
second = myString[8:11] # =&gt; IJK
 

 In the slicing syntax, the first number is inclusive and the second is excluded. 

 You can read more about String slicing from python docs 
 #1 Look into Python's concept called sequence slicing! 
 #2 a = "ABCDEFGHIJKLM"
print a[3:7], a[8:11]
 

 --> DEFG IJK 
 #3 s = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLM'
print s[3:7]
print s[8:11]
 
 #4 &gt;&gt;&gt; 'ABCDEFGHIJKLM'[3:7]
'DEFG'
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'ABCDEFGHIJKLM'[8:11]
'IJK'
 

 You might want to read a tutorial or beginners book. 
 #5 In alternative you can use operator.itemgetter: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; import operator
&gt;&gt;&gt; s = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLM'
&gt;&gt;&gt; f = operator.itemgetter(3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11)
&gt;&gt;&gt; f(s)
('D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K', 'L')
