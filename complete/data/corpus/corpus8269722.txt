Question (ID-8269722): how do i go over lines in an open text file on Python (2.72) i have a txt files with a few thousands of words in it (one word in a line).
iv'e written a function which take two words (strings), and checks if one
word is an Anagram of the other (that means if the two words contains the same
letters, even if in different order. 

 now i want to go over my huge txt file and search for Anagrams.
my output should be a list which contains touples of couple of words which
are Anagrams. 

 the problem is that i have no idea how to go over the words with a for/while loop.
everything iv'e tried failed. (i'm clear with the way of doing it, but i just don't know python well enough). 

 thanks for any help !

 edit#1:
assuming i want to go over lines 1 to 100 in the text instead of the whole text. how do i do that ? 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 file = 'file.txt'
with open(file, 'r') as f:
 for line in f:
  pass
 
 #1 The Python Tutorial has you covered: 

 
 An alternative approach to reading lines is to loop over the file
 object. This is memory efficient, fast, and leads to simpler code: 

 for line in f:
 print line,
 
 

 You can use itertools.combinations to get all combinations of words: 

 with open("file.txt") as word_list:
 for (word1, word2) in itertools.combinations(word_list, 2):
  if anagram(word1, word2):
   # do stuff
 
 #2 This one should show you how to do that: 

 http://docs.python.org/tutorial/inputoutput.html#methods-of-file-objects 
 #3 The readlines gets you a list of all the words in the file: 

 text = open("myfile.txt")
wordlist = text.readlines()
 

 Now you just have to do the for loop: 

 for item in wordlist:
 anagramfunction()...
 
 #4 
 load all words (lines) into list, while words are in separate lines this can be done via readlines() (you will have to use strip() to remove line ends): 

 words = [s.strip() for s in f.readlines()] 
 for each word create anagram 
 use word list in operator for that anagram to check if anagram exists 
 if exists then print 
 
 #5 I assume your list of words is not so huge it does not fit in RAM. Here is a (non-optimized) algorithm that would build the list of anagrams (using bits of previous answers): 

 def buildAnagramsList(word, wordList):
 anagramsList = []
 for word2 in wordList:
  if areAnagrams(word, word2): #you already have a similar method
   list.remove(word2) # Spare some time here by not looking twice for the same anagrams
   anagramsList.append(word2)
 return anagramsList

file = open("myfile.txt")
words = [s.strip() for s in file.readlines()]
anagramsLists = [buildAnagramsList(word, words) for word in words]
 
 #6 I would have gone for something like this: 

 wordList = []
anagrams = []

file = StringIO.StringIO(open("file.txt","rb"),dialect=csv.excel) //Using csv.excel as each word is on a different line, so hoping this should work but Im not entirely sure
wordList.extend(wordList)
 

 Wordlist should now be something like [Word1, Word2, Word3] 

 for i in xrange(wordList):
 if wordList[i] == wordList[i+1]://Code to analyse anagrams here
  anagrams.append(wordList[i])
 

 Im really not sure on this syntax, Im giving you an idea of what I would do. Although someone will probably down-vote this answer as its off the top of my head and you would have to stop it throwing an OutOfBounds error but I didnt have a lot of time to write it! :P
