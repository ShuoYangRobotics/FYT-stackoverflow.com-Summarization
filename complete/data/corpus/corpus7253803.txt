Question (ID-7253803): how to get everything after last slash in a URL? How can I extract whatever follows the last slash in a URL in python? For example, these URLs should return the following: 

 URL: http://www.test.com/TEST1
returns: TEST1

URL: http://www.test.com/page/TEST2
returns: TEST2

URL: http://www.test.com/page/page/12345
returns: 12345
 

 I've tried urlparse, but that gives me the full path filename, such as page/page/12345. 

 thx 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 You don't need fancy things, just see the string methods in the standard library : 

 url.rsplit('/',1)
 
 #1 You can use os.path.basename(): 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; from os.path import basename
&gt;&gt;&gt; basename('http://www.test.com/TEST1')
'TEST1'
 

 EDIT:
You better use Luke404's solution: 

 url.rsplit('/',1)
 
 #2  rsplit should be up to the task: 

 In [1]: 'http://www.test.com/page/TEST2'.rsplit('/', 1)[1]
Out[1]: 'TEST2'
 
 #3 extracted_url = url[url.rfind("/")+1:];
 
 #4 One more (idio(ma)tic) way: 

 URL.split("/")[-1]
 
 #5 partition and rpartition are also handy for such things: 

 url.rpartition('/')[2]
