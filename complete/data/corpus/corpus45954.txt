Question (ID-45954): Python libdwarf module I'm working on a utility which needs to resolve hex addresses to a symbolic function name and source code line number within a binary. The utility will run on Linux on x86, though the binaries it analyzes will be for a MIPS-based embedded system. The MIPS binaries are in ELF format, using DWARF for the symbolic debugging information. 

 I'm currently planning to fork objdump, passing in a list of hex addresses and parsing the output to get function names and source line numbers. I have compiled an objdump with support for MIPS binaries, and it is working. 

 I'd prefer to have a package allowing me to look things up natively from the Python code without forking another process. I can find no mention of libdwarf, libelf, or libbfd on python.org, nor any mention of python on dwarfstd.org. 

 Is there a suitable module available somewhere? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 You might be interested in the DWARF library from pydevtools : 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; from devtools.dwarf import DWARF
&gt;&gt;&gt; dwarf = DWARF('test/test')
&gt;&gt;&gt; dwarf.get_loc_by_addr(0x8048475)
('/home/emilmont/Workspace/dbg/test/main.c', 36, 0)
 
 #1 You should give Construct a try. It is very useful to parse binary data into python objects. 

 There is even an example for the ELF32 file format. 
 #2 I don't know of any, but if all else fails you could use ctypes to directly use libdwarf, libelf or libbfd. 
 #3 I've been developing a DWARF parser using Construct . Currently fairly rough, and parsing is slow. But I thought I should at least let you know. It may suit your needs, with a bit of work. 

 I've got the code in Mercurial, hosted at bitbucket:

 http://bitbucket.org/cmcqueen1975/construct/ (necessary modifications to Construct library) 
 

 Construct is a very interesting library. DWARF is a complex format (as I'm discovering) and pushes Construct to its limits I think. 
 #4 hachior is another library for parsing binary data 
 #5 Please check pyelftools - a new pure Python library meant to do this.
