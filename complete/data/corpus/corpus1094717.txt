Question (ID-1094717): Convert a string to integer with decimal in Python I have a string in the format: 'nn.nnnnn' in Python, and I'd like to convert it to an integer. 

 Direct conversion fails: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; s = '23.45678'
&gt;&gt;&gt; i = int(s)
Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '23.45678'
 

 I can convert it to a decimal by using: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; from decimal import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; d = Decimal(s)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print d
23.45678
 

 I could also split on '.', then subtract the decimal from zero, then add that to the whole number ... yuck. 

 But I'd prefer to have it as an int, without unnecessary type conversions or maneuvering. 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 How about this? 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; s = '23.45678'
&gt;&gt;&gt; int(float(s))
23
 

 Or... 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; int(Decimal(s))
23
 

 Or... 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; int(s.split('.')[0])
23
 

 I doubt it's going to get much simpler than that, I'm afraid. Just accept it and move on. 
 #1 What sort of rounding behavior do you want? Do you 2.67 to turn into 3, or 2. If you want to use rounding, try this: 

 s = '234.67'
i = int(round(float(s)))
 

 Otherwise, just do: 

 s = '234.67'
i = int(float(s))
 
 #2 "Convert" only makes sense when you change from one data type to another without loss of fidelity. The number represented by the string is a float and will lose precision upon being forced into an int. 

 You want to round instead, probably (I hope that the numbers don't represent currency because then rounding gets a whole lot more complicated). 

 round(float('23.45678'))
 
 #3 You could use: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; s = '23.245678'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; i = int(float(s))
 
 #4 &gt;&gt;&gt; s = '23.45678'
&gt;&gt;&gt; int(float(s))
23
&gt;&gt;&gt; int(round(float(s)))
23
&gt;&gt;&gt; s = '23.54678'
&gt;&gt;&gt; int(float(s))
23
&gt;&gt;&gt; int(round(float(s)))
24
 

 You don't specify if you want rounding or not... 
 #5 round(float("123.789"))
 

 will give you an integer value, but a float type. With Python's duck typing, however, the actual type is usually not very relevant. This will also round the value, which you might not want. Replace 'round' with 'int' and you'll have it just truncated and an actual int. Like this: 

 int(float("123.789"))
 

 But, again, actual 'type' is usually not that important. 
 #6 The expression int(float(s)) mentioned by others is the best if you want to truncate the value. If you want rounding, using int(round(float(s)) if the round algorithm matches what you want (see the round documentation ), otherwise you should use Decimal and one if its rounding algorithms.
