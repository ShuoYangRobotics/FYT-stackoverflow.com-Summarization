Question (ID-1096396): What is the easiest way to handle dates/times in Python? My use case is that I'm just making a website that I want people all over the world to be able to use, and I want to be able to say things like "This happened at 5:33pm on October 5" and also "This happened 5 minutes ago," etc. 

 Should I use the datetime module? 
Or just strftime?
Or something fancier that isn't part of the std distro of Python? 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 Take a look at the dateutil module:

 It's good at doing the types of things you're looking for - see some of the examples in the documentation. 
 #1 You may have a look at Django's humanize module . 
It is part of Django, but I think it would be quite easy to adapt it to your needs. 
 #2 If you're going to use datetime , make sure you read this recent and most excellent article:
 Tips on using python's datetime module . datetime will take care of most of the niceties of handling time arithmetic, but it won't give you the English-language pretty printing you're looking for. 
 #3 The datetime module in Python will allow you to get/set/manipulate dates and times. 
A question about relative date formatting in Python has already been asked: Stack Overflow Post 
but with very little responce. 
 #4 Try relativeDates Module module. It exactly brings you the stuff you wanted. 
 #5 I have always been very happy using the datetime package. You get a lot of stuff for free, and it's pretty easy to create datetime objects as well, calculate duration ect. 
 #6 There is also the Time module .
