Question (ID-4634935): Game engine with python scripting? Looking to put together a 3D side-scrolling action platformer. Since this is my first time trying to put together a non-simple adventure game, I'm at a loss for which engine to consider. 

 I would prefer one that supports scripting in python, since that's my primary language. Without tight controls, the game will suck... so speed is a priority. Cross-platform is also important to me. 

 Any suggestions? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 try pygame and pyopengl together, here are some examples: http://www.pygame.org/gamelets/#NEHE you also may use blender engine: http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Dev:Contents#Python 
 #1 Pyglet is another one.

 See Differences between Python game libraries Pygame and Pyglet? 
 #2 This is what I would use: Unity . It has a learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, it's very powerful. It uses your choice of Java, Boo(which I hear is very similar to Python), and C#. 

 Regardless of what you pick, I would advise you learn Java. It's a widespread language, so it should open up lots of options for you in various ventures. Learning another language is always very good for you. 
 #3 Panda3D:

 It's a 3D game engine written in C++ but specifically designed for use in Python. Disney has used it for some of its games in the past, including 2 MMOs. There is support for shaders, etc., and is BSD licensed. Windows, Mac, and Linux are all supported, and there appears to be a browser plugin. I haven't used it personally, though. 
 #4 PyOgre is the Python bindings of the C++ graphics engine Ogre. 
 #5 You got more choices. I am collecting them in a list since a few years ago: http://codeboje.de/2d-and-3d-game-and-rendering-engines-python/ 

 To name some: 

 
 Python-Ogre 
 Panda3D 
 Blender Game Engine 
 Delta3D 
 PySoy
