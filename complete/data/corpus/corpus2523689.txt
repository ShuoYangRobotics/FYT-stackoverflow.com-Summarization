Question (ID-2523689): Easiest ways to generate graphs from Python? I'm using Python to process CSV files filled with data that I want to run calculations on, and then graph. I'm looking for a library to use that I can send processed CSV information to, or a dict of some sort, and then choose different graphing styles with. 

 Does anyone have any recommendations? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 I'm personally using matplotlib and am very happy with it. 
 #1 Matplotlib and Gnuplot.py are popular choices. I've used both. 
 #2 I've been using matplotlib for about 3 years now to plot experimental data. Before I was using Excel and that was just a pain. I've been happy with matplotlib ever since. It's great and very powerful. 
 #3 For client-side charts Open Flash Chart or Google Charts Tools . 
 #4 There is pychart or PyCha , both of which I have not used but have been considering myself. 
 #5 It depends on the kind of graph you want,
most of the time, i'm using matplotlib but sometimes pydot is good.
The various layout algorithms are good for me when dealing with huge graphs
