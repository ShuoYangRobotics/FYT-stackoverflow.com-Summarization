Question (ID-6295296): Beginner Python question I am starting to learn python. I have gone through several tutorials and now I am trying to write my first script. It is a simple console menu. I am running Python 2.6.5 under cygwin. 

 Here is my script: 

 import sys

print "********************************************************************"
print "** 1) This is menu choice #1          **"
print "**                **"
print "**                **"
print "**                **"
print "**                **"
print "**                **"
print "********************************************************************"
print
print "Choice ?"

choice = sys.stdin.readline()

print "You entered: " + choice

if choice == 1:
 choice1 = sys.stdin.readline()
 print "You entered:" + choice1
else:
 quit()

print "Exiting"
 

 When I run the script, I get to the Choice? prompt. I enter 1 and I get the "You entered:" message and then the script exits without displaying the "Exiting" message. 

 Seems like it should be so easy. Thanks in advance for any help. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 You're comparing a string to an integer. Try converting the string into an integer: 

 if int(choice.strip()) == 1:
 
 #1 
 Use raw_input() instead of sys.stdin.readline() 
 Change choice == 1 to choice == '1' 
 
 #2 The problem is that readline returns a string, but your if statement expects an int . To convert the string to an int , you could use int(choice.strip()) (be prepared for it to raise an exception if what you enter isn't a valid number). 

 In [8]: choice
Out[8]: '1\n'

In [9]: int(choice.strip())
Out[9]: 1
 
 #3 Not sure, but I think the user is entering a string, not a number. The number 1 and the string 1 are two completely different things. 

 Try choice == "1" 
 #4 The readline function retains the newline at the end of the input. Your first if should be: 

 if choice == "1\n":
 

 assuming you want the newline. 
 #5 It's exiting by calling quit() since it takes the else branch. That's because '1' (a string) does not equal 1 , an integer.
