Question (ID-4034169): How can I use HTML + Javascript to build a python GUI? I have been experimenting with Appcelerator Titanum yesterday and I think it's cool when it comes to Javascript. 

 Python features on Appcelerator Titanum are so limited (can't use some modules for example). 

 My question is How can I use html &amp; javascript as a GUI tool for a real python application ? 

 I am running windows 7 and i was thinking of using webkit for that purpose but couldn't know how to work with it in python. 

 I am planning to make a standalone executable using py2exe as I don't know if the users always have python and the appropriate modules installed.

 You run a web server on your desktop. For example, this: http://docs.python.org/library/simplehttpserver.html In a few lines of code you can provide a complete HTTP server that will serve your HTML and Javascript to a browser.

 Hard to parse that. It either indicates too much coffee or no familiarity with punctuation. 

 Randomly, I'll pick the following words as possibly being meaningful.

 You run a web server on your desktop. The web server provides html and javascript pages to a browser -- also running on your desktop. 
 #1 If you're after webkit bindings for Python, look at PyQt, which includes Webkit, as well as wxWebkit ( http://wxwebkit.wxcommunity.com/ ) if you're using wxWidgets. This lets you embed webkit in a Qt or Wxwidgets app so that you won't have to go through a browser. 

 If you do use this, then you can either use a web server in Python, like others have mentioned, or you can control the Webkit control directly (though I'm not sure how practical this is). 

 Beyond that, there's also Pyjamas Desktop ( http://pyjs.org/ ), which lets you use Pyjamas to build the application, then run it. 
 #2 pywebkitgtk might be what you are looking for.

 But I'm not sure if it runs on Windows. 

 PyQt and Webkit would work on Windows.

 But really. If you want to make a desktop application you are better of with just PyQt ;) 
 #3 Here is a nice PyCon talk on the subject. 
 #4 Have you looked at htmlayout? http://terrainformatica.com/htmlayout/main.whtm 
 #5 I assume you are mobilizing a web-application for cross platform access. 

 If so have you considered abstracting the cross platform access at the web-app presentation layer ? 

 Appcelerator / Webkit does not provide true native look-and-feel on mobile devices but this is where a new technology can help.
