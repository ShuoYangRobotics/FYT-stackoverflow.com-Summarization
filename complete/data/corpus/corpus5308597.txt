Question (ID-5308597): Good programming guide for a middleschooler I hope that this forum is the right place to ask this question! 

 I am a teacher at a combined middle/high school and one of the eighth graders is interested in teaching himself some programming. 

 I've recommended Python as an introductory language. I have struggled to find any programming guides, however, that are accessible (from a language and tone perspective) to an eighth grader. 

 Are there any guides that you can recommend?

 It is free and aimed at beginner programmers. In my opinion - the best choice for your students. 
 #1 I think Python is an excellent choice for students who are completely new to programming. 

 The Livewires tutorials are written specifically for middle schoolers. 

 And C would be the last language I would start anyone on. 
 #2 Does he have any interest in games? There's Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python . 
 #3 Learn Python the Hard Way is (ironically) very accessible and beginner-friendly. 'Hard Way' in this case refers to huge amounts of typing, which is a great way to learn.

 #5 i started with C at university without any knowledge of programming or whatever, i am sure he is better than the times i was a freshman. 

 but the important point of programming is not the language for the beginning, it is the understanding of solving a problem 

 teach him writing an algorithm then suggest C/Python whatever he can find his own path after learning about algorithms 
 #6 DiveIntoPython3 is a good resource; it does a good job of providing background info as it introduces new topics. There's also DiveIntoPython which refers to Python 2. 

 EDIT: After perusing some other Q&amp;A on the site, I've found some users who recommend DIP/DIP3 and some who do not, so YMMV. 

 However, that brings up the point that Stack Overflow itself is a good way to find specific resources. Below I list a two questions that should help you to find Python resources (most answers specify beginner/intermediate/expert). Hope it helps.
