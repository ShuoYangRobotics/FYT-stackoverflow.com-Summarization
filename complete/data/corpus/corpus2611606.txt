Question (ID-2611606): Geometry library for python (or C++) for CAD-like operations? I'm trying to put together a simple program that will let me visualize a series of consecutive cuts on a wood panel using a router with a particular cutting head. I'm trying to find a decent geometry library that will give me a shortcut through the CAD-like stuff. 

 Specifically, I'd like to be able to define a rectangular solid (the wood panel) and then define a bit profile shape, and take cuts through the rectangular solid (sometimes on a straight line, sometimes on a circular arc). Does anyone know of anything that will do this? 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 pythonOCC is an interesting option too! 
 #1 Maybe FreeCAD 's Python level can supply what you're requesting. 
 #2 Going the C++ way, if you have Direct3D/OpenGL experience, you could muck around with TetGen and GTS to put something together. 

 WARNING: Very Long learning curve. 

 UPDATE: I have experimenting with Carve CSG recently and am happy with the results so far. You could easily subtract the cut from the wood panel to get the results you want. 
 #3 HeeksCAD might do the job for you. http://code.google.com/p/heekscad/

 #6 We are using sgCore 

 Very powerful and simple library.
