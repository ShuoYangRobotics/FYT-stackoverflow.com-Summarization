Question (ID-1779286): Swapping 1 with 0 and 0 with 1 in a pythonic way? In some part of my Python program I have a val variable that can be 1 or 0. If it's 1 I must change to 0, if it's 0 I must change to 1. 

 How do you do it in a Pythonic way? 

 if val == 1:
 val = 0
elif val == 0:
 val = 1
 

 it's too long! 

 I did: 

 swap = {0: 1, 1:0}
 

 So I can use it: 

 swap[val]
 

 Other ideas? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 This isn't pythonic, but it is language neutral. Often val = 1 - val is simplest. 
 #1 Since True == 1 and False == 0 in python, 

 you could just use var = not var 

 It will just swap it. 
 #2 Just another possibility: 

 i = (1,0)[i]
 

 This works well as long as i is positive, as dbr pointed out in the comments it doesn't work fail for i &lt; 0. 

 Are you sure you don't want to use False and True ? It sounds almost like it. 
 #3 The shortest is the bitwise operator XOR: 

 val ^= 1
 
 #4 In your case I recommend the ternary: 

 val = 0 if val else 1
 

 If you had 2 variables to swap you could say: 

 (a, b) = (b, a)
 
 #5 If you want to be short: 

 f = lambda val: 0 if val else 1
 

 Then: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; f(0)
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; f(1)
0
