Question (ID-1322787): What would be the best way to use python's functions from excel? Somebody really needs to fix this "subjective questions evaluator" 

 I usually compile my functions in a DLL and call them from excel. That works fine (well, let's just say it works) 

 Unfortunatelly, python cannot be compiled. I know of py2exe but I don't know that it can make a DLL. 

 So, ..., is there any other way ? I appreciate all ideas and suggestions on the matter. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 One way is to write a COM server in Python, and call that from Excel. There are tutorials describing Win32 COM servers , and screencasts on calling such servers from Excel . 
 #1 This is probably not a possible solution for you, but there is the Resolver One spreadsheet application (which is like Excel combined with Python). It is not connected with Excel in any way, but claims to be compatible to some extent. 
 #2 Im surprised nobody mentioned pyxll . From the website: 

 
 PyXLL is an Excel addin that enables functions written in Python to be
 called in Excel. Python functions can either be exposed as Excel user
 defined functions that can be called from worksheets, as custom menu
 items, or as macros. 
 
 #3 I don't know any py2dll similar to py2exe. 

 However, you could create a dll in C and use the Very High Level Layer to call your script. I don't know it is an acceptable solution for you. Just an idea. 
 #4 I had to do this some years back. My solution was to run small Python server that exported the functions using SOAP, then call the functions using Visual Basic's SOAP library. The advantage is that you don't have to ship a Python environment with your spreadsheets. The disadvantage is that the clients will need a network connection. 
 #5 There is an Excel Addin that allows you to do this called Discovery Script at xefion.com. 

 It's free but not open source. It's also based on the IronPython implementation.
