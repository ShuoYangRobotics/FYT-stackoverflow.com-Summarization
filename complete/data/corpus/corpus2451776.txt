Question (ID-2451776): working with negative numbers in python Thank you for your help in advance. I am a student in a concepts of programming class. The lab is run by a TA and today in lab he gave us a real simple little program to build. It was one where it would multiply by addition. Anyway, he had us use absolute to avoid breaking the prog with negatives. I whipped it up real quick and then argued with him for 10 minutes that it was bad math. It was, 4 * -5 does not equal 20, it equals -20. He said that he really dosen't care about that and that it would be too hard to make the prog handle the negatives anyway. So my question is how do I go about this. 

 here is the prog I turned in: 

 #get user input of numbers as variables

numa, numb = input("please give 2 numbers to multiply seperated with a comma:")

#standing variables
total = 0
count = 0

#output the total
while (count&lt; abs(numb)):
 total = total + numa
 count = count + 1

#testing statements
if (numa, numb &lt;= 0):
 print abs(total)
else:
 print total
 

 I want to do it without absolutes, but every time I input negative numbers I get a big fat goosegg. I know there is some simple way to do it, I just can't find it. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Too hard? Your TA is... well, the phrase would probably get me banned. Anyways, check to see if numb is negative. If it is then multiply numa by -1 and do numb = abs(numb) . Then do the loop. 
 #1 The abs() in the while condition is needed, since, well, it controls the number of iterations (how would you define a negative number of iterations?). You can correct it by inverting the sign of the result if numb is negative. 

 So this is the modified version of your code. Note I replaced the while loop with a cleaner for loop. 

 #get user input of numbers as variables
numa, numb = input("please give 2 numbers to multiply seperated with a comma:")

#standing variables
total = 0

#output the total
for count in range(abs(numb)):
 total += numa

if numb &lt; 0:
 total = -total

print total
 
 #2 Perhaps you would accomplish this with something to the effect of 

 text = raw_input("please give 2 numbers to multiply separated with a comma:")
split_text = text.split(',')
a = int(split_text[0])
b = int(split_text[1])
# The last three lines could be written: a, b = map(int, text.split(','))
# but you may find the code I used a bit easier to understand for now.

if b &gt; 0:
 num_times = b
else:
 num_times = -b

total = 0
# While loops with counters basically should not be used, so I replaced the loop 
# with a for loop. Using a while loop at all is rare.
for i in xrange(num_times):
 total += a 
 # We do this a times, giving us total == a * abs(b)

if b &lt; 0:
 # If b is negative, adjust the total to reflect this.
 total = -total

print total
 

 or maybe 

 a * b
 
 #3 Try this on your TA: 

 # Simulate multiplying two N-bit two's-complement numbers
# into a 2N-bit accumulator
# Use shift-add so that it's O(base_2_log(N)) not O(N)

for numa, numb in ((3, 5), (-3, 5), (3, -5), (-3, -5), (-127, -127)):
 print numa, numb,
 accum = 0
 negate = False
 if numa &lt; 0:
  negate = True
  numa = -numa
 while numa:
  if numa &amp; 1:
   accum += numb
  numa &gt;&gt;= 1
  numb &lt;&lt;= 1
 if negate:
  accum = -accum
 print accum
 

 output: 

 3 5 15
-3 5 -15
3 -5 -15
-3 -5 15
-127 -127 16129
 
 #4 How about something like that? (Uses no abs() nor mulitiplication) 
Notes: 

 
 the abs() function is only used for the optimization trick. This snippet can either be removed or recoded. 
 the logic is less efficient since we're testing the sign of a and b with each iteration (price to pay to avoid both abs() and multiplication operator) 
 

 

 def multiply_by_addition(a, b):
""" School exercise: multiplies integers a and b, by successive additions.
"""
 if abs(a) &gt; abs(b):
  a, b = b, a  # optimize by reducing number of iterations
 total = 0
 while a != 0:
  if a &gt; 0:
   a -= 1
   total += b
  else:
   a += 1
   total -= b
 return total

multiply_by_addition(2,3)
6
multiply_by_addition(4,3)
12
multiply_by_addition(-4,3)
-12
multiply_by_addition(4,-3)
-12
multiply_by_addition(-4,-3)
12
 
 #5 Thanks everyone, you all helped me learn a lot. This is what I came up with using some of your suggestions 

 #this is apparently a better way of getting multiple inputs at the same time than the 
#way I was doing it
text = raw_input("please give 2 numbers to multiply separated with a comma:")
split_text = text.split(',')
numa = int(split_text[0])
numb = int(split_text[1])

#standing variables
total = 0

if numb &gt; 0:
 repeat = numb
else:
 repeat = -numb

#for loops work better than while loops and are cheaper
#output the total
for count in range(repeat):
 total += numa


#check to make sure the output is accurate
if numb &lt; 0:
 total = -total


print total
 

 Thanks for all the help everyone.
