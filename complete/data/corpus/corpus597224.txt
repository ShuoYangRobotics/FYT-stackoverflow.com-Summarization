Question (ID-597224): looking for a working linux command line tool to download from rapidshare I'm wondering if anyone knows about a working command line tool for linux to download using premium account on rapidshare. I've seen a python solution , which does not work for me -- returns urllib2 error message 

 urlopen error unknown url type: https
 

 and my knowledge of python is not yet deep enough to figure out why: might be a recent RS change or something is wrong with my settings. 

 Any other tools around someone may be using and could share a link? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0  curl is a remarkably powerful command-line tool for squeezing things out of web servers. I can't say about RapidShare in particular, but if you see what the manual download is doing, you can get curl to post the same forms, for example. 
 #1  wget works well. You have to point it to a file containing the cookie corresponding to your Rapidshare account (e.g. the cookies.txt in Firefox's profile directory). 

 wget --load-cookies /path/to/cookies.txt http://...
 
 #2 Here's a tutorial for a command line tool to download from rapidshare:

 #3 I like Plowshare . 
It let's you (depending on file hosting) 

 
 download 
 upload 
 list 
 delete 
 
 #4 To get urllib2 to open https URLs you need Python with SSL support. How to get it depends on your distribution. 
 #5 Nice commandline tool for RapidShare and many other services (MegaUploads, HotFiles etc). It allows simultanous transfer from different services: 

 http://svn.pld-linux.org/cgi-bin/viewsvn/toys/rsget.pl/ 

 Just create file with list of URLs (# for comment), and start rsget.pl list-of-urls
It monitors file with url list, so you can add/remove links without restarting script (i.e. breaking current transfer).
