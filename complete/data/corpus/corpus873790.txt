Question (ID-873790): Print space after each word what is an easy/effective way to combine an array of words together with a space in between, but no space before or after? 

 I suppose it is possible to remove the space after combining everything in a loop (something like sum += (term + " "))...I don't like it though. 

 Preferably code in Java, Python, or Ruby. 

 Thanks! 
 Answers (Total-10): #0 Well, in Python it will be straightforward using join : 

 values = ["this", "is", "your", "array"]
result = " ".join(values)
 
 #1 Yes, this is what join was made for. Here is the Ruby version: 

 ["word", "another", "word"].join(" ")
 

 &lt;flamebait&gt; As you can see, Ruby makes join a method on Array instead of String , and is thus far more sensible. &lt;/flamebait&gt; 
 #2 What you want is String.Join, but since just saying that probably won't help you, here are some Join implementations in Java . Here's a string utility that has a join for Java. 
 #3 Straight from one of my existing utilz classes 

 C:\java\home\src\krc\utilz\Arrayz.java 

 package krc.utilz;

/**
 * A bunch of static helper methods for arrays of String's.
 * @See also krc.utilz.IntArrays for arrays of int's.
 */
public abstract class Arrayz
{
 /**
 * Concetenates the values in the given array into a string, seperated by FS.
 * @param FS String - Field Seperator - Name borrowed from awk
 * @param Object[] a - array to be concatentated
 * @return a string representation of the given array.
 */
 public static String join(String FS, Object[] a) {
 if (a==null||a.length==0) return "";
 StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder(String.valueOf(a[0]));
 for(int i=1; i&lt;a.length; i++) {
  result.append(FS);
  result.append(String.valueOf(a[i]));
 }
 return result.toString();
 }

 ....

}

 EDIT 

 Here's a quick &amp; dirty performance comparison, using java.util.Arrays as a baseline. 

 Note that hotspot cost is amortized over 100 iterations, and should be (more or less) the same for all three techniques... krc.utilz.RandomString and krc.utilz.Arrayz are both available upon request, just ask. 

 package forums;

import java.util.Arrays;
import krc.utilz.Arrayz;
import krc.utilz.RandomString;

class ArrayToStringPerformanceTest
{
 private static final int NS2MS = 1000000; // 1 millisecond (1/10^3) = 1,000,000 nanoseconds (1/10^9)

 public static void main(String[] args) {
 try {
  String[] array = randomStrings(100*1000, 16);
  long start, stop;
  String result;

  final int TIMES = 100;
  long time1=0L, time2=0L, time3=0L;

  for (int i=0; i&lt;TIMES; i++) {

  start = System.nanoTime();
  result = Arrays.toString(array);
  stop = System.nanoTime();
  //System.out.println("Arrays.toString took "+(stop-start)+" ns");
  time1 += (stop-start);

  start = System.nanoTime();
  result = Arrayz.join(", ", array);
  stop = System.nanoTime();
  //System.out.println("Arrayz.join  took "+(stop-start)+" ns");
  time2 += (stop-start);

  start = System.nanoTime();
  result = arrayToString(array, ", ");
  stop = System.nanoTime();
  //System.out.println("arrayToString took "+(stop-start)+" ns");
  time3 += (stop-start);

  }
  System.out.format("java.util.Arrays.toString took "+(time1/TIMES/NS2MS)+" ms");
  System.out.format("krc.utilz.Arrayz.join  took "+(time2/TIMES/NS2MS)+" ms");
  System.out.format("arrayToString    took "+(time3/TIMES/NS2MS)+" ms");

 } catch (Exception e) {
  e.printStackTrace();
 }
 }

 public static String arrayToString(String[] array, String spacer) {
 StringBuffer result = new StringBuffer();
 for ( int i=0; i&lt;array.length; i++ ) {
  result.append( array[i] + ((i+1&lt;array.length)?spacer:"") );
 }
 return result.toString();
 }

 private static String[] randomStrings(int howMany, int length) {
 RandomString random = new RandomString();
 String[] a = new String[howMany];
 for ( int i=0; i&lt;howMany; i++) {
  a[i] = random.nextString(length);
 }
 return a;
 }

}

 #4 Java could be accomplished with something like this: 

 public static String arrayToString(String[] array, String spacer) {
	StringBuffer result = new StringBuffer();
	for(int i = 0 ; i &lt; array.length ; i++) {
		result.append(array[i] + ((i + 1 &lt; array.length) ? spacer : ""));
	}
	return result.toString();
}
 
 #5 This will work in Ruby as well: 

 ['a', 'list', 'of', 'words'] * " "
 
 #6 Eric Lippert had a great post about this problem a few weeks back. 
 #7 Well, I know Python has a function like this, and I'm assuming Ruby does, and Java. 

 The join function takes an array of strings (depending on the language, it can be other types) and joins them together with a character (or another string) that you choose. 

 Python code: 

 wordString = " ".join(["word", "another", "word"])
 

 Otherwise, you can loop through, the array, adding the word and a space, and test if it is the last element. If it is, just add the word, and not the space. 

 Python code again: (thanks to PTBNL for the suggestion) 

 wordArray = ["word", "another", "word"]
wordString = ""
for i in range(0, len(wordArray) - 1):
 wordString += wordArray[i] + " "
wordString += wordArray[len(wordArray) - 1]
 
 #8 In Python, you ask the join string to join an iterable of strings: 

 alist= ["array", "of", "strings"]
output= " ".join(alist)
 

 If this notation seems weird to you, you can do the same thing in a different syntax: 

 output= str.join(" ", alist)
 

 This works for any iterable (lists, tuples, dictionaries, generators, generator expressionsâ€¦), as long as the items are all strings (or unicode strings). 

 You can substitute unicode for str (or u' ' for ' ' ) if you want a unicode result. 
 #9 Let's not forget the good old-fashioned 

 for s in strArray do
  print s
  print " "
