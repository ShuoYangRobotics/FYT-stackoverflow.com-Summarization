Question (ID-1688863): Deleting from dict if found in new list in Python Say I have a dictionary with whatever number of values.
And then I create a list.
If any of the values of the list are found in the dictionary, regardless of whether or not it is a key or an index how do I delete the full value? 

 E.g: 

 dictionary = {1:3,4:5}
list = [1]
...
 dictionary = {4:5}
 

 How do I do this without creating a new dictionary? 
 Answers (Total-8): #0 for key, value in list(dic.items()):
 if key in lst or value in lst:
  del dic[key]
 

 No need to create a separate list or dictionary. 

 I interpreted "whether or not it is a key or an index" to mean "whether or not it is a key or a value [in the dictionary]" 
 #1 it's a bit complicated because of your "values" requirement: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; dic = {1: 3, 4: 5}
&gt;&gt;&gt; ls = set([1])
&gt;&gt;&gt; dels = []
&gt;&gt;&gt; for k, v in dic.items():
 if k in ls or v in ls:
 	dels.append(k)

&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in dels:
 del dic[i]

&gt;&gt;&gt; dic
{4: 5}
 
 #2 dictionary = {1:3,4:5}
list = [1]

for key in list:
 if key in dictionary:
  del dictionary[key]
 
 #3 &gt;&gt;&gt; dictionary = {1:3,4:5}
&gt;&gt;&gt; list = [1]
&gt;&gt;&gt; for x in list:
...  if x in dictionary:
...    del(dictionary[x])
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; dictionary
{4: 5}
 
 #4 I would do something like: 

 for i in list:
 if dictionary.has_key(i):
   del dictionary[i]
 

 But I am sure there are better ways. 
 #5 A few more testcases to define how I interpret your question: 

 #!/usr/bin/env python

def test(beforedic,afterdic,removelist):
 d = beforedic
 l = removelist
 for i in l:
  for (k,v) in list(d.items()):
   if k == i or v == i:
    del d[k]

 assert d == afterdic,"d is "+str(d)

test({1:3,4:5},{4:5},[1])
test({1:3,4:5},{4:5},[3])
test({1:3,4:5},{1:3,4:5},[9])
test({1:3,4:5},{4:5},[1,3])
 
 #6 If the dictionary is small enough, it's easier to just make a new one. Removing all items whose key is in the set s from the dictionary d : 

 d = dict((k, v) for (k, v) in d.items() if not k in s)
 

 Removing all items whose key or value is in the set s from the dictionary d : 

 d = dict((k, v) for (k, v) in d.items() if not k in s and not v in s)
 
 #7 def remKeys(dictionary, list):
 for i in list:
  if i in dictionary.keys():
   dictionary.pop(i)
 return dictionary
