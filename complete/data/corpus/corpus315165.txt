Question (ID-315165): How to debug Web2py applications? Is it possible? 
By debug I mean setting breakpoints, inspect values and advance step by step. 
 Answers (Total-8): #0 I haven't used web2py, but if it runs in a terminal window, you can use standard pdb stuff. Add this line somewhere in your code: 

 import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
 

 This will invoke the debugger and break. Then you can use PDB commands: n to step to the next line, l to list code, s to step into a function, p to print values, etc. 
 #1 You can do remote debugging of python web apps over TCP/IP with winpdb . 
 #2 One can debug applications built on Web2py using the following set-up: 

 
 Eclipse IDE 
 Install Pydev into Eclipse 
 Set Breakpoints on your code as needed 
 Within Eclipse right-click the file web2py.py and select Debug As -> Python Run 
 When a breakpoint is hit Eclipse will jump to the breakpoint where you can inspect variables and step thru the code 
 
 #3 Yes, it is possible, Due to the "span prevention" I am still not allowed to post screenshots, but here is a full screenshot hosted at my website:

 #4 Follow this guide. 
 #5 I'm debugging web2py applications with Eclipse and PyDev. Here is an article:

 #6 As Carl stated, it is as easy as: 

 
 Installing PyDev in Eclipse 
 Right Click on your Web2Py project, selecting Debug As > Python Run 
 Selecting web2py.py as the file to run 
 

 No other plugins or downloads are needed. 
 #7 Here is an article on debugging python with pdb, which will work with web2py. http://sontek.net/debugging-python-with-pdb
