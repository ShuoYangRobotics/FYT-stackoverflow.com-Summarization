Question (ID-3190122): Python: how to print range a-z? 1. Print a-n: a b c d e f g h i j k l m n 

 2. Every second in a-n: a c e g i k m 

 3. Append a-n to index of urls{hello.com/, hej.com/, ..., hallo.com/}: hello.com/a hej.com/b ... hallo.com/n 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 &gt;&gt;&gt; import string
&gt;&gt;&gt; string.lowercase[:14]
'abcdefghijklmn'
&gt;&gt;&gt; string.lowercase[:14:2]
'acegikm'
 

 To do the urls, you could use something like this 

 [i+j for i,j in zip(list_of_urls, string.lowercase[:14])]
 
 #1 Hints: 

 import string
print string.ascii_lowercase
 

 and 

 for i in xrange(0, 10, 2):
 print i
 

 and 

 "hello{0}, world!".format('z')
 
 #2 for one in range(97,110):
 print chr(one)
 
 #3 This is your 2nd question: string.lowercase[ord('a')-97:ord('n')-97:2] because 97==ord('a') -- if you want to learn a bit you should figure out the rest yourself ;-) 
 #4 Assuming this is a homework ;-) - no need to summon libraries etc - it probably expect you to use range() with chr/ord, like so: 

 for i in range(ord('a'), ord('n')+1):
 print chr(i),
 

 For the rest, just play a bit more with the range()

 Zip -function, full explanation , returns a list of tuples, where the i-th tuple contains the i-th element from each of the argument sequences or iterables. [...] construct is called list comprehension , very cool feature!
