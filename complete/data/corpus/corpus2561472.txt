Question (ID-2561472): fabric and svn password Assuming that I cannot run something like this with Fabric: 

 run("svn update --password 'password' .") 

 how's the proper way to pass to Fabric the password for the remote interactive command line? 

 The problem is that the repo is checked out as svn+ssh and I don't have a http/https/svn option 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Try SSHkey. It's allow you to connect to the server without password.
In this case, you will have to setup a sshkey between your remote server and the repo. 

 At remote server: Generate key pair 

 $ ssh-keygen -t dsa
 

 Leave the passphase empty! 
This will gerenate 2 files 

 
 ~/.ssh/id_dsa (private key) 
 ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub (public key) 
 

 Then, append the content in id_dsa.pub to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys at repo server. 

 Your remote server will be able to update the source tree without using password. 
 #1 We had a problem similar to this a while back and actually proposed a new feature for Fabric, but the developer we spoke to suggested this instead. 

 import getpass
password = getpass.getpass('Enter SVN Password: ')
run("svn update --password '%s'" % password)
 

 This will prompt you for a password when the time comes for fabric to run this command. 

 I believe that will display your password in the fabric log, however, so a better option would be to get SVN to prompt you for the password and echo the password into it. 

 run('echo %s | svn update --password' % password)
 

 I don't use SVN though, so I'm afraid I'm not sure if that is possible. I hope someone else can help there! 
 #2 My standard answer for automating interactive command lines is "use Expect", but you're using Python, so I will slightly refine that to "use Pexpect ". 

 It might take a bit of thought to integrate Pexpect within Fabric, or perhaps you will just end up falling back to Pexpect alone for this particular case. But it's definitely the way I would go. 
 #3 You might need to supply the user as well? If not, you may have better luck exporting your repo and making a tar of it (locally) to upload+deploy on the server. If you run the svn commands locally, you'll be able to get prompted for your username and/or password. 
 #4 You should take a look at the Fabric's env documentation . There states that you should make something like this: 

 from fabric.api import env

env.user = 'your_user'
env.password = 'your_password'
 

 Hope it helps! 
 #5 If yout just want to hide your password from log, you can use something like this: 

 from fabric.state import output

def xrun(command, hidden='', *args, **kwargs):
 old_state = output.running
 output.running = False
 print '[%s] run: %s' % (env.host_string, command)
 run(command + hidden, *args, **kwargs)
 output.running = command

xrun('svn update', '--password "your password"')
