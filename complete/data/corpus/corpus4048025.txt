  wxPython - 902 
 
  pyQt -  624 
 
  Tinkter - 521 
 
  pyGtk - 494 
 

 

 Im not in any way suggesting the above is a measure of popularity. Merely providing some statisics that I thought others may find interesting. 
 #2 I've never conducted a survey, but I am reasonably confident that PyGtk and WxPython are the most popular across all platforms. 

 What I can say for certainty is that PyGtk, WxPython, PyQt, and at some point in the future PySide, are all mature enough that it would be very unwise to choose one based on popularity. 
 #3 To quote the BDFL: 

 
 wxPython is the best and most mature cross-platform GUI toolkit,
 given a number of constraints. The only reason wxPython isn't
 the standard Python GUI toolkit is that Tkinter was there first.

 #4 How about IronPython + WPF? 
 #5 Last I knew, TkInter was the most popular (cited here as the "de-facto standard GUI package"). 
 #6 WXpython is used a lot, this blog has many, 
many examples to get you quickly started with it:

 #7 I'd say Tkinter; it comes with every distribution of Python. 2.7 on Tkinter supports ttk(themed Tkinter), which allows Tkinter to have a more native look. This was one of the main drawbacks of earlier versions of Tkinter.
