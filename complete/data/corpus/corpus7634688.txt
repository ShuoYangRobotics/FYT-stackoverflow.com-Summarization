Question (ID-7634688): python: adding to a dict gives error playlist = {}
playlist.update(position, title)
 

 here position and title are two strings. 
I am getting the following error: 
TypeError: update expected at most 1 arguments, got 2 

 could some please help?
thanks 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 dict.update() expects a dictionary: 

 playlist = {}
playlist.update({position: title})
 

 If you just want to set a single key, don't use update - use bracket notation instead: 

 playlist[position] = title
 
 #1 You can only update a dict with another dictionnary (you could also give it an iterable of tuples (key, value) : 

 playlist = {item1 : value1}
playlist.update({position : title})
print playlist

&gt;&gt;&gt; {item1 : value1, position : title}

playlist.update([(item2, value2),])
print playlist
&gt;&gt;&gt; {item1 : value1, position : title, item2: value2}
 
 #2 You must pass a dict as argument: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; a = {}
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.update({'a': 1})
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
{'a': 1}
 
 #3 playlist[position] = title
 

 This is the way you should do this. Update is handy when you try to copy elements of one dict into another one. 
 #4 Use this: 

 playlist[position] = title
 

 playlist.update is to be used with a dictionary as an argument: 

 playlist.update({position: title})
