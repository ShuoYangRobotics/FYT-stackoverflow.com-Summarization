Question (ID-6455145): python:extract certain part of string I have a string from which I would like to extract certain part. The string looks like : 

 E:/test/my_code/content/dir/disp_temp_2.hgx
 

 This is a path on a machine for a specific file with extension hgx 

 I would exactly like to capture "disp_temp_2". The problem is that I used strip function, does not work for me correctly as there are many '/'. Another problem is that, that the above location will change always on the computer. 

 Is there any method so that I can capture the exact string between the last '/' and '.' 

 My code looks like: 

 path = path.split('.')
 

 .. now I cannot split based on the last '/'. 

 Any ideas how to do this? 

 Thanks 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Use the os.path module: 

 import os.path
filename = "E:/test/my_code/content/dir/disp_temp_2.hgx"
name = os.path.basename(filename).split('.')[0]
 
 #1 Python comes with the os.path module, which gives you much better tools for handling paths and filenames: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; import os.path
&gt;&gt;&gt; p = "E:/test/my_code/content/dir/disp_temp_2.hgx"
&gt;&gt;&gt; head, tail = os.path.split(p)
&gt;&gt;&gt; tail
'disp_temp_2.hgx'
&gt;&gt;&gt; os.path.splitext(tail)
('disp_temp_2', '.hgx')
 
 #2 Standard libs are cool: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; from os import path
&gt;&gt;&gt; f = "E:/test/my_code/content/dir/disp_temp_2.hgx"
&gt;&gt;&gt; path.split(f)[1].rsplit('.', 1)[0]
'disp_temp_2'
 
 #3 Try this: 

 path=path.rsplit('/',1)[1].split('.')[0]
 
 #4 path = path.split('/')[-1].split('.')[0] works. 
 #5 You can use the split on the other part : 

 path = path.split('/')[-1].split('.')[0]
