Question (ID-3612094): Better way to zip files in Python (zip a whole directory with a single command)? Suppose I have a directory: /home/user/files/ . This dir has a bunch of files: 

 /home/user/files/
 -- test.py
 -- config.py
 

 I want to zip this directory using ZipFile in python. Do I need to loop through the directory and add these files recursively , or is it possible do pass the directory name and the ZipFile class automatically adds everything beneath it? 

 In the end, I would like to have: 

 /home/user/files.zip (and inside my zip, I dont need to have a /files folder inside the zip:)
 -- test.py
 -- config.py
 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Note that this doesn't include empty directories. If those are required there are workarounds available on the web; probably best to get the ZipInfo record for empty directories in our favorite archiving programs to see what's in them. 

 Hardcoding file/path to get rid of specifics of my code... 

 target_dir = '/tmp/zip_me_up'
zip = zipfile.ZipFile('/tmp/example.zip', 'w', zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED)
rootlen = len(target_dir) + 1
for base, dirs, files in os.walk(target_dir):
 for file in files:
  fn = os.path.join(base, file)
  zip.write(fn, fn[rootlen:])
 
 #1 I don't know about any shortcuts in the zip module, but there are some snippets out there:

 #2 You could use subprocess module: 

 import subprocess

PIPE = subprocess.PIPE
pd = subprocess.Popen(['/usr/bin/zip', '-r', 'files', 'files'],
      stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)
stdout, stderr = pd.communicate()
 

 The code is not tested and pretends to works just on unix machines, i don't know if windows has similar command line utilities. 
 #3 You could try using the distutils package: 

 distutils.archive_util.make_zipfile(base_name, base_dir[, verbose=0, dry_run=0])
 
 #4 You might also be able to get away with using the zip command available in the Unix shell with a call to os.system 
 #5 if you are just wanting to zip up python files there is this:
