Question (ID-7911504): Python string operation, extract text between html tags I have a string: 

 &lt;font face="ARIAL,HELVETICA" size="-2"&gt; 
JUL 28   &lt;/font&gt;
 

 (it outputs over two lines, so there must be a \n in there. 

 I wish to extract the string that's in between the &lt;font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; tags. In this case, it's JUL 28, but it might be another date or some other number. 

 1) The best way to extract the value from between the font tags? I was thinking I could extract everything in between "&gt; and &lt;/ . 

 edit: second question removed. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 While it may be possible to parse arbitrary HTML with regular expressions, it's often a death trap. There are great tools out there for parsing HTML, including BeautifulSoup , which is a Python lib that can handle broken as well as good HTML fairly well. 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup as BSHTML
&gt;&gt;&gt; BS = BSHTML("""
... &lt;font face="ARIAL,HELVETICA" size="-2"&gt; 
... JUL 28   &lt;/font&gt;"""
... )
&gt;&gt;&gt; BS.font.contents[0].strip()
u'JUL 28'
 

 Then you just need to parse the date: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; datetime.strptime(BS.font.contents[0].strip(), '%b %d')
&gt;&gt;&gt; datetime.datetime(1900, 7, 28, 0, 0)
datetime.datetime(1900, 7, 28, 0, 0)
 
 #1 You have a bunch of options here. You could go for an all-out xml parser like lxml, though you seem to want a domain-specific solution. I'd go with a multiline regex: 

 import re
rex = re.compile(r'&lt;font.*?&gt;(.*?)&lt;/font&gt;',re.S|re.M)
...
data = """&lt;font face="ARIAL,HELVETICA" size="-2"&gt; 
JUL 28   &lt;/font&gt;"""

match = rex.match(data)
if match:
 text = match.groups()[0].strip()
 

 Now that you have text , you can turn it into a date pretty easily: 

 from datetime import datetime
date = datetime.strptime(text, "%b %d")
 
 #2 Or, you could simply use Beautiful Soup : 

 
 Beautiful Soup is a Python HTML/XML parser designed for quick turnaround projects like screen-scraping 
 
 #3 Is grep an option? 

 grep "&lt;[^&gt;]*&gt;(.*)&lt;\/[^&gt;]*&gt;" file
 

 The (.*) should match your content. 
 #4 Use Scrapy's XPath selectors as documented at http://doc.scrapy.org/en/0.10.3/topics/selectors.html 

 Alternatively you can utilize an HTML parser such as BeautifulSoup especially if want to operate on the document in an object oriented manner.

 #5 Python has a library called HTMLParser . Also see the following question posted in SO which is very similar to what you are looking for:
