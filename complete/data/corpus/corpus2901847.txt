Question (ID-2901847): Integer array in Python How I can define array of integer numbers in Python code 

 Say if this code is ok. or no 

 pos = [int]

len = 99

for i in range (0,99):
 pos[i]=7
 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Why not just: 

 pos = [7] * 99
 

 This is the most pythonic, in my opinion. 
 #1 import array

pos = array.array('l', 7 * [99])
 

 The array module of Python's standard library is the only way to make an array that comes with Python (the third-party module numpy offers other ways, but needs do be downloaded and installed separately) -- what your Q is doing, as well as every answer so far, is building a list , not an array . 

 In particular, there is no constraint that the pos list built in your Q and the several As contains just integers -- while, with the snippet I give, you do get that constraint (32-bit signed integers in this case, to be precise), which rigidly limits you but also saves a bunch of memory (an array of integers should take about one fifth the amount of memory that a list filled with integers will take, unless there's a lot of perennial duplication in the lists' items). 

 BTW, if you say array when you mean list (just in case list is what you meant), you're sure to cause a lot of confusion -- saying what you mean, and meaning what you say, helps a lot in clear communication, unsurprisingly!-) 
 #2 you do not declare the type of variables in python, so no pos=[int] 
all you have to do: 

 pos=[]
for i in range(99):
 pos.append(7)
 
 #3 You can simply do 

 pos = [7] * 99
print pos #will print the whole array [7, 7, .... 7]
 
 #4 If you just want to declare the array, all you have to do in python is: 

 pos = []
 

 If you want to fill the array with 99 7's: 

 pos = [7] * 99
 

 If you want to fill the array based on a pattern: 

 pos = [i for i in range(99)]
 
 #5 One way is: 

 pos = [7 for _ in xrange(0,99)]
 

 in Python 2 or: 

 pos = [7 for _ in range(0,99)]
 

 in Python 3. These are list comprehensions , and are easy to extend for more complex work. 

 Also: 

 pos = [int]
 

 doesn't make much sense. You're creating a list with the only element being the type int.
