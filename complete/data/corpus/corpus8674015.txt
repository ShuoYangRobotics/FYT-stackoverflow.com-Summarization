Question (ID-8674015): List of Lists: finding a value throughout I am using Python to write a program that looks through lists of lists and changes values. 

 In my list of lists I have 3's and I want to find their index. Right now I can only get it to work on the first row. I want it to find 3's on any of the lists in "numbers." 

 Here is some sample code to wash away the mud: 

 numbers = [
 [3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6],
 [8, 0, 0, 0, 4, 7, 5, 0, 3],
 [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 7, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 2, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
 [7, 0, 8, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5],
 [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
 ]
a = -1
while a:
 try:
  for row in numbers:
   a = row[a+1:].index(3) + a + 1
   print("Found 3 at index", a)
 except ValueError:
  break
 

 When I run it I get: 

 Found 3 at index 0
Found 3 at index 1
Found 3 at index 2
Found 3 at index 4
Found 3 at index 5
Found 3 at index 6
Found 3 at index 8
 

 Which shows that it is working but only on the first row. 

 Thanks! 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 If you only want to get the row index, iterate over numbers using enumerate [docs] and test whether 3 is in the list using in [docs] : 

 for index, row in enumerate(numbers):
 if 3 in row:
  print "3 found in row %i" % index
 

 For row and column index, iterate over both lists: 

 for index, row in enumerate(numbers):
 for col, value in enumerate(row):
  if value == 3:
   print "3 found in row %i at position %i" % (index, col)
 

 If you just want to get the indexes in a new list, you can use list comprehension [docs] : 

 indexes = [(row, col) for row, r in enumerate(numbers) for col, val in enumerate(r) if val == 3]
 
 #1 Here's a little code snippet to get you started: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; for i, row in enumerate(numbers):
  if 3 in row:
   print i, row.index(3) 

1 8
2 5
7 3
8 0

&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers[1][8]
3
&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers[2][5]
3
&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers[7][3]
3
&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers[8][0]
3
 
 #2 Try the following: 

 [[i for i, v in enumerate(row) if v == 3] for row in numbers]
 

 This will result in a list of lists where each entry in the inner lists is an index of a 3 in the corresponding row from the original list: 

 [[], [8], [5], [], [], [], [], [3], [0]]
 

 You said you were looking for 3 but your code appears to be looking for 0, which do you want? 

 You could use it like this: 

 threes = [[i for i, v in enumerate(row) if v == 3] for row in numbers]
for row, indices in enumerate(threes):
 for col in indices:
  print "3 found in row %d, column %d" % (row, col)
 
 #3 Instead of displaying the information, let's actually build up a data structure that gives us the "coordinates" of every 3 : 

 x = [
 (r, c)
 for r, row in enumerate(numbers)
 for c, cell in enumerate(row)
 if cell == 3
]
 

 And we can easily verify it: 

 assert(all(numbers[r][c] == 3 for r, c in x))
 

 But if you want to replace values, it's silly to try to build up this list and then use it to manually go back in and replace stuff. Much cleaner to just produce the desired output directly. That is, "a list of lists such that the value is None (let's say, for the sake of argument) if the corresponding original value is 3 , and otherwise the original value)". 

 That's spelled like 

 [[None if cell == 3 else cell for cell in row] for row in numbers]
 
 #4 It is not perfectly clear what you want to achieve in the first place. Your code is not consistent with the problem you describe. At least in my view. But let's start with this: 

 
 I am using Python to write a program that looks through lists of lists and changes values. 
 

 So you apparantly want to find and replace values in a list. There are SO questions on this topic, therefore I suggest the following solution for this task ( adapted from here ): 

 def replace_in_iter(it, predicate, replacement=None):
 for item in it:
 if predicate(item): yield replacement
 else: yield item
 

 then you can do: (to replace all occurances of 3 with an arbitrary None ) 

 new_numbers = [list(replace_in_iter(row, lambda x:x==3)) for row in numbers]
 
 #5 Try using scipy/numpy to do this 

 import scipy as sp
matrix = your_matrix #write your matrix here. I left it.
x,y = sp.where(matrix == 3)
for i in range(len(x)):
 print x[i],y[i]
 
 #6 Try this solution: 

 def findIndexes(matrix, n):
 for i in xrange(len(matrix)):
  for j in xrange(len(matrix[i])):
   if matrix[i][j] == n:
    print 'found %d at index %d, %d' % (n, i, j)
 

 The above will tell you for a given n value, the exact coordinates in which is located, for all rows and columns in the given matrix parameter. For example: 

 findIndexes(numbers, 0)
