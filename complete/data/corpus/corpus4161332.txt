Question (ID-4161332): How can I include python script in a HTML file? How do I put this python script: 

 a = ['f','d','s','a']
x = -1
scope = vars()
for i in a:
 scope['x']+=1
 print a[x]
 

 inside of a html file. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 If your web server supports it, you could run it as a CGI script to output an HTML file - more information here: http://www.penzilla.net/tutorials/python/cgi/ 

 You would need to modify your script to ouput valid HTML, but that tutorial should get you started. 

 Good luck! 
 #1 Something like this, if you want to create an html, not necessarily display it: 

 html_file = open('namehere.html','w')
 a = ['f','d','s','a']
 x = -1
 scope = vars()
 data = ''
 for i in a: #TIP: use a generator
  scope['x']+=1
  data += a[x]
  data += '\n'
 html_file.write(data)
 html_file.close()
 
 #2 if the script is in a server , you can run it using remote funcion call through JSON-RPC 
you may refer the JSON-RPC documentation here 
 #3 Surround it with a &lt;body&gt; and &lt;head&gt; tag and you're golden. 

 But seriously, I think what you are trying to do is print fdsa, which would would look like this: 

 &lt;head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
fdsa
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
 

 What you have there is not really a python script. You might need to correct that first, and then give a little more explanation what you are trying to do. 
 #4 Perhaps CGI is what you are looking for: 

 http://docs.python.org/library/cgi.html 

 http://www.penzilla.net/tutorials/python/cgi/ 

 For example: 

 print "Content-Type: text/html"  # HTML is following
print        # blank line, end of headers

print "&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;pre&gt;"
a = ['f','d','s','a']
x = -1
scope = vars()
for i in a:
 scope['x']+=1
 print a[x]
print "&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"
 

 Hope this helps. Good luck! 
 #5 Not possible. Python isn't like PHP; I can't just do this 

 &lt;?php
 

 And be good to go. 

 However, if your web server has a Python interpreter (most all do, these days), you can write CGI (common gateway interface) scripts to make Python code run on your webpage. 

 If you're trying to generate dynamic content (like change words in HTML), Javascript or PHP is better. Python is more suited to web applications.
