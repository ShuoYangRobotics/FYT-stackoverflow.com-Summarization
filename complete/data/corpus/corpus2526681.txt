Question (ID-2526681): I need a simple command line program to transform XML using an XSL Stylesheet I am on OSX Snow Leopard (10.6.2) I can install anything I need to. I would preferably like a Python or Java solution. I have searched on Google and found lots of information on writing my own program to do this, but this is a just a quick and dirty experiment so I don't want to invest a lot of time on writing a bunch of code to do this, I am sure someone else has done this already. 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 Have you tried ' xsltproc '? It's probably already installed. 

 http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/xsltproc2.html 
 #1 Use lxml . It is very easy to use and very fast. It can work with XPath and includes a XSLT transformer . 
 #2 I'd recommend Saxon , which can be run from the command line like so: 

 java -jar /path/to/saxon.jar xmlfile xslfile
 
 #3 If I assume correctly that you want to supply a stylesheet and an XML document then Xalan-J has a command line feature you can use to do this: 

 http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/commandline.html 

 which can be invoked with: 

 java org.apache.xalan.xslt.Process -IN foo.xml -XSL foo.xsl -OUT foo.out
 
 #4 http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/ 
 #5 Have you seen XMLStarlet (an XML command line toolset) ? It does lots of XML-related querying transformation, and in particular: 

 xml tr --help
XMLStarlet Toolkit: Transform XML document(s) using XSLT
Usage: xml tr [&lt;options&gt;] &lt;xsl-file&gt; {-p|-s &lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;} [ &lt;xml-file-or-uri&gt; ... ]
where
 &lt;xsl-file&gt;  - main XSLT stylesheet for transformation
 &lt;xml-file&gt;  - input XML document file name (stdin is used if missing)
 &lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt; - name and value of the parameter passed to XSLT processor
 -p    - parameter is XPATH expression ("'string'" to quote string)
 -s    - parameter is a string literal
 

 Further documentation here . 
 #6 I have used Saxon 6.5 for years for command line transformations. (Java, XSLT 1) 

 An excellent fallback if a native solution is not available.
