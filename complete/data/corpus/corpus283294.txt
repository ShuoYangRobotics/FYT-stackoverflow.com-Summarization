Question (ID-283294): Django debugging with Emacs I found a lot of info about how to debug simple Python programs with Emacs. But what if I want to debug a Django application?
I run the development server and I would like to somehow attach to the process from Emacs and then set breakpoints, etc. Similar to Visual Studio's "attach to process". How to do that? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 This isn't emacs specific, but you can use the Python debugger by adding the following to a Django view function: 

 import pdb; pdb.set_trace() 

 Now when you run the development server and view the page, your browser will appear to hang or load very slowly - switch over to your console, and you have access to the full debugger. You can inspect AND modify state of your application via an interactive shell - check out the Python documentation for the debugger, or this link for some Python debugging examples 

 

 If all you need is logging, add the following to your settings.py : 

 logging.basicConfig(
 level = logging.DEBUG,
 format = '%(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(message)s',
 filename = '/tmp/mylog.log',
 filemode = 'w'
)
 

 Now you can log messages to /tmp/mylog.log by adding the following to any view function: 

 import logging
logging.debug("Something happened")
 
 #1 Start pdb like this: 

 M-x pdb
python manage.py runserver --noreload
 

 Once you have the (Pdb) prompt, you need to do this: 

 import sys
sys.path.append('/path/to/directory/containing/views.py')
 

 Once you've done this, you should be able to set breakpoints normally. Just navigate to the line number you want, and 

 M-x space
 
 #2 Here's something I found last night that will do exactly what you want when the program crashes: 

 http://code.google.com/p/django-command-extensions/ 

 Once you install that you can run:
python manage.py runserver_plus
and you will have an interactive AJAX console on your Error page. (Obviously, be careful with the amount of access people have to this web server when running in that mode.) 
 #3 I don't really know anything about it, but putting "debugging Python with emacs" into Google gave me this page about debugging twisted with emacs , so it seems to be possible. 
 #4 About the general non-emacs-exclusive way, there is a very nice screencast out there you might be interested in: http://ericholscher.com/blog/2008/aug/31/using-pdb-python-debugger-django-debugging-series-/ 

 The emacs integration described above doesn't work for me yet. It doesn't really seem to connect to the running application. Further the command to set a breakpoint is not M-x space but C-x space. 

 Furhter I consider this blog post here very interesting: http://panela.blog-city.com/python_and_emacs_5_pdb_and_emacs.htm

 #5 Because recent versions of Emacs python mode do support 'pdbtrack' functionality by default, all you need is just set up breakpoint in your code this way: 

 import pdb; pdb.set_trace() 

 Also, you have to start your Django application devserver from within Emacs shell: 

 C-x shell 

 And so type there: 

 ./manage.py runserver 

 P.S. No need for specific pdb sessions or --noreload flag. Noreload would require you to manually restart your applications and so I do not find this useful for Emacs.
