Question (ID-418835): Are there any graph/plotting/anything-like-that libraries for Python 3.0? As per the title. I am trying to create a simple scater plot, but haven't found any Python 3.0 libraries that can do it. Note, this isn't for a website, so the web ones are a bit useless. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Maybe you can use Python Imaging Library (PIL).
Also have a look at PyX, but this library is meant to output to PDF, ... 
 #1 The GChartWrapper ( http://pypi.python.org/pypi/GChartWrapper/0.7 ) does work for py3k 
 #2 I'm sure I'll get modded down for this but, why do you need to use python 3 to make a graph? 
 #3 Have you looked at the Google Chart Wrapper? 

 http://pypi.python.org/pypi/GChartWrapper/0.7 
 #4 I would call Gnuplot from Python. No need to reinvent the wheel in Python, Gnuplot is already there and already has a Python interface. 
 #5 The current development version of matplotlib should work on Python 3.
