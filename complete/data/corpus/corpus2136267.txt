Question (ID-2136267): Beautiful Soup and extracting a div and its contents by ID soup.find("tagName", { "id" : "articlebody" })
 

 Why does this NOT return the &lt;div id="articlebody"&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt; tags and stuff in between? It returns nothing. And I know for a fact it exists because I'm staring right at it from 

 soup.prettify()
 

 soup.find("div", { "id" : "articlebody" }) also does not work. 

 Edit: There is no answer to this post - how do I delete it? I found that BeautifulSoup is not parsing correctly, which probably actually means the page I'm trying to parse isn't properly formatted in SGML or whatever. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 You should post your example document, because the code works fine: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; import BeautifulSoup
&gt;&gt;&gt; soup = BeautifulSoup.BeautifulSoup('&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div id="articlebody"&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html')
&gt;&gt;&gt; soup.find("div", {"id": "articlebody"})
&lt;div id="articlebody"&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;
 

 Finding &lt;div&gt; s inside &lt;div&gt; s works as well: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; soup = BeautifulSoup.BeautifulSoup('&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articlebody"&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html')
&gt;&gt;&gt; soup.find("div", {"id": "articlebody"})
&lt;div id="articlebody"&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;
 
 #1 In the beautifulsoup source this line allows divs to be nested within divs; so your concern in lukas' comment wouldn't be valid. 

 NESTABLE_BLOCK_TAGS = ['blockquote', 'div', 'fieldset', 'ins', 'del']
 

 What I think you need to do is to specify the attrs you want such as 

 source.find('div', attrs={'id':'articlebody'})
 
 #2 I think there is a problem when the 'div' tags are too much nested. I am trying to parse some contacts from a facebook html file, and the Beautifulsoup is not able to find tags "div" with class "fcontent". 

 This happens with other classes as well. When I search for divs in general, it turns only those that are not so much nested. 

 The html source code can be any page from facebook of the friends list of a friend of you (not the one of your friends). If someone can test it and give some advice I would really appreciate it. 

 This is my code, where I just try to print the number of tags "div" with class "fcontent": 

 from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup 
f = open('/Users/myUserName/Desktop/contacts.html')
soup = BeautifulSoup(f) 
list = soup.findAll('div', attrs={'class':'fcontent'})
print len(list)
 
 #3 have you tried soup.findAll("div", {"id": "articlebody"}) ? 

 sounds crazy, but if you're scraping stuff from the wild, you can't rule out multiple divs... 
 #4 I used: 

 soup.findAll('tag', attrs={'attrname':"attrvalue"})
 

 As my syntax for find/findall; that said, unless there are other optional parameters between the tag and attribute list, this shouldn't be different. 
 #5 Here is a code fragment 

 soup = BeautifulSoup(:"index.html")
titleList = soup.findAll('title')
divList = soup.findAll('div', attrs={ "class" : "article story"})
 

 As you can see I find all tags and then I find all tags with class="article" inside
