Question (ID-316325): "import wx" fails after installation of wxPython on Windows XP I downloaded and installed this version of wxPython for use with my Python 2.6 installation: 

 http://downloads.sourceforge.net/wxpython/wxPython2.8-win32-unicode-2.8.9.1-py26.exe 

 When I run Python and try to import wx, I get the following error: 

 C:\Program Files\Console2&gt;python
Python 2.6 (r26:66721, Oct 2 2008, 11:35:03) [MSC v.1500 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; import wx
Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
 File "c:\Python26\lib\site-packages\wx-2.8-msw-unicode\wx\__init__.py", line 45, in &lt;module&gt;
 from wx._core import *
 File "c:\Python26\lib\site-packages\wx-2.8-msw-unicode\wx\_core.py", line 4, in &lt;module&gt;
 import _core_
ImportError: DLL load failed: This application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
 

 I have already tried removing wxPython and installing again and I got the same error. How can I fix this problem? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 I was getting the same error. 

 After some googling found this link to MSVC++ 2008 Redestributable and installed it. 

 That solved the problem. 
 #1 Try the ANSI version instead of the Unicode one. IIRC it needs to match the Python 2.6 install to work properly. 
 #2 From looking for "application configuration is incorrect" in the wxPython trac system , the only reference that might make sense is a 64-bit vs 32-bit compatibility issue. 

 Otherwise, I'd say Brian's answer of trying ANSI is pretty good. 

 BTW, if you try uninstalling again, make go into the site-packages folder and make sure all the wx and wxPython stuff is deleted. 
 #3 Copy the Microsoft C runtime library v.9 files and manifest. That is, msvcr90.dll and microsoft.vc90.crt.manifest from folder python to the folder wx, tha is, folder which contains failed to start DLLs. 

 Or install the Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package. 
 #4 I too have the same issue.Better install "Portable Python" IDE which comes with some nice modules including wxPython .You can start coding GUI immediately without the need to download a separate wxPython.The link ,

 #5 Hate to say this, but I had the same problem, and and import worked fine after a reboot.
