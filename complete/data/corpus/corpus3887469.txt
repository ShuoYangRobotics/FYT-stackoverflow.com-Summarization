Question (ID-3887469): python: how to convert currency to decimal? i have dollars in a string variable 

 dollars = '$5.99'
 

 how do i convert this to a decimal instead of a string so that i can do operations with it like adding dollars to it? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 If you'd prefer just an integer number of cents: 

 cents_int = int(round(float(dollars.strip('$'))*100))
 

 If you want a Decimal, just use... 

 from decimal import Decimal
dollars_dec = Decimal(dollars.strip('$'))
 

 If you know that the dollar sign will always be there, you could use dollars[1:] instead of dollars.strip('$') , but using strip() lets you also handle strings that omit the dollar sign ( 5.99 instead of $5.99 ). 
 #1 If you want to use Decimal: 

 from decimal import Decimal
dollars = Decimal(dollars.strip('$'))
 

 From there adding is pretty simple 

 dollars += 1 # Would add 1 to your decimal
 
 #2 Through decimal package 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; dollars = '$5.99'
&gt;&gt;&gt; import decimal
&gt;&gt;&gt; decimal.Decimal(dollars[1:])
Decimal('5.99')
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
 
 #3 If you are only going to be adding (and not multiplying or dividing) consider just storing cents instead of dollars and not using the decimal package. I suggest using the simplest tool for the job, and decimal doesn't provide any value if you are just adding dollars and cents. 
 #4 First, strip off the '$' character. If it's always consistently the first character, that's easy: 

 dollars[1:]
 

 To keep the cents perfect without worrying about the non-perfect representation of cents in floating point, you'll want to use Decimal values: 

 from decimal import *
Decimal(dollars[1:])
 
 #5 If you want to keep moneys in cents for easy rounding and sometimes '$' is missing: 

 for dollars in ('$5.99','6.77'):
 cents = int(float((dollars[1:] if dollars.startswith('$') else dollars))*100)
 print '%s = %i cents = %i dollars and %i cents' % ((dollars, cents)+divmod(cents, 100))
