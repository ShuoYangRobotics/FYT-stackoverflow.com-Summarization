Question (ID-1967220): Is there any Visual Studio-like tool for creating GUIs for Python? My girlfriend asked me if there was a tool (actually, an IDE) that would let her create her GUI visually and edit functions associated with GUI-related events with little effort. 

 For example, she wants to double-click a button she just created and immediately see (and edit) the code associated with that button's on-click event. I believe this is what she does in Visual Studio. 

 The toolkit doesn't matter. She just wants this funcionality. 

 Is there some tool that accomplishes this? 

 Thank you. 

 EDIT: Made the example look bold. Seemed no one was looking at it, and it's an important requirement. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 I would recommend based on your needs: 

 
 Qt Designer 
 wxGlade 
 

 Check this out:

 #1 For GTK+ there is Glade . Python can load interface files created with Glade. There are some tutorials on the net. 

 

 For Qt there is QtDesigner . PyQt manual covers how to use PyQt with QtDesigner . 

 As far as I know QtDesigner is integrated into some IDEs (e.g. Eclipse ) 
 #2 http://www.codeplex.com/IronPythonStudio 
 #3 Python(x,y) includes an installation of Eclipse with PyDev and QT Designer integrated. If you configure PyUIC to run from Eclipse (see this brief HOWTO ) then, once the GUI has been designed, the framework code can be generated at the push of a button. 

 Admittedly this is not as easy or as polished as VS and there may be problems when it comes to refactoring the GUI ... 
 #4 WxGlade . I'm not sure if you can do the click and edit code thing, but it comes pretty close. 
 #5 Qt Creator is pretty slick. It's for C++ coding only, but Qt manages to make that a bit easier.
