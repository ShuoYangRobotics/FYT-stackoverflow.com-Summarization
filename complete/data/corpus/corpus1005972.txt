Question (ID-1005972): What is the easiest way to see if a process with a given pid exists in Python? In a POSIX system, I want to see if a given process (PID 4356, for example) is running. It would be even better if I could get metadata about that process. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Instead of os.waitpid, you can also use os.kill with signal 0: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; os.kill(8861, 0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; os.kill(12765, 0)
Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
OSError: [Errno 3] No such process
&gt;&gt;&gt;
 

 Edit: more expansively: 

 import errno
import os

def pid_exists(pid):
 try:
  os.kill(pid, 0)
 except OSError, e:
  return e.errno == errno.EPERM
 else:
  return True
 

 This works fine on my Linux box. I haven't verified that "signal 0" is actually Posix, but it's always worked on every Unix variant I've tried. 
 #1 On linux at least the /proc directory has what you are looking for. It's basically system data from the kernel represented as directories and files. All the numeric directories are details of processes. Just use the basic python os functions to get at this data: 

 #ls /proc
1  17 18675 25346 26390 28071 28674 28848 28871 29347 590 851 874 906 9621 9655  devices  iomem  modules ...

#ls /proc/1
auxv cmdline cwd environ exe fd maps mem mounts root stat statm status task wchan

#cat /proc/1/cmdline
init [3]
 
 #2  os.waitpid() might be of help: 

 try:
 os.waitpid(pid, 0)
except OSError:
 running = False
else:
 running = True
 
 #3 One way to do this to get information would be: 

 import commands
output = commands.getstatusoutput("ps -ef | awk '{print $2}' | grep MYPID")
 

 See: http://docs.python.org/library/commands.html 

 I think: 

 commands.getoutput(...)
 

 could be used to get metadata available on the ' ps ' line. Since you're using a POSIX system, I imagine ps (or equivalent) would be available (e.g. prstat under Solaris). 
 #4 Look at /proc/pid . This exists only of the process is running, and contains lots of information. 
 #5 In a portable way, by using psutil ( http://code.google.com/p/psutil/ ) 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; import psutil, os
&gt;&gt;&gt; psutil.pid_exists(342342)
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; psutil.pid_exists(os.getpid())
True
&gt;&gt;&gt;
