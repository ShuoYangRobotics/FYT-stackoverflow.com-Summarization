Question (ID-148853): Caching in urllib2? Is there an easy way to cache things when using urllib2 that I am over-looking, or do I have to roll my own?

 #1 If you don't mind working at a slightly lower level, httplib2 ( http://code.google.com/p/httplib2/ ) is an excellent HTTP library that includes caching functionality. 
 #2 You could use a decorator function such as: 

 class cache(object):
 def __init__(self, fun):
  self.fun = fun
  self.cache = {}

 def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
  key = str(args) + str(kwargs)
  try:
   return self.cache[key]
  except KeyError:
   self.cache[key] = rval = self.fun(*args, **kwargs)
   return rval
  except TypeError: # incase key isn't a valid key - don't cache
   return self.fun(*args, **kwargs)
 

 and define a function along the lines of: 

 @cache
def get_url_src(url):
 return urllib.urlopen(url).read()
 

 This is assuming you're not paying attention to HTTP Cache Controls, but just want to cache the page for the duration of the application 
 #3 I've always been torn between using httplib2, which does a solid job of handling HTTP caching and authentication, and urllib2, which is in the stdlib, has an extensible interface, and supports HTTP Proxy servers. 

 The ActiveState recipe starts to add caching support to urllib2, but only in a very primitive fashion. It fails to allow for extensibility in storage mechanisms, hard-coding the file-system-backed storage. It also does not honor HTTP cache headers. 

 In an attempt to bring together the best features of httplib2 caching and urllib2 extensibility, I've adapted the ActiveState recipe to implement most of the same caching functionality as is found in httplib2. The module is in jaraco.net as jaraco.net.http.caching . The link points to the module as it exists at the time of this writing. While that module is currently part of the larger jaraco.net package, it has no intra-package dependencies, so feel free to pull the module out and use it in your own projects. 

 Alternatively, if you have Python 2.6 or later, you can easy_install jaraco.net&gt;=1.3 and then utilize the CachingHandler with something like the code in caching.quick_test() . 

 """Quick test/example of CacheHandler"""
import logging
import urllib2
from httplib2 import FileCache
from jaraco.net.http.caching import CacheHandler

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
store = FileCache(".cache")
opener = urllib2.build_opener(CacheHandler(store))
urllib2.install_opener(opener)
response = opener.open("http://www.google.com/")
print response.headers
print "Response:", response.read()[:100], '...\n'

response.reload(store)
print response.headers
print "After reload:", response.read()[:100], '...\n'
 

 Note that jaraco.util.http.caching does not provide a specification for the backing store for the cache, but instead follows the interface used by httplib2. For this reason, the httplib2.FileCache can be used directly with urllib2 and the CacheHandler. Also, other backing caches designed for httplib2 should be usable by the CacheHandler. 
 #4 I was looking for something similar, and came across "Recipe 491261: Caching and throttling for urllib2" which danivo posted. The problem is I really dislike the caching code (lots of duplication, lots of manually joining of file paths instead of using os.path.join, uses staticmethods, non very PEP8'sih, and other things that I try to avoid) 

 The code is a bit nicer (in my opinion anyway) and is functionally much the same, with a few additions - mainly the "recache" method (example usage can be seem here , or in the if __name__ == "__main__": section at the end of the code). 

 The latest version can be found at http://github.com/dbr/tvdb_api/blob/master/cache.py , and I'll paste it here for posterity (with my application specific headers removed):

 #5 This article on Yahoo Developer Network - http://developer.yahoo.com/python/python-caching.html - describes how to cache http calls made through urllib to either memory or disk. 
 #6 @dbr: you may need to add also https responses caching with :
 def https_response(self, request, response):
  return self.http_response(request,response)
