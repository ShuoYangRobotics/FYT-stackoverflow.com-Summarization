Question (ID-369391): Is there an OpenSource BASIC interpreter in Ruby/Python? I want something simple in order to experiment/hack. I've created a lot interpreters/compilers for c and I just want something simple. A basic BASIC :D 

 If you don't know any (I've done my google search...), yacc/bison is the only way? 

 Thx 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 PLY is a great parser-creation library for Python. It has a simple BASIC interpreter as one of its example scripts. You could start there. 
 #1 None of these listed in TheFreeCountry are acceptable? None of them are in Python, but I should think that starting from XBLite might be more helpful than starting from Yacc/Bison/ PLY . 

 Also, Vb2py might be a better starting position than PLY. 

 If you must go the PLY route, however, consider the MOLE Basic grammar as a starting point rather than trying to roll your own from scratch. 
 #2 I also don't know a basic interpreter under ruby, but given enough time and interest ruby easily "supports" writing an interpreter for any language you like: Agile DSL Development
in Ruby . I must admit that this approach comes with some investment of time. :(
At the end of the presentation are some links to further readings regarding DSLs. 
 #3 You may wish to also examine the Parrot virtual machine which, according to wikipedia today, has some BASIC support. 
 #4 a miniBasic in ruby is available here . Rockit seems WAY more fun that racc. 
 #5 I have a qBasic program running on DOS 

 Would like to run it in Python+html environment using an interpreter. 

 Anyone available to handle the job?
