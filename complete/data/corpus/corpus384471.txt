Question (ID-384471): MySQL-db lib for Python 3.0? So, looking for a mysql-db-lib that is compatible with py3k/py3.0/py3000, any ideas? google turned up nothing. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 I was looking for it too, but also found nothing, so I ported MySQL-python-1.2.3 to py3k

 #1 It appears the MySQLdb is pretty much a dead project. However, pymysql is a dbapi compliant, pure-python implementation of a mysql client, and it has python 3 support. 

 EDIT: There's also MySQL Connector/Python . Same idea. 
 #2 As for future plans of MySQLdb, you might want to ask the author (Andy Dustman). 
His blog is here: http://mysql-python.blogspot.com/ 
 #3 not sure if you're still looking, but you could try this:

 #4 You're probably better off using Python 2.x at the moment. It's going to be a while before all Python packages are ported to 3.x, and I expect writing a library or application with 3.x at the moment would be quite frustrating. 
 #5 You can download the mysql-connector-python module compatible with Python3:

 Get the "source RPM", unzip it and use it (e.g. put it in your PYTHONPATH, and look at the examples).
