Question (ID-5817067): Python a = a.reverse makes the list empty? At the interpreter, 

 a = [1,2,3,4]
a = a.reverse()
 

 Next when I type a at the interpreter, I get nothing. So it seems a = a.reverse() generates an empty list. Is this by design? 

 I am using python 2.5 on windows xp. 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 list.reverse() modifies the list in-place, returns None. But if you want to protect old list, you can use reversed() function for that, it returns an iterator. 

 In [1]: a=[1,2,3,4]

In [2]: print(a.reverse())
None

In [3]: a
Out[3]: [4, 3, 2, 1]

In [4]: a=[1,2,3,4]

In [5]: print(reversed(a))
&lt;listreverseiterator object at 0x24e7e50&gt;

In [6]: list(reversed(a))
Out[6]: [4, 3, 2, 1]

In [7]: a
Out[7]: [1, 2, 3, 4]
 
 #1 reverse changes list in-place, and doesn't return anything. Thus, this is the expected usage: 

 a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
a.reverse()
a  # =&gt; [4, 3, 2, 1]
 

 If you assign the result of reverse back to a , you will overwrite all its hard work with the nonsensical return value ( None ), which is where your bug comes from. 
 #2 list is a mutable type, so list operations are in-place, and return None . 
 #3 The built-in method reverse of a list on python doesn't return the reversed list. 

 It reverses the list in place. 

 So, if you want to reverse your list, like in your code, just do: 

 a = [1,2,3,4]
a.reverse()
 
 #4 I think what you want to do is: 

 a = [1,2,3,4]
a.reverse()
 

 a is an object and the operations work on it's data, so you don't need to assign again it. 
 #5 The reverse method does the reverse 'in place' (like sort) and returns None, so after calling a.reverse() a already contains the result. 
 #6 list.reverse() just doesn't return anything, because it changes the list in-place. See this example: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1,2,3,4]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.reverse()
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
[4, 3, 2, 1]
 

 There also is the reversed function (actually a type, but doesn't matter here), which does not change the list in-place, but instead returns an iterator with the list items in the reverse order. Try: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1,2,3,4]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = list(reversed(a))
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
[4, 3, 2, 1]
