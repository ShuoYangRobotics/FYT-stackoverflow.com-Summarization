Question (ID-71151): HTML parser in Python Using the Python Documentation I found the HTML parser but I have no idea which library to import to use it, how do I find this out (bearing in mind it doesn't say on the page). 
 Answers (Total-8): #0 You probably really want BeautifulSoup , check the link for an example. 

 But in any case 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; import HTMLParser
&gt;&gt;&gt; h = HTMLParser.HTMLParser()
&gt;&gt;&gt; h.feed('&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;')
&gt;&gt;&gt; h.get_starttag_text()
'&lt;html&gt;'
&gt;&gt;&gt; h.close()
 
 #1 You should also look at html5lib for Python as it tries to parse HTML in a way that very much resembles what web browsers do, especially when dealing with invalid HTML (which is more than 90% of today's web). 
 #2 Try: 

 import HTMLParser
 

 In Python 3.0, the HTMLParser module has been renamed to html.parser
you can check about this here 

 Python 3.0 

 import html.parser
 

 Python 2.2 and above 

 import HTMLParser
 
 #3 I would recommend using Beautiful Soup module instead and it has good documentation . 
 #4 I don't recommend BeautifulSoup if you want speed. lxml is much, much faster, and you can fall back in lxml's BS soupparser if the default parser doesn't work. 
 #5 You may be interested in lxml . It is a separate package and has C components, but is the fastest. It has also very nice API, allowing you to easily list links in HTML documents, or list forms, sanitize HTML, and more. It also has capabilities to parse not well-formed HTML (it's configurable). 
 #6 There's a link to an example on the bottom of the page. 
 #7 For real world HTML processing I'd recommend BeautifulSoup . It is great and takes away much of the pain. Installation is easy.
