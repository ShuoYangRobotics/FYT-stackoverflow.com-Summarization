Question (ID-1688952): python or bash - adding " at beginning of line and ", at end of line I have text file with something like 

 first line
line nr 2
line three
 

 etc 

 And i want to generate 

 "first line",
"line nr 2",
"line three",
 

 I wonder how to do this in python or maybe in bash if it's easier/quicker. I know there is different code for opening file and different for reading only one line in python(?) but i'm not sure which option to use in this case and, more importantly, how to add these characters. Any advice would help.

 #1 For the reference, in case someone wants to do the same thing using python. There is a handy module fileinput that could be used like this: 

 import fileinput
import sys, os

for line in fileinput.input(inplace=True):
 sys.stdout.write('"%s",%s' % (line.rstrip(os.linesep), os.linesep))
 

 Then run this as a script: 

 python myscript.py file1 file2 file3
 

 That will change the files inplace for you. 
 #2 Be a true unix geek: use sed! 

 sed 's/^/"/; s/$/",/;' &lt; your_text_file
 

 If you want to escape existing double quotes with backslashes, use 's/"/\\"/g; s/^/"/; s/$/",/;' as the pattern. 

 sed is ideally suited for this type of task. Check out a ludicrously long list of examples . 
 #3 there is no need to construct regular expression(with backreferencing) for this task. Its an expensive operation since you are not going to change something in the line. Easiest way is just to print them out. 

  awk '{print "\042"$0"\042,"}' file
 

 Results on operation on a big file: 

 $ head -5 file
this is line
this is line
this is line
this is line
this is line
$ wc -l &lt; file
9545088

$ time awk '{print "\042"$0"\042,"}' file &gt;/dev/null

real 0m15.574s
user 0m15.327s
sys  0m0.172s

$ time sed 's/.*/"&amp;",/' file &gt; /dev/null

real 0m31.717s
user 0m31.465s
sys  0m0.157s

$ time perl -p -e 's/^(.*)$/\"$1\",/g' file &gt;/dev/null

real 0m36.576s
user 0m36.006s
sys  0m0.360s
 
 #4 A number of easy ways to do it... 

 A simple perl oneliner: 

 perl -pi -e 's/^(.*)$/\"$1\",/g' /path/to/your/file
 

 To explain a bit, the regex ^(.*)$ grabs everything (the (.*) ) between the start of the line ( ^ ) and the end of the line ( $ ), then uses the $1 match group variable to reconstruct it with the quotes and comma. 
 #5 In Bash: 

 while read line
 do
 echo "\"${line}\","
done &lt; inputfile
 
 #6 Python 

 for line in open("file"):
 line=line.strip()
 print '"%s",' % line
 
 #7 sh + awk are nice here too... 

 !/bin/sh
for FILE in "$@"
do
 awk '{print "\" $0 "\","}' &lt; $FILE &gt; $FILE.tmp
 mv $FILE.tmp $FILE
done
 
 #8 In vi: 

 :%s/^\(.*\)$/"\1",/g
