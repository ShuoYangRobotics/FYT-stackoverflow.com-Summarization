Question (ID-804368): Blogging System which runs on the Google App Engine What is a cool blogging engine for GAE? I really like Wordpress, but PHP isn't 
available on the GAE. 

 Which blogging systems do you use on GAE? 

 Which experiences you have made with it? 
 Answers (Total-13): #0 You could look here for a blogging-application for GAE:

 For example Bloog is mentioned there:

 #1 Take a look at bloggart , written mainly by fellow StackOverflow user Nick Johnson . His blog includes a great series that explains its implementation from the very beginning . 
 #2 cpedia has an excellent demo not just of the front end but of all the features in the admin itself. 

 In my experience GAE is a joy to play with, especially if you have any experience with Django or MVP ( or MVC as django folks prefer to say ). 
 #3 Maybe see http://brizzled.clapper.org/id/77 (no personal experience using it, myself). 
 #4 There is a python framework web2py and there are some appliances (plugins) for this framework. Although I have not tried that, you may be interested in application Wordpress Clone . 

 Installing web2py is very easy (just unzip and copy files) and web2py is guaranteed to run on GAE. 

 Anyway, this solution is for anyone who want to play with framework (and python) if you just need to blog, I recommend to go for some already installed system (wordpressn is ok, if you like it) at http://wordpress.com/ or anywhere else. 
 #5 There's PickyWiki (a CMS) by Ian Bicking (haven't used it myself) 
 #6 you'll find some blog engines for GAE (mostly GAE/P) in application section of Google App Engine as a Framework project 
 #7 I have just set up Wordpress 2.7.1 with modifications running on Quercus (PHP in Java) by way of the instructions and install here . It's incredibly impressive, but not ready for prime-time. For example, the entire admin interface doesn't work. I don't recommend it (yet). 
 #8 I just wrote my own because I couldn't find one I liked (either too simple, or too bloated), but recently I noticed Nick Johnson of the App Engine Team had written one too . I'd look at using his if I had to do it again! 
 #9 Have you tried Votay? You can download the source code at http://github.com/andrewarrow/votay 
 #10 There is a hack to get PHP running on GAE 
 #11 There is also Django based Hoydaa Blog . 
 #12 I created blog software which runs well on google app engine. I use it to power my own blog. Take a look:
