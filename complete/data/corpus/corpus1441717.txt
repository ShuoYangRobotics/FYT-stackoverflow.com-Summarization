Question (ID-1441717): Plotting color map with zip codes in R or Python I have some US demographic and firmographic data. 
I would like to plot zipcode areas in a state or a smaller region (e.g. city). Each area would be annotated by color and/or text specific to that area. The output would be similar to http://maps.huge.info/ but a) with annotated text; b) pdf output; c) scriptable in R or Python. 

 Is there any package and code that allows me to do this? 
 Answers (Total-8): #0 I am assuming you want static maps. 

 

 1) Get the shapefiles of the zip boundaries and state boundaries at census.gov: 

 2) Use the plot.heat function I posted in this SO question . 

 For example (assumes you have the maryland shapefiles in the map subdirectory): 

 library(maptools)
##substitute your shapefiles here
state.map &lt;- readShapeSpatial("maps/st24_d00.shp")
zip.map &lt;- readShapeSpatial("maps/zt24_d00.shp")
## this is the variable we will be plotting
zip.map@data$noise &lt;- rnorm(nrow(zip.map@data))
## put the lab point x y locations of the zip codes in the data frame for easy retrieval
labelpos &lt;- data.frame(do.call(rbind, lapply(zip.map@polygons, function(x) x@labpt)))
names(labelpos) &lt;- c("x","y")      
zip.map@data &lt;- data.frame(zip.map@data, labelpos)
## plot it
png(file="map.png")
## plot colors
plot.heat(zip.map,state.map,z="noise",breaks=c(-Inf,-2,-1,0,1,2,Inf))
## plot text
with(zip.map@data[sample(1:nrow(zip.map@data), 10),] , text(x,y,NAME))
dev.off()
 
 #1 There are many ways to do this in R (see the spatial view ); many of these depend on the "maps" package . 

 
 Check out this cool example of the US 2004 election . It ends up looking like this: 
 Here's a slightly ugly example of a model that uses the "maps" package with "lattice". 
 Andrew Gelman made some very nice plots like this. See, for instance, this blog post on red states/blue states and this follow up post . 
 Here's a very simple example using the "gmaps" package , which shows a map of Arrests by state for arrests per 100,000 for Murder: 

 require(gmaps)
data(USArrests)
attach(USArrests)
grid.newpage()
grid.frame(name="map")
grid.pack("map",USALevelPlot(states=rownames(USArrests),levels=Murder,col.fun=reds),height=unit(1,'null'))
grid.pack("map",gradientLegendGrob(at=quantile(Murder),col.fun=reds),side="bottom",height=unit(.2,'npc'))
detach(USArrests)
 
 
 #2 Someone may have something more direct for you, but I found O'Reilly's 'Data Mashups in R' very interesting... in part, it's a spatial mapping of home foreclosure auctions.

 #3 There is a rich and sophisticated series of packages in R to plot, do analysis, and other functions related to GIS. One place to get started is the CRAN task view on Spatial Data :
This is a complex and sometimes arcane world, and takes some work to understand. 

 If you are looking for a free, very functional mapping application, may I suggest: 

 MapWindow ( mapwindow.com) 
 #4 Daniel Levine at TechCrunch Trends has done nice things with the maps package in R. He has code available on his site, too. 

 Paul's suggestion of looking into Processing - which Ben Fry used to make zipdecode - is also a good one, if you're up for learning a (Java-like) new language. 
 #5 Depending on your application, a long way around might be to use something like this:

 To map your data. If that wasn't quite what you wanted, you can get raw zip code shapefiles from census.gov and do it manually, which is quite a pain. 

 Also, if you haven't seen it, this is a neat way to interact with similar data, and might offer some pointers:

 #6 Check out this excellent online visualization tool by IBM
 http://manyeyes.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/ 

 EDIT FYI, ManyEyes uses the Prefuse visualization toolkit for some of its viz. Even though it is a java-based framework, they also provide a Flash/ActionScript tool for the web. 
 #7 In Python, you can use shapefiles from the US census along with the basemap package. Here is an example of filling in states according to population.
