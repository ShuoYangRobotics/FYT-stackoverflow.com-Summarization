Question (ID-1414130): Django not sending emails to admins According to the documentation , if DEBUG is set to False and something is provided under the ADMINS setting, Django will send an email whenever the code raises a 500 status code. I have the email settings filled out properly (as I can use send_mail fine) but whenever I intentionally put up erroneous code I get my 500.html template but no error email is sent. What could cause Django to not do this? 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 In my case the cause was missing SERVER_EMAIL setting. 

 The default for SERVER_EMAIL is 'root@localhost'. But many of email servers including 
my email provider do not accept emails from such suspicious addresses. They silently drop the emails. 

 Changing the sender email address to 'django@my-domain.com' solved the problem. In settings.py: 

 SERVER_EMAIL = 'django@my-domain.com'
 
 #1 My web hosting provider - Webfaction - only allows emails to be sent From an email that has been explicitly created in the administrator panel. Creating one fixed the problem. 
 #2 Make sure your EMAIL_HOST and EMAIL_PORT are set up right in settings.py (these refer to your SMTP server). It might be assuming that you have an SMTP server running on localhost. 

 To test this locally, run Python's built-in test SMTP server: 

 python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer localhost:1025
 

 Then set these values in your settings.py 

 EMAIL_HOST='localhost'
EMAIL_PORT=1025
 

 Trigger a 500 error, and you should see the e-mail appear in the python smtpd terminal window. 
 #3 Although it's been a while, here's my response, so that other people can benefit in the future. 

 In my case, what was preventing emails to be sent to the ADMINS list, when an error occured, was an application specific setting. I was using django-piston, which provides the setting attributes PISTON_EMAIL_ERRORS and PISTON_DISPLAY_ERRORS. Setting these accordingly, enabled the application server to notify my by mail, whenever piston would crash. 
 #4 Try this 

 # ./manage shell
&gt;&gt;&gt; from django.core.mail import send_mail
&gt;&gt;&gt; send_mail('Subject here', 'Here is the message.', 'from@example.com',['to@example.com'], fail_silently=False)
 

 With a to@example.com that you actually get email at. 
 #5 While likely not ideal, I have found using Gmail as the SMTP host works just fine. There is a useful guide at nathanostgard.com . 

 Feel free to post your relevant settings.py sections (including EMAIL_*, SERVER_EMAIL, ADMINS (just take out your real email), MANAGERS, and DEBUG) if you want an extra set of eyes to check for typos! 
 #6 Make sure you have DEBUG = False
