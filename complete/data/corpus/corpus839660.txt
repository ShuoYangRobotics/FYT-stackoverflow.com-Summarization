Question (ID-839660): Looking for interesting and instructive python code (web programming) I'm learning python and my current focus is on web programming. Thx to some help from stackoverflow, I recently made some reasonable progress. While still at basic level, I can now "somewhat" comfortably use html templates, web frameworks (haven't done anything significant yet), sqlite (no mySQL yet), etc. 

 Before I start another project, I'd like to review some interesting/instructive code (web UI). I have been searching at all the normal places but this process is very hit or miss. 

 If anyone has code and/or links to code that they believe would help me further my education, I would be most appreciative if they would post here. 

 As an aside, I have started using the twitter APIs (easy/fun source of a ton of data) - so any code that fits the bill and uses Twitter is a bonus. 

 Thx!! 

 Update: to be clear, I'm looking more for examples like: http://code.reddit.com/ (source code for reddit). This example is beyond my abilities but is interesting nonetheless.

 Dive Into Python has been freely available for a while now. Great starting point. 
 #1 Here are some good places to start: 

 
 Django source 
 Django resources 
 
 #2 Have a look at Trac , there's some pretty instructive code in there. Just don't try to understand how its component architecture works underneath on your first read ;-) 
 #3 The code from the excellent book Programming Collective Intelligence can be found here:

 #4 Maybe not that elegant to use as django, but definitely worth a look because of clever use of the Python language: webpy 

 Just one of the many praises on its web site: 

 
 "Guido [van Rossum, creator of Python], you'll probably find that web.py best suits your style. ... If you don't like it, I can't imagine which of the other dozens of frameworks out there you would like." 
 - Phillip J. Eby, creator of the Python Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) 
 
 #5 Some code that I'm looking: 

 From Django Practical Projects book, the code(not complete) of the weblog: http://bitbucket.org/ubernostrum/practical-django-projects/src/ 

 Source of "Begginning Django E-Commerce" book: http://www.apress.com/resource/bookfile/4490 

 Source of Start The Dark web(I don't know what happened to the site): http://github.com/ericflo/startthedark 

 I hope it helps,

 #6 What about JaikuEngine 

 

 
 JaikuEngine is a social microblogging platform that runs on AppEngine. 
 

 This is the source code for jaiku.com and the code is first class. 

 Definitive a guide for python webdevelopment specially with app engine.
