Question (ID-3105495): Django form is throwing error: "takes exactly 1 argument (0 given)" I'm working on a basic event form created from a model, but I keep getting the following error message: 

 TypeError at /addlaundry/
addlaundry() takes exactly 1 argument (0 given)
 

 I think it's because I'm not passing the argument through on views, but I can't find documented anywhere how to do this right, at least not written in a way I understand. 

 Here is my urls.py: 

 urlpatterns = patterns('',
 url('^addlaundry/$', 'beacon.laundry.views.addlaundry'),
}
 

 And the views itself: 

 # Create your views here.

from schedule.views import EventForm

def addlaundry(request):
 if request.method == 'POST':
  form = EventForm(request.POST)
  if form.is_valid():
   return HttpResponseRedirect('/thanks/') #redirect after succesfully adding new delivery
 else:
  form = addlaundry()

 return render_to_response('newlaundry.html', {
  'form': form,
 })
 

 Do I indeed have my views wrongly structured, or am I missing something else? If there's documentation I need to read up on, I want to I just haven't found it but feel like I'm missing something basic. 

 Thanks,

 Answers (Total-6): #0 The problem is here: 

 form = addlaundry()
 

 You're calling your view function addlaundry which takes 1 required argument ( request ), but you're not passing it any arguments. 

 Of course, that's not the right way to construct a form, anyway. You'll want to take a look at the examples given in the Django forms documentation to see how to create and use forms in Django. 
 #1 Your view is called addlaundry , and it calls (presumably) something else called addlaundry . Rename one of them, or use the other addlaundry from inside its namespace. 
 #2 This is your problem: 

 form = addlaundry()
 

 That's attempting to call the view itself! That's not what you want. You need to define a form class and call (instantiate) it here. 
 #3 views.py : 

 from schedule.forms import EventForm

def addlaundry(request):
 if request.method == 'POST':
  form = EventForm(request.POST)
  if form.is_valid():
   return HttpResponseRedirect('/thanks/')
 else:
  form = EventForm()

 return render_to_response('newlaundry.html', {
  'form': form,
 })
 

 That means : 

 
 using a forms.py file to define your forms 
 initializing your form in a non post context (regular first page load), that will be passed to your template 
 
 #4 Also, in urls.py your view should not be a string. 
 #5 else:
 form = addlaundry()
 

 Just as the exception says: The view function needs 1 argument, but you didn't supply any.
