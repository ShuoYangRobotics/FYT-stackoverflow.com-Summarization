Question (ID-5136447): Function for Factorial in Python How do I go about computing a factorial of an integer in Python? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Easiest way: math.factorial(x) (available in 2.6 and above). 

 If you want/have to write it yourself, use something like 

 def factorial(n):return reduce(lambda x,y:x*y,range(1,n+1))
 

 or something more readable: 

 def factorial(n):
 if n == 0:
  return 1
 else:
  return n * factorial(n-1)
 

 As always, Google is your friend ;) 
 #1 Try: 

 import math
math.factorial(n)
 
 #2 You mean: 

 def fact(n):
 f = 1
 for i in range(1, n +1):
 f *= i
 return f 
 #3 http://www.google.com/search?aq=0&amp;oq=factorial+py&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=factorial+python 

 import math
math.factorial( yourInt )
 
 #4 If you are using Python2.5 or older try 

 from operator import mul
def factorial(n):
 return reduce(mul, range(1,n+1))
 

 for newer Python, there is factorial in the math module as given in other answers here 
 #5 Existing solution 

 The shortest and probably the fastest solution is: 

 from math import factorial
print factorial(1000)
 

 Building your own 

 You can also build your own solution. Generally you have two approaches. The one that suits me best is: 

 from itertools import imap
def factorial(x):
 return reduce(long.__mul__, imap(long, xrange(1, x + 1)))

print factorial(1000)
 

 (it works also for bigger numbers, when the result becomes long ) 

 The second way of achieving the same is: 

 def factorial(x):
 result = 1
 for i in xrange(1, x + 1):
  result *= i
 return result

print factorial(1000)
