Question (ID-1614898): Running Python from the Windows Command Line How do I run a Python file from the Windows Command Line ( cmd.exe ) so that I won't have to re-enter the code each time? 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 Wouldn't you simply save your Python code into a file, and then execute that file using Python? 

 Save your code into a file called Test.py . 

 And then run it? 

 $ C:\Python24\Python.exe C:\Temp\Test.py
 
 #1 If you don't want to install an IDE, you can also use IDLE which includes a Python editor and a console to test things out, this is part of the standard installation. 

 If you installed the python.org version, you will see an IDLE (Python GUI) in your start menu. I would recommend adding it to your Quick Launch or your desktop - whatever you are most familiar with. Then right-click on the shortcut you have created and change the "Start in" directory to your project directory or a place you can mess with, not the installation directory which is the default place and probably a bad idea. 

 When you double-click the shortcut it will launch IDLE, a console in which you can type in Python command and have history, completion, colours and so on. You can also start an editor to create a program file (like mentioned in the other posts). There is even a debugger. 

 If you saved your application in "test.py", you can start it from the editor itself. Or from the console with execfile("test.py") , import test (if that is a module), or finally from the debugger. 
 #2 If you put the Python executable (python.exe) on your path, you can invoke your script using python script.py where script.py is the Python file that you want to execute. 
 #3 A good tool to have is the IPython shell . Not only can it run your program (%run command), but it offers also many tools for using Python interactively in an efficient manner (automatic completion, syntax coloring, quick access to the documentation, good interaction with Matplotlib,â€¦). After you install it, you'll have access to its shell in the Start menu. 
 #4 Open a command prompt, by pressing Win+R and writing cmd in that , navigate to the script directory , and write : python script.py 
 #5 In DOS you can use edit to create/modify text files, then execute them by typing python [yourfile] 
 #6 You need to create environment variables. Follow the instructions here: http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/articles/command_line.shtml#environment-variables
