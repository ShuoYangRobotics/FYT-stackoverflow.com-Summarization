Question (ID-3199447): Python Beginner - Slice Question Well I am practicing slicing and want to run a program that prints a name backwards. 

 Mainly, I want to know how to access the last item in the sequence. 

 I wrote the following: 

 name = raw_input("Enter Your Name: ")
backname = ???

print backname
 

 Does this look sound? Obviously, the ??? are not apart of my syntax, just asking what should go there. Thanks ahead of time! 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 backname[-1] #the last item in the sequence

 #To reverse backname (the long way):
aList = [c for c in backname] #will give you ['1', '2', ..., 'n']
aList.reverse()    #aList will be ['n', ..., '2', '1] 
backname = "".join(aList)  #backname reversed

 #To reverse backname, as other answers replied:
 backname[::-1]
 
 #1 To access the last item in a sequence, use: 

 print name[-1]
 

 This is the same as: 

 print name[len(name) - 1]
 

 Reversing a sequence has a common idiom in Python: 

 backname = name[::-1]
 

 The Good primer for Python slice notation question has more complete information. 
 #2 You want name[::-1] . The -1 is the "step" of the slice-- if you wanted every other letter, for example, you would use name[::2] . 
 #3 You can use negative indices to access items counting from the end of a list, so name[-1] will give you the last character. However, the third slice argument is a step, which can also be negative, so this will give you the whole string in reverse: 

 name[::-1]
 
 #4 With slice syntax, you would use: 

 backname = name[::-1]
 

 The two colons show that the first two parameters to the slice are left at their defaults, so start at the beginning, process to the end, but step backwards (the -1). 
 #5 You probably want to read the docs:
 http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-str-unicode-list-tuple-buffer-xrange 

 There's a method to reverse the string for you, if you want. For the specific question you asked, to access the last item of a sequence you use "seq[-1]". 
 #6 It does look sound. And your second line should be 

 backname = name[::-1]
