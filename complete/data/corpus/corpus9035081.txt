Question (ID-9035081): Python - Extracting a character from an integer I'm trying to make an algorithm in python that asks you to insert a number and then it prints the hundreds, dozens and units from the number inserted. 

 What I was thinking to do is to extract the character from the number that corresponds to the hundreds and print it as hundreds, as well with the dozens and units. 

 For instance, what I've tried to do so far was: 

 number = 321 
print 'Hundreds: ', number[1]
 

 However, when I tried to run that, I got the message: 

 TypeError: 'int' object is not subscriptable
 

 Is it impossible to do what I want? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Try str(number)[1] . You first have to convert the number to a string. 

 Note that this is not the most elegant solution. You might want to try (number // 100)%10 instead. Therefore, number has to be an int . The // denotes integer division. 
 #1 Change 

 number = 321
 

 to 

 number = str(321)
 
 #2 You have to make it a string first, try... 

 str(number)[1] 
 #3 Try print 'Hundreds:', str(number)[-3] if number &gt;= 100 else '0' 
 #4 print 'Hundereds: ', str(number // 100)[-1]
print 'Tens: ', str(number // 10)[-1]
print 'Ones: ', str(number)[-1]
 
 #5 You should convert the integer into a string before: 

 number = 321
s = str(number)
hundreds = s[0]
