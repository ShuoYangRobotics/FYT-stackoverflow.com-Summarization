Question (ID-900420): Elegant way to compare sequences Does python provide an elegant way to check for "equality" of sequences of different types? The following work, but they seem rather ugly and verbose for python code: 

 def comp1(a, b):
 if len(a) != len(b):
  return False
 for i, v in enumerate(a):
  if v != b[i]:
   return False
 return True
 

 The following is a bit shorter, but also less efficient since a third sequence is created: 

 def comp2(a, b):
 for l, r in map(None, a, b):
  if l != r:
   return False
 return True
 

 Shoehorning one of those examples into a list comprehension isn't really what I'm looking for either. 

 Edit: Ideally I am looking for a solution that doesn't create another sequence during the comparison. 
 Answers (Total-8): #0 Convert both sequences to lists, and use builtin list comparison. It should be sufficient, unless your sequences are really large. 

 list(a) == list(b)
 

 Edit: 

 Testing done by schickb shows that using tuples is slightly faster: 

 tuple(a) == tuple(b)
 
 #1 You can determine the equality of any two iterables (strings, tuples, lists, even custom sequences) without creating and storing duplicate lists by using the following: 

 all(x == y for x, y in itertools.izip_longest(a, b))
 

 Note that if the two iterables are not the same length, the shorter one will be padded with None s. In other words, it will consider [1, 2, None] to be equal to (1, 2) . 

 Edit: As Kamil points out in the comments, izip_longest is only available in Python 2.6. However, the docs for the function also provide an alternate implementation which should work all the way back to 2.3. 

 Edit 2: After testing on a few different machines, it looks like this is only faster than list(a) == list(b) in certain circumstances, which I can't isolate. Most of the time, it takes about seven times as long. However, I also found tuple(a) == tuple(b) to be consistently at least twice as fast as the list version. 
 #2 It looks like tuple(a) == tuple(b) is the best overall choice. Or perhaps tuple comparison with a preceding len check if they'll often be different lengths. This does create extra lists, but hopefully not an issue except for really huge lists. Here is my comparison of the various alternatives suggested: 

 import timeit

tests = (
'''
a=b=[5]*100
''',

'''
a=[5]*100
b=[5]*3
''',

'''
a=b=(5,)*100
''',

'''
a=b="This on is a string" * 5
''',

'''
import array
a=b=array.array('B', "This on is a string" * 5)
'''
)

common = '''import itertools
def comp1(a, b):
 if len(a) != len(b):
  return False
 for i, v in enumerate(a):
  if v != b[i]:
   return False
 return True'''

for i, setup in enumerate(tests):
 t1 = timeit.Timer("comp1(a, b)", setup + common)
 t2 = timeit.Timer("all(x == y for x, y in itertools.izip_longest(a, b))", setup + common)
 t3 = timeit.Timer("all([x == y for x, y in itertools.izip_longest(a, b)])", setup + common)
 t4 = timeit.Timer("list(a) == list(b)", setup + common)
 t5 = timeit.Timer("tuple(a) == tuple(b)", setup + common)

 print '==test %d==' % i
 print ' comp1: %g' % t1.timeit()
 print ' all gen: %g' % t2.timeit()
 print 'all list: %g' % t3.timeit()
 print ' list: %g' % t4.timeit()
 print ' tuple: %g\n' % t5.timeit()
 

 Here are the results: 

 ==test 0==
 comp1: 27.8089
 all gen: 31.1406
all list: 29.4887
 list: 3.58438
 tuple: 3.25859

==test 1==
 comp1: 0.833313
 all gen: 3.8026
all list: 33.5288
 list: 1.90453
 tuple: 1.74985

==test 2==
 comp1: 30.606
 all gen: 31.4755
all list: 29.5637
 list: 3.56635
 tuple: 1.60032

==test 3==
 comp1: 33.3725
 all gen: 35.3699
all list: 34.2619
 list: 10.2443
 tuple: 10.1124

==test 4==
 comp1: 31.7014
 all gen: 32.0051
all list: 31.0664
 list: 8.35031
 tuple: 8.16301
 

 Edit: Added a few more tests. This was run on an AMD 939 3800+ with 2GB of ram. Linux 32bit, Python 2.6.2 
 #3 Since you put the word "equality" in quotes, I assume that you would like to know how the lists are the same and how the are different. Check out difflib which has a SequenceMatcher class: 

  sm = difflib.SequenceMatcher(None, a, b)
 for opcode in sm.get_opcodes():
  print " (%s %d:%d %d:%d)" % opcode
 

 You will get back a sequences of descriptions of the differences. It's fairly simple to turn that into diff -like output. 
 #4 Apart from the extra memory used by creating temporary lists/tuples, those answers will lose out to short circuiting generator solutions for large sequences when the inequality occurs early in the sequences 

 from itertools import starmap, izip
from operator import eq
all(starmap(eq, izip(x,y)))
 

 or more concisely 

 from itertools import imap
from operator import eq
all(imap(eq, x, y))
 

 some benchmarks from ipython 

 x=range(1000)
y=range(1000);y[10]=0

timeit tuple(x)==tuple(y)
100000 loops, best of 3: 16.9 us per loop

timeit all(imap(eq,x,y))
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.86 us per loop
 
 #5 There's always: 

 list(a) == list(b)
 
 #6 It's probably not as efficient, but it looks funky: 

 def cmpLists(a, b):
 return len(a) == len(b) and (False not in [a[i] == b[i] for i in range(0,len(a)])
 

 I don't know the "all" function that Ben mentioned , but perhaps you could use that instead of "False not in" 
 #7 This "functional" code should be fast and generic enough for all purposes. 

 # python 2.6 â‰¤ x &lt; 3.0
import operator, itertools as it

def seq_cmp(seqa, seqb):
 return all(it.starmap(operator.eq, it.izip_longest(seqa, seqb)))
 

 If on Python 2.5, use the definition for izip_longest from there .
