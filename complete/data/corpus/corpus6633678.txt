Question (ID-6633678): Finding words after keyword in python Hi i am very new to python and very new to regex, so i would appreciate your patience and understanding. So here is my issue: 

 I want to find words that appear after a keyword(specified and searched by me) and print out the result. I know that i am suppose to use regex to do it, and i tried it out too, like this: 

 import re
s = "hi my name is ryan, and i am new to python and would like to learn more"
m = re.search("^name: (\w+)", s)
print m.groups()
 

 The output is just: 

 "is"
 

 But i want to get all the words and punctuations that comes after the word "name".
could someone help me out with this? 

 Any help would be largely appreciated. Thanks you very much. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Instead of using regexes you could just (for example) separate your string with str.partition(separator) like this: 

 mystring = "hi my name is ryan, and i am new to python and would like to learn more"
keyword = 'name'
befor_keyowrd, keyword, after_keyword = mystring.partition('keyword')
# before_keyword = 'hi my '
# keyword = name
# after_keyword = ' is ryan, and i am new to python and would like to learn more'
 

 You have to deal with the needless whitespaces separately, though. 
 #1 Instead of "^name: (\w+)" use: 

 "^name:(.*)"
 
 #2 You could simply do 

 s = "hi my name is ryan, and i am new to python and would like to learn more" 

 s.split('name') 

 This will split your string and return a list like this ['hi my', 'is ryan, and i am new to python and would like to learn more'] 

 depending on what you want to do this may help or not. 
 #3 Your example will not work, but as I understand the idea: 

 regexp = re.compile("name(.*)$")
print regexp.search(s).group(1)
# prints " is ryan, and i am new to python and would like to learn more"
 

 This will print all after "name" and till end of the line. 
 #4 What you have used regarding your output: 

 re.search("name (\w+)", s)
 

 What you have to use ( match all ): 

 re.search("name (.*)", s)
 
 #5 An other alternative... 

  import re
 m = re.search('(?&lt;=name)(.*)', s)
 print m.groups()
