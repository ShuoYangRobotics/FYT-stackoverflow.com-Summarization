Question (ID-1540177): How to print the function name as a string in Python def applejuice(q):
 print THE FUNCTION NAME!
 

 It should result in "applejuice" as a string. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 import traceback

def applejuice(q):
 stack = traceback.extract_stack()
 (filename, line, procname, text) = stack[-1]
 print procname
 

 I assume this is used for debugging, so you might want to look into the other procedures offered by the traceback module . They'll let you print the entire call stack, exception traces, etc. 
 #1 You need to explain what your problem is. Because the answer to your question is: 

 print "applejuice"
 
 #2 def applejuice(**args):
 print "Running the fucntion 'applejuice'"
 pass
 

 or use: 

 myfunc.__name__

&gt;&gt;&gt; print applejuice.__name__
'applejuice'
 

 Also, see how-to-get-the-function-name-as-string-in-python 
 #3 This also works: 

 import sys

def applejuice(q):
 func_name = sys._getframe().f_code.co_name
 print func_name
 
 #4 Another way 

 import inspect 
def applejuice(q):
 print inspect.getframeinfo(inspect.currentframe())[2]
 
 #5 What should it print in this case : 

 def applejuice():
  print "thefunctionname"
orangejuice = applejuice
del applejuice
orangejuice()
