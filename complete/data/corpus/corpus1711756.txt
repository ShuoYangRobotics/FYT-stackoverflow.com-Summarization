Question (ID-1711756): Python: "Indentation Error: unindent does not match any outer indentation level" I just can't figure out what's wrong with this...

 I get the following every time:

Indentation Error: unindent does not match any outer indentation level
 
 Answers (Total-8): #0 It's possible that you have mixed tabs and spaces in your file. You can have python help check for such errors with 

 python -m tabnanny &lt;name of python file&gt;
 
 #1 You probably have a mixture of spaces and tabs in your original source file. Replace all the tabs with four spaces (or vice versa) and you should see the problem straight away. 

 Your code as pasted into your question doesn't have this problem, but I guess your editor (or your web browser, or Stack Overflow itself...) could have done the tabs-to-spaces conversion without your knowledge. 
 #2 Can you set your text editor to use spaces for tabs and see if that makes anything obvious? 
 #3 Maybe it's this part: 

 if speed  &gt; self.buginfo["maxspeed"]: self.buginfo["maxspeed"] = speed
if generation &gt; self.buginfo["maxgen"] : self.buginfo["maxgen"] = generation
 

 Try to remove the extra space to make it look aligned. 

 Edit: from pep8 

 
 Yes:

  x = 1
  y = 2
  long_variable = 3

 No:

  x    = 1
  y    = 2
  long_variable = 3
 
 

 Try to follow that coding style. 
 #4 I would recommend checking your indentation levels all the way through. Make sure that you are using either tabs all the way or spaces all the way, with no mixture. I have had odd indentation problems in the past which have been caused by a mixture. 
 #5 Don't forget the use of """ comments. These need precise indentation too (a 1/2 hr job for me resolving this damn error too!) 
 #6 Sorry I can't add comments as my reputation is not high enough :-/, so this will have to be an answer. 

 As several have commented, the code you have posted contains several (5) syntax errors (twice = instead of == and three ':' missing). 

 Once the syntax errors corrected I do not have any issue, be it indentation or else; of course it's impossible to see if you have mixed tabs and spaces as somebody else has suggested, which is likely your problem. 

 But the real point I wanted to underline is that:
tabnanny IS NOT REALIABLE: you might be getting an 'indentation' error when it's actually just a syntax error. 

 Eg. I got it when I had added one closed parenthesis more than necessary ;-) 

 i += [func(a, b, [c] if True else None))]
 

 would provoke a warning from tabnanny for the next line. 

 Hope this helps! 
 #7 I am using gedit basic version that comes with Ubuntu 11.10.
I had the same error.
This is mainly caused when you mix spaces with tabs. 

 A good way to differentiate as to which lines have problem would be to go to:
1. edit
2. preferences
3. editor
4. check "automatic indentation"
5. increase the indentation to 12 or some big number 

 after doing the fifth step you will be able to see the lines of your code that are relly causing problem (these are the lines that have a mix of space and tab) 

 Make the entire code convention as just TAB or just SPACE (this has to be done manually line by line) 

 Hope this helps...
