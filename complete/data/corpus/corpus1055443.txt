Question (ID-1055443): How do I find out what Python libraries are installed on my Mac? I'm just starting out with Python, and have found out that I can import various libraries. How do I find out what libraries exist on my Mac that I can import? How do I find out what functions they include? 

 I seem to remember using some web server type thing to browse through local help files, but I may have imagined that! 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 From the Python REPL (the command-line interpreter / Read-Eval-Print-Loop), type help("modules") to see a list of all your available libs. 

 Then to see functions within a module, do help("posix") , for example. If you haven't import ed the library yet, you have to put quotes around the library's name. 
 #1 Every standard python distribution has these libraries, which cover most of what you will need in a project. 

 In case you need to find out if a library exists at runtime, you do it like this 

 try:
 import ObscureModule
except ImportError:
 print "you need to install ObscureModule"
 sys.exit(1) # or something like that
 
 #2 On Leopard, depending on the python package you're using and the version number, the modules can be found in /Library/Python: 

 /Library/Python/2.5/site-packages 

 or in /Library/Frameworks 

 /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/lib/python2.6/site-packages 

 (it could also be 3.0 or whatever version)...
I guess it is quite the same with Tiger 
 #3 You can install another library: yolk. 

 yolk is a python package manager and will show you everything you have added via pypi. But it will also show you site-packages added through whatever local package manager you run. 
 #4 For the web server, you can run the pydoc module that is included in the python distribution as a script: 

 python /path/to/pydoc.py -p 1234
 

 where 1234 is the port you want the server to run at. You can then visit http://localhost:1234/ and browse the documentation. 
 #5 just run the Python interpeter and type the command
import "lib_name" 
if it gives an error, you don't have the lib installed...else you are good to go
