Question (ID-1531551): How to yank entire block in vim? Is it possible to yank an entire block of python code in vim? be it a def, for, if, etc. block.. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 You can yank a paragraph with y}. This will not yank all the method if you have blank line though. 
 #1 There's a vim add-on script python_fn.vim which has, as one of its functions, a key binding to visually select a block of Python code using ]v . You could then yank it with y as normal. 
 #2 I usually just use visual block mode. Shift-V, move, and 'y'ank the highlighted block. There's only so many shortcuts I can keep in memory at once :) 
 #3 You can combine a search with yank, so if your function ends with return retval you can type y/return retval 
 #4 
 Enter visual line selection by pressing 'V' 
 When finished selecting the block pres 'y' 
 Paste it somewhere with 'p' or 'P' 
 
 #5 If you want to yank everything except the { use yi{ (or yi} ). If you to include the curly braces use ya{ (or ya} ). 

 The i and a modifiers mean in and all . 

 To yank a word no matter where in the word you are: yiw 

 To yank the contents of parentheses: yi) ; if you want to include them, use ya( 

 You can do the same for " or ' with yi" , ya" or yi' and ya' . 

 Of course, you're not limited to yanking. You can delete a word with diw or change it with ciw , etc... etc...
