Question (ID-6380290): Python: if error raised i want to stay in script I'm doing some practice problems from online with python and I have a question about how to stay in a script if an error is raised. For example, I want to read in values from prompt and compare them to a set integer value inside the script. The only problem is that when someone enters something other than a number 'int(value)' (ex. value = 'fs') raises an error and exits the script. I want to have it so if this happens I stay inside the script and ask for another value to be entered at the prompt. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Ah, you just want to catch the error (as long as it isn't final): see http://docs.python.org/tutorial/errors.html for details? Or are you looking for something else? 
 #1 Use try/except . 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; while True:
...  try:
...   x = int(raw_input("Please enter a number: "))
...   break
...  except ValueError:
...   print "Oops! That was no valid number. Try again..."
...
 
 #2 for this, you use try... except as explained in the python documentation 
 #3 Read up on the try: except: idiom here 
 #4 How about catching it? 

 try:
 a = int('aaa')
except ValueError:
 print('Still working')
 
 #5 success = false
while not success:
 try:
  value = raw_input('please enter an integer')
  int(value)
  success = true
 except:
  pass
