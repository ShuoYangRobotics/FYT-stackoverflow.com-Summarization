Question (ID-276052): How to get current CPU and RAM usage in Python? What's your preferred way of getting current system status (current CPU, RAM, free disk space, etc.) in Python? Bonus points for *nix and Windows platforms. 

 There seems to be a few possible ways of extracting that from my search: 

 
 Using a library such as PSI ( http://www.psychofx.com/psi/trac/wiki/ -- that currently seems not actively developed and not supported on multiple platform) or something like pystatgrab ( http://www.i-scream.org/pystatgrab/ -- again no activity since 2007 it seems and no support for Windows) 
 Using platform specific code such as using a os.popen("ps") or similar for the *nix systems and MEMORYSTATUS in ctypes.windll.kernel32 (see http://code.activestate.com/recipes/511491/ ) for the Windows platform. One could put a Python class together with all those code snippets. 
 

 It's not that those methods are bad but is there already a well-supported, multi-platform way of doing the same thing? 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 The psutil library will give you some system information (CPU / Memory usage) on a variety of platforms: 

 
 psutil is a module providing an interface for retrieving information on running processes and system utilization (CPU, memory) in a portable way by using Python, implementing many functionalities offered by tools like ps, top and Windows task manager. 
 
 It currently supports Linux, OS X, FreeBSD and Windows with Python versions from 2.4 to 3.1 by using a unique code base. 
 
 #1 Here's a class for memory usage on UNIX machines: 

 """Simple module for getting amount of memory used by a specified user's
processes on a UNIX system.
It uses UNIX ps utility to get the memory usage for a specified username and
pipe it to awk for summing up per application memory usage and return the total.
Python's Popen() from subprocess module is used for spawning ps and awk.

"""

import subprocess

class MemoryMonitor(object):

 def __init__(self, username):
  """Create new MemoryMonitor instance."""
  self.username = username

 def usage(self):
  """Return int containing memory used by user's processes."""
  self.process = subprocess.Popen("ps -u %s -o rss | awk '{sum+=$1} END {print sum}'" % self.username,
          shell=True,
          stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
          )
  self.stdout_list = self.process.communicate()[0].split('\n')
  return int(self.stdout_list[0])
 

 And here's an example of usage: 

 from memorymonitor import MemoryMonitor

memory_mon = MemoryMonitor('username')
used_memory = memory_mon.usage()
 

 If you want to get memory usage for all users you can easily modify this. 
 #2 Here's something I put together a while ago, it's windows only but may help you get part of what you need done.

  I'm not using it here because the current method covers my needs, but if someday it's needed to extend or improve this, then may want to investigate the WMI tools a vailable.

 Refer to the self.supported_types keys for the currently supported 'Performance Objects'

 To add logging support for other data you can derive the necessary data from perfmon:
 ---------
 perfmon can be run from windows 'run' menu by entering 'perfmon' and enter.
 Clicking on the '+' will open the 'add counters' menu,
 From the 'Add Counters' dialog, the 'Performance object' is the self.support_types key.
 --&gt; Where spaces are removed and symbols are entered as text (Ex. # == Number, % == Percent)
 For the items you wish to log add the proper attribute name in the list in the self.supported_types dictionary,
 keyed by the 'Performance Object' name as mentioned above.

 #3 I tried psutil from http://code.google.com/p/psutil/ and found it really helpful. 
 #4 All things about logical disks you can get using win32com module, code example here . I'm sure that this module can give you all info about machine. 
 #5 I don't believe that there is a well-supported multi-platform library available. Remember that Python itself is written in C so any library is simply going to make a smart decision about which OS-specific code snippet to run, as you suggested above. 
 #6 "... current system status (current CPU, RAM, free disk space, etc.)" And "*nix and Windows platforms" can be a difficult combination to achieve. 

 The operating systems are fundamentally different in the way they manage these resources. Indeed, they differ in core concepts like defining what counts as system and what counts as application time. 

 "Free disk space"? What counts as "disk space?" All partitions of all devices? What about foreign partitions in a multi-boot environment? 

 I don't think there's a clear enough consensus between Windows and *nix that makes this possible. Indeed, there may not even be any consensus between the various operating systems called Windows. Is there a single Windows API that works for both XP and Vista?
