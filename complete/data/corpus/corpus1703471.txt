Question (ID-1703471): Basic Python loop question - problem reading a list from a text file I'm trying to read a list of items from a text file and format with square brackets and separators like this: ['item1','item2', .... 'last_item'] but I'm having trouble with the beginning and end item for which I always get: ...,'last_item','], so I do not want the last ,' to be there. 

 In python I've write: 

 out_list = "['"
for line in open(file_in): 
	out_list += line    #append the item to the list
	out_accession_list += "','"  #add the separator
out_accession_list += "]"   #add the final closed bracket
return out_list
 

 I realize that this is a basic loop question, but I can't think of the best way to do it. Should I use a try final statement, should it be a while loop, or should I count the number of lines first and then use a loop with a range? 

 Help much appreciated. 

 Thanks, 
John 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Read in all your lines and use the string.join() method to join them together. 

 lines = open(file_in).readlines()

out_list = "['" + "','".join(lines) + "']"
 

 Additionally, join() can take any sequence, so reading the lines isn't necessary. The above code can be simplified as: 

 out_list = "['" + "','".join(open(file_in)) + "']"
 
 #1 out_list = []
for line in open(file_in):
 out_list.append("'" + line + "'")
return "[" + ",".join(out_list) + "]"
 
 #2 You "right strip" for "," the result before adding the last "]". 

 e.g. use the string.rstrip(",") 
 #3 Or 

 result = "['"
for line in open(file_in):
 if len(result) &gt; 0:
  result += "','" 
 result += line
result += "']"
return result
 
 #4 Your desired output format is exactly Python's standard printable representation of a list. So an easy solution is to read the file, create a list with each line as a string element (stripping the end-of-line of each), and call the Python built-in function repr to produce a string representation of the list: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; repr([line.rstrip() for line in open(file_in)])
"['item1', 'item2', 'item3']"
 
 #5 def do(filepath):
 out = []
 for line in open(filepath, 'r'):
  out.append("'" + line.strip() + "'")
 return out.__str__()
