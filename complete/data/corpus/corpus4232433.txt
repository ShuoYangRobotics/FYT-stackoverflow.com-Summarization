Question (ID-4232433): How to create a List given a variable "x" in Python? Python: 

 I have a variable say x.
I need to create a list of name "x" 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Use a dict. 

 mylists = {}

x = 'abhishek'
mylists[x] = []
 

 That way, in mylists you'll have all your lists. mylists[x] is the list with name x . 
 #1 x = [None, 0, 1, 42, 666, "Donald Duck", 3.14159, fractions.Fraction(355, 113)]
 
 #2 Then just do it: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; x = 42
&gt;&gt;&gt; x
42
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = [x]
&gt;&gt;&gt; x
[42]
 
 #3 This is how I interpreted your question: 

 def make_list(method):
 return [method.__name__]

def x():
 pass

make_list(x)
# ["x"]
 

 Of course you can also accept a variable number of methods and return the names of each of them in a list: 

 def make_list_of_names(*methods):
 return [m.__name__ for m in methods]

make_list(x, str, any_function)
# ["x", "str", "any_function"]
 
 #4 x = 'temp'
setattr(self,x,[])
getattr(self,x)
# gives []
 
 #5 He wants to make a variable out of a string! 
This is my interpretation of what the OP wants... 

 x = 'cat' 
*[insert magical code]* 
cat = []
 

 (I think Sudhir came the closest, excepting Nosklos clever approach) 
Here's a tad elaboration of Sudhirs. 

 class NewVariables:
 pass
x = "new_variable_name"
setattr(NewVariables, x, [ ])
 

 Tadah! 

 &gt;&gt;&gt;NewVariables.new_variable_name
[ ]
