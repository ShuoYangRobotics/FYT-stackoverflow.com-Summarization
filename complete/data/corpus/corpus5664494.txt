Question (ID-5664494): Letter Count Dictionary My homework problem is to write a Python function called LetterCount() which takes a string as an argument and returns a dictionary of letter counts. However, my code includes white space and commas as a part of the dictionary which i don't want.
Can you please help me out. How do i remove the white space from my list? Here is my code? 

 import string
def LetterCount(str):
 str= str.lower().strip()
 str = str.strip(string.punctuation)
 list1=list(str)
 lcDict= {}
 for l in list1:
  if l in lcDict:
   lcDict[l] +=1
  else:
   lcDict[l]= 1
 print lcDict

LetterCount("Abracadabra, Monsignor")
 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 Before you assign the count in the else branch, you should check whether l is a letter. Only assign the count if it is a letter. 
 #1 From python doc (note the leading and trailing aspect): 

 
 string.strip(s[, chars]) Return a copy
 of the string with leading and
 trailing characters removed. If chars
 is omitted or None, whitespace
 characters are removed. If given and
 not None, chars must be a string; the
 characters in the string will be
 stripped from the both ends of the
 string this method is called on. 
 
 Changed in version 2.2.3: The chars
 parameter was added. The chars
 parameter cannot be passed in earlier
 2.2 versions. 
 

 You should take a look at str.replace() and DefaultDict :) 
 #2 You want str.translate instead of str.strip . 
 #3 You can also check if l is an alphabetic character ( if l.isalpha() ) 

 Example: 

  import string
 def LetterCount(str):
   str= str.lower().strip()
   str = str.strip(string.punctuation)
   list1=list(str)
   lcDict= {}
   for l in list1:
     if l.isalpha():
       if l in lcDict:
         lcDict[l] +=1
       else:
         lcDict[l]= 1
   print lcDict

 LetterCount("Abracadabra, Monsignor")
 
 #4 Another option is to remove all non-alphabetic characters from the string using filter() : 

 filter(str.isalpha, "Abracadabra, Monsignor")
'AbracadabraMonsignor'
 

 (Be careful using this in your code -- you shadowed the built-in str by a variable of the same name. Never call a variable str .) 
 #5 Extending python - Letter Count Dict : 

 from collections import Counter

def LetterCount(text):
 return Counter(c for c in text.lower() if c.isalpha())
 
 #6 I don't want to do your homework for you because I don't thik it will help you but I'll try to uide you in the right direction, try this out: 

 alphabet = map(chr, range(97, 123))
 

 or 

 alphabet2 = list(string.lowercase)
 

 alphabet and alphabet2 will contain all the lowercase letters in the alphabet in a list. 

 Thanks eumiro for the remainder!
