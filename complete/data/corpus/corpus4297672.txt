Question (ID-4297672): Full text search engine for Python I'm searching for a Python full text search engine. 

 I took a look at PyLucense, but I think that using a Java-based library in a Python project is not good. As I understand, Sphinx does not have a Python API. 

 Any ideas ?

 #1 
 "Sphinx does not have a Python API" 
 

 is not true. Download the release and look at sphinx/api/sphinxapi.py 

 I use it myself and I'm pretty happy with it. The documentation is for PHP only but the Python API uses the exact same names for all functions. 
 #2 I will recommend whoosh. You can easy install it ie easy_install Whoosh
It has a neat API too 
 #3 Apache Solr is Lucene-based and offers a REST/HTTP interface to its search functions, so you have no platform lock-in or language issues. IMO it is by far the best search server out there with more features than you can ever wish for and active community to support it. 
 #4 Have you tried sqlite's FTS features? You used the sqlite tag but I see no mention of sqlite in your question. 
 #5 Particularly for full text search, Solr is an excellent choice. You will have a hard time finding a more widely used and more open choice. We use Solr/Lucene at my company with a PHP web application being the client and the HTTP/REST API to let you query the index. It has as much functionality as a native PHP client would have and much more flexibility out of the box. You can perform any query/filter you choose all using the REST API. But, on top of all of that, you get an extremely performant and widely used search system with built-in replication that is constantly being improved. Strongly recommend Solr 1.4.x as your starting point.
