Question (ID-1196708): How to import python module in a shared folder? I have some python modules in a shared folder on a Windows machine. 

 The file is \mtl12366150\test\mymodule.py 

 os.path.exists tells me this path is valid. 

 I appended to sys.path the folder \mtl12366150\test (and os.path.exists tells me this path is valid). 

 When I try to import mymodule I get an error saying the module doesn't exist. 

 Is there a way to import module that are located in shared path? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Did you forget to use a raw string, or escape the backslashes, in your additional sys.path component? Remember that "\t" is a tab, whereas r"\t" or "\t" are a backslash followed by a tab. 

 In most applications you are actually better off using forward slashes rather than backslashes even for Windows paths, and most Windows APIs will accept them just fine. Otherwise, be careful to use raw strings! 

 [There is no need to add __init__.py files in the directories above a simple Python module] 
 #1 You say os.path.exists() says the path is there, but are you absolutely sure you escaped the \? Try this: 

 sys.path.append('\\mtl12366150\\tes')
 
 #2 To import a python item there needs to be a __init__.py file in each of the folder above it to show that it is a valid python package. 

 The __init__.py files can be empty, they are there just to show structure. 

 \mtl12366150
 __init__.py
 \test
 __init__.py
  \mymodule.py
 
 #3 I think I found the answer. I was using Python 2.6.1 and with Python 2.6.2 it now works. I had the same faulty behavior with python 2.5.4. 
 #4 As S.Lott said, the best approach is to set the PYTHONPATH environment variable. I don't have a windows box handy, but it would look something like this from your command prompt: 

 c:&gt; SET PYTHONPATH=c:\mtl12366150\test
c:&gt; python
&gt;&gt;&gt; import mymodule
&gt;&gt;&gt;
 
 #5 "I appended to sys.path ..." 

 Please don't. 

 Set the PYTHONPATH environment variable from outside your application.
