Question (ID-1156819): Looking for Python gui I'm looking for the right Python gui library for a program I'm writing. I'm looking for one that is:
 1. free
 2. licensed so that I can sell the product I create
 3. good looking (could you link to screen shot examples, if possible?) 

 Thank you! 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 The Python Wiki has a nice list: 

 
 GUI Programming in Python 
 

 Most of the home pages for those libraries have screen shots and samples you can run after downloading the library. 

 I've used wxPython with success and like it a fair bit. I also hear good thing about PyQT constantly. Both can be used to produce well finished products, I think. 

 Some more information on both PyQT and wxPython is available on the Python Wiki: 

 
 http://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt 
 http://wiki.python.org/moin/WxPython 
 

 Both libraries have their own license and I'm afraid I can't tell you much more about that. (I know you can get a commercial license for PyQT, but do not know the costs involved.) 
 #1 If you want it to be both free and distributable as a commercial application, then wxPython is the way to go. Although the C++ version of Qt has switched from the GPL to LGPL license, PyQT is still GPL'ed. 
 #2 wxPython is easy to learn and looks decent.
This tutorial is very complete. 

 In case you want to try something else, there's this PyQT tutorial and this PyGTK tutorial from the same site. They look pretty decent too. 
 #3 I'd definately start out with wxpython, it's easy and just uses the operating system widget styles so it looks pretty good on windows/linux/mac 
 #4 I am suprised noone has mentioned it yet, but pygtk is a strong option as well. http://www.pygtk.org . The gtk api is mature and the python bindings are written to be very "pythonic" 

 When you are looking for the gui building http://glade.gnome.org is nice as well 
 #5 Personally, I found all of python native GUI technologies quirky and limiting. 

 However, python integrates well with pretty much any technology outhere including Flash and Winforms/WPF. I am currently building a rich UIs using Python and Winforms using Python.Net as bridge technology. I found it very easy to use. It also let's me do all the GUI heavy lifting in Visual Studio keeping presenter, model and below logic in Python. 
 #6 pyglet ( http://www.pyglet.org/ ) is nice and BSD licensed, which I prefer to GPL licenses.
