Question (ID-1376976): Porting from Python to C# I´m trying to learn C#, coming from a Python/PHP background, and I´m trying to port a script from Python to getting started. 

 The script reads a text file line by line (about 150K lines), apply a list of regex until one is matched, get the named groups results and add the values as properties of a class. 

 Here´s how the data looks like (each line starting by 'No.' is the beginning of a new record):

 And how the regex looks like: 

 regexp = {
 # No.123456789 13/12/2008 560
 # No.123456789 13/12/2008 560
 # No.123456789 13/12/2008 560
 # No.123456789 560
 'number': re.compile(r'No.(?P&lt;Number&gt;[\d]{9}) +((?P&lt;Date&gt;[\d]{2}/[\d]{2}/[\d]{4}) +)?(?P&lt;Code&gt;.*)'),

 # NCL(7) 25 no no no no no ; no no no no no no; *nonono no non o nono
 # NCL(9) 25 no no no no no ; no no no no no no; *nonono no non o nono
 'ncl': re.compile(r'NCL\([\d]{1}\) (?P&lt;Ncl&gt;[\d]{2})( (?P&lt;Especification&gt;.*))?'),

 'doc': re.compile(r'C.N.P.J./C.I.C./NºINPI : (?P&lt;Document&gt;.*)'),
 'description': re.compile(r'\*(?P&lt;Description&gt;.*)'),

 ...
}
 

 Now my questions: 

 1) Can I use the same concept, applying each of a Dictionary&lt;string, Regex&gt; in each line until one is matched? 

 2) If I do, there´s a way to get a Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt; of the named groups results? (At this stage I can treat everything as a string). 

 3) If supposed I have a class like this... 

 class Record
{
 public string Number { get; set; }
 public string Date { get; set; }
 public string Code { get; set; }
 public string Ncl { get; set; }
 public string Especification { get; set; }
 public string Document { get; set; }
 public string Description { get; set; }
}
 

 ...there is a way to set the properties with the values of the named groups? 

 4) I´m totally missing the point here, trying to code in a static typed language still thinking in a dynamically typed one? If this is the case, what can I do? 

 Sorry for this somewhat lengthy question. I really tried to resume to make this shorter :-) 

 Thanks in advance. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 1., sure 

 2., see e.g. here 

 3., yep, same basic concept as 2 

 4., nah, C# is flexible enough to allow you to port your architecture over 

 Also consider studying this book as the best intro to .NET for Python programmers AND vice versa (I'm biased, having been a tech editor and being a friend of the author, but I think this is objectively defensible;-). 
 #1 
 Yes you can. 
 .Net has support for named groups. So for (?&lt;first&gt;group)(?'second'group) , the returned Match object will support named retrieval like this. You can build youself a dictionary from this object or directly pass the Match object 
 var match = Regex.Match("subject", "regex"); 
var matchedText = match.Groups("first") 
See Named Groups in .Net and Regex support in .Net 
 I think writing a Record Record.Parse(namedValueCollection) would be a way to do it 
 You write code... You learn. I find the reverse direction a bit disorienting.. Moving from dynamic to static should be relatively easier... just that you might have to write relatively more code for some routine tasks like iteration or map or select etc. 
 
 #2 Sorry this is not a specific answer, but could you use IronPython to convert your scripts to run under the CLR and then step to C#? 
 #3 If you really want to learn C#, you should demand only references and not full answers, like this one (RegEx class) , but I'm sure you can find much more information with a quick Google search too. 
 #4 What you're looking for sounds do-able. Of course you'll want to look at System.Text.RegularExpressions , specifically the Regex type there. 

 Additionally, I'm really fond of the iterator pattern for reading lines from a file: 

 public static IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; ReadLines(string path)
{
 using(var sr = new StreamReader(path))
 {
  string line;
  while ( (line = sr.ReadLine()) != null)
  {
   yield return line;
  }
 }
}
 

 You start with that base code (which you can re-use almost everywhere) and call it in this method: 

 public static IEnumerable&lt;Record&gt; ReadRecords(string path)
{
 IEnumerable&lt;Regex&gt; expresssions = new List&lt;Regex&gt;
 {
  new Regex( @"No.(?P&lt;Number&gt;[\d]{9}) +((?P&lt;Date&gt;[\d]{2}/[\d]{2}/[\d]{4}) +)?(?P&lt;Code&gt;.*)" ),
  new Regex( @"NCL\([\d]{1}\) (?P&lt;Ncl&gt;[\d]{2})( (?P&lt;Especification&gt;"), 
  new Regex( @"C.N.P.J./C.I.C./NºINPI : (?P&lt;Document&gt;.*)")
 };

 foreach ( MatchCollection matches 
  in ReadLines(path)
   .Select(s =&gt; expressions.First(e =&gt; e.IsMatch(s)).Matches(s)))
   .Where(m =&gt; m.Count &gt; 0) 
 )      
 {
  yield return Record.FromExpressionMatches(matches);
 }
}
 

 Finish it up by adding a static factory method to your Record class that accepts a MatchCollection parameter. The one thing it looks like you're missing here is that you expect to hit each of the expressions once before completing a single record. That will work a little differently. But hopefully this gives you enough to get you really going.

dic_test.add(key,value);
