Question (ID-1206793): Django ORM for desktop application Recently, I have become increasingly familiar with Django. I have a new project that I am working on that will be using Python for a desktop application. Is it possible to use the Django ORM in a desktop application? Or should I just go with something like SQLAlchemy ? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 The Django people are sensible people with a philosophy of decoupling things. So yes, in theory you should be perfectly able to use Django's ORM in a standalone application. 

 Here's one guide I found: Django ORM as a standalone component . 
 #1 I would suggest using SQLAlchemy and a declarative layer on top of it such as Elixir if you prefer a Django-like syntax. 
 #2 Yes it is. The Commonsense Computing Project at the MIT media lab does that for ConceptNet,
a semantic network. You can get the source here: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ConceptNet/4.0b3 
 #3 The peewee ORM has a declarative syntax that should be familiar to django users, and can be used as a standalone. Here are the project docs 
 #4 I would suggest another ORM for a desktop application maybe SQLAlchemy or SQLObject.
It i possible to use the django ORM but I think other ORM are a better ones if you are going to use them standalone. 
 #5 Camelot seems promising if you want to do Python desktop apps using a DB. It uses SQLAlchemy though. Haven't tried it yet.
