 For loop works on all sequences and list is a sequence. 

 for key in sequence: print key

 You should be able to combine the two tasks. 
 #1 map(dictionary.__delitem__, lst)
 
 #2 for key in list_:
 if key in dict_:
  del dict_[key]
 
 #3 I know nothing about Python, but I guess you can traverse a list and remove entries by key from the dictionary? 
 #4 newdict = dict(
 (key, value) 
 for key, value in olddict.iteritems() 
 if key in set(list_of_keys)
)
 
 #5 d = {'one':1, 'two':2, 'three':3, 'four':4}
l = ['zero', 'two', 'four', 'five']
for k in frozenset(l) &amp; frozenset(d):
 del d[k]
 
 #6 for i in lst:
 if i in d.keys():
  del(d[i])
