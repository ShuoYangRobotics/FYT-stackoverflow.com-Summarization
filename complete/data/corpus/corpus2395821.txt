Question (ID-2395821): Python: startswith any alpha character How can I use the startswith function to match any alpha character [a-zA-Z]. For example I would like to do this: 

 if line.startswith(ALPHA):
 Do Something
 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 If you want to match non-ASCII letters as well, you can do: 

 if line and line[0].isalpha():
 
 #1 This is probably the most efficient method: 

 if line != "" and line[0].isalpha():
 ...
 
 #2 You can pass a tuple to startswiths() (in Python 2.5+) to match any of its elements: 

 import string
ALPHA = string.ascii_letters
if line.startswith(tuple(ALPHA)):
 pass
 

 Of course, for this simple case, a regex test or the in operator would be more readable. 
 #3 An easy solution would be to use the python regex module: 

 import re
if re.match("^[a-zA-Z]+.*", line):
 Do Something
 
 #4 if line.startswith((chr(x) for x in range(ord('a'), ord('z')+1)+range(ord('A'), ord('Z')+1)):
 # do processsing
 pass
 
 #5 if you don't care about blanks in front of the string, 

 if line and line.lstrip()[0].isalpha():
