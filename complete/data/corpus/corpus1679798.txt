Question (ID-1679798): How to open a file with the standard application? My application prints a PDF to a temporary file. How can I open that file with the default application in Python? 

 I need a solution for 

 
 Windows 
 Linux (Ubuntu with Xfce if there's nothing more general.)

 Answers (Total-6): #0 os.startfile is only available for windows for now, but xdg-open will be available on any unix client running X. 

 if sys.platform == 'linux2':
 subprocess.call(["xdg-open", file])
else:
 os.startfile(file)
 
 #1 on windows it works with os.system('start &lt;myFile&gt;') . On Mac (I know you didn't ask...) it's os.system('open &lt;myFile&gt;') 
 #2 if linux:
 os.system('xdg-open "$file"') #works for urls too
else:
 os.system('start "$file"') #a total guess
 
 #3 Ask your favorite Application Framework for how to do this in Linux. 

 This will work on Windos and Linux as long as you use GTK: 

 import gtk
gtk.show_uri(gtk.gdk.screen_get_default(), URI, 0)
 

 where URI is the local URL to the file 
 #4 Open file using an application that your browser thinks is an appropriate one: 

 import webbrowser
webbrowser.open_new_tab(filename)
 
 #5 A small correction is necessary for NicDumZ's solution to work exactly as given. The problem is with the use of 'is' operator. A working solution is: 

 if sys.platform == 'linux2':
 subprocess.call(["xdg-open", file])
else:
 os.startfile(file)
