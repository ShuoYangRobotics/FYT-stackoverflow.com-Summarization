Question (ID-1000132): Is there a Perl or Python library for ID3 metadata? Basically, I've got a bunch of music files yoinked from my brother's iPod that retain their metadata but have those absolutely horrendous four character names the iPod seems to like storing them under. I figured I'd write a nice, quick script to just rename them as I wished, but I'm curious about any good libraries for reading ID3 metadata. I'd prefer either Perl or Python. I'm comfortable with Perl since I use it at work, whereas Python I need more practice in and it'll make my Python evangelist friends happy. 

 Anyway, shortened version: Can you name a good library/module for either Python or Perl that will allow me to easily extract ID3 metadata from a pile of mp3s? 
 Answers (Total-8): #0 CPAN Search turns up several Perl modules when you search for ID3 . The answer to almost any Perl question that starts with "Is there a library..." is to check CPAN. 
 #1 http://www.id3.org/Implementations 
 #2 here are few python libs

 #3 I've had good luck with MP3::Info . 
 #4 I think this snippet: Rename MP3 files from ID3 tags from python recipies might be helpful. It uses id3reader lib. 
 #5 Stackoverflow question Sorting Music may help.

 #6 MP3::Tag is a also great. Again, if you are looking for a Perl module, head over to search.cpan.org first. 

 use MP3::Tag;

 $mp3 = MP3::Tag-&gt;new($filename);

 # get some information about the file in the easiest way
 ($title, $track, $artist, $album, $comment, $year, $genre) = $mp3-&gt;autoinfo();
 # Or:
 $comment = $mp3-&gt;comment();
 $dedicated_to
 = $mp3-&gt;select_id3v2_frame_by_descr('COMM(fre,fra,eng,#0)[dedicated to]');

 $mp3-&gt;title_set('New title');   # Edit in-memory copy
 $mp3-&gt;select_id3v2_frame_by_descr('TALB', 'New album name'); # Edit in memory
 $mp3-&gt;select_id3v2_frame_by_descr('RBUF', $n1, $n2, $n3); # Edit in memory
 $mp3-&gt;update_tags(year =&gt; 1866);  # Edit in-memory, and commit to file
 $mp3-&gt;update_tags();     # Commit to file
 
 #7 The Python Package Index has a list of python packages matching a search for 'id3' here , the top several of which appear to be related to your needs. As with brian's answer above, the answer to any "is there a python module that..." probably starts with PyPI.
