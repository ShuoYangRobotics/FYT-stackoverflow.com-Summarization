Question (ID-561283): Where can I find a GUI designer for Python? Does anyone know of any GUI designer for python like Glade but for windows? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Glade/Gtk+ for Windows is exactly like Glade but for Windows. 
 #1 I would suggest using PyQt and the Qt-designer(WYSIWYG gui designer) for making cross platform gui apps. 

 Qt has even gone LGPL, making it even more attractive. 

 You can find PyQt at:
 http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download 
 #2 http://wxformbuilder.org 
 #3 I use PyQt ( PyQt Homepage ); it is built on the QT Toolkit ( http://www.qtsoftware.com/ ). 

 If you are deploying to Windows, it works well with the py2exe module ( py2exe ). 

 It's fairly straightforward to use, especially if you already have experience with the QT libraries. 

 Note : this was my answer to a similar question . 
 #4 I use wxGlade 
 #5 It deppends of the GUI toolkit you're using. 

 For wxPython, there is boa-constructor . It's a Delphi-like IDE.
