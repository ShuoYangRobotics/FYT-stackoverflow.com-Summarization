Nice and simple, no install needed. 
 #2 Have you checked out http://github.com/simplegeo/python-oauth2 ? 
 #3 Matthew A. Russell has written an excellent book on this, Mining the social web. Take a look at his excample source for OAuth to twitter. The code is available here, and i recommend his book also, covering not only twitter, but facebook and linkedin aswell. 

 The code is found here: OAuth to twitter and collect friends id's 

 Good Luck 
 #4 Here is a simple twitter oauth example I wrote as a blog sometime ago. Hope this helps. 
 #5 If you're refering to http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/ .. 

 On that page it is documented as 

 
 
  
  
   api = twitter.Api(consumer_key='consumer_key', consumer_secret='consumer_secret', access_token_key='access_token',
  access_token_secret='access_token_secret') 
  
  
 
 
 To see if your credentials
 are successful: 
 
 
  
  
   print api.VerifyCredentials() {"id": 16133, "location": "Philadelphia", "name": "bear"} 
  
  
 
 

 That works. Ofcourse, your consumer key should never be human-readable in your application. But it would work even if it was.
