Question (ID-6416432): Simplifying an Expression in Python I feel there must be a simpler/cleaner/faster (choose one or more) way to write this expression... 

 take a BigString = "This is a long sentence about a red cat named dude." 

 and LittleStringList = [ "red dog", "red cat", "red mouse" ] 

 I effectively want a function/expression that returns true when one of LittleStringList is in BigString. I wrote it like this: 

 def listcontains(list, big):
 contains = False
 for string in list:
  if string in big:
   contains = True
  else:
   pass
 return contains
 

 Any help is appreciated! Thanks. 

 edit: Fixed a small error! 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 any([s in BigString for s in LittleStringList]) 

 or even better using a generator expression - as pointed out by @GWW: 

 any(s in BigString for s in LittleStringList) 
 #1 use any(): 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; BigString = "This is a long sentence about a red cat named dude."
&gt;&gt;&gt; LittleStringList = [ "red dog", "red cat", "red mouse" ]
&gt;&gt;&gt; any([str in BigString for str in LittleStringList])
True

&gt;&gt;&gt; BigString = "This is a long sentence about a red bear named dude."
&gt;&gt;&gt; any([str in BigString for str in LittleStringList])
False
 
 #2 I assume you mean if string in big ?
Maybe then try: 

 def listcontains(list, big):
 return any([string in big for string in list])
 

 Or a version with a generator: 

 def listcontains(list, big):
 def gen():
  for s in list:
   yield s in big
 return any(gen())
 
 #3 
 You don't need to go thru whole list, return on first match 
 Do not use string as variable name, it is a module, str is a type, better word would be word . 
 Do not use list as variable name 
 You are looping on list and checking again in list , instead of big 
 

 so 

 def listcontains(words, big):
 for word in words:
  if word in big:
   return True
 return False
 
 #4 To shorten it a little you could instead write: 

 def listcontains(list, big):
 for s in list:
  if s in big:
   return True
 return False
 
 #5 any(filter(lambda x: x in BigString, LittleStringList)) 

 filter will return a list with LittleStringList words inside BigString and any will return true if filter returns a list with some occurence
