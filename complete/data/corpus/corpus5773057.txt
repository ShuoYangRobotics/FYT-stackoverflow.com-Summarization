Question (ID-5773057): A cool python script to get teen learning python excited about programming? So I'm teaching a friends son some python programming, just going through control of flow, basic data types/structures. 

 I want to go through a tutorial with him, and hopefully build something simple yet cool to get him excited about the power of python. 

 Any ideas? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Have a look at Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python from Albert Sweigart. 
It has been written for little noobs. It is available in the website of the link, but you can also buy the book if you prefer. 
There is a blog with extra material with nice games as the classic gorillas or tetris. 
 #1 yeah, 

 ths might work.. 
im currently just for fun reading some stuff on encryption, i don't know what he is into exactly, but what he might like is to use python to be able to encrypt message's and do some string manipulations. 

 something simple to demonstrate what i mean: 

 plaintext = list('ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ')
encrytedtext = list('DEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABC')

def message(text, plain, encryp):
 dictionary = dict(zip(plain, encryp))
 newmessage = ''
 for char in text:
  try:
   newmessage += dictionary[char]
  except:
   newmessage += ' '
 print text, '\nhas been encrypted to:'
 print newmessage
 

 message('SEND THE MATERIAL NOW') 

 outputs: LTFR ZIT DQZTKOQS FGV 

 not md5 strength etc, but just basic letter replacement scheme's 

 now also get random sequences and then try to crack them 

 for example: 

 “EKNHZGUKQHIN OL ZIT LEOTFET ZIQZ EKTQZTL ZIT EOHITK
LNLZTDL XLTR ZG IORT DTLLQUTL YKGD XFOFZTFRTR KTEOHOTFZL”. 

 Notice first that the most frequent cipher letter is T, probably replacing the E. 
The 3-character stretch ZIT which appears twice could very well be THE and since Z 
stands for T in that case, the word ZIQZ might be THAT. The 6th word now reads **EATE* 
whose completion CREATES appears as a good choice. At this point, these successive guesses yield
the following partial decryption scheme, 

 Alphabet: ACEHRST
 Substitution: QETIKLZ
 
 #2 A game is clearly a nice thing. Maybe Tetris or Snake-like? 

 While commandline stuff are great to learn as you don't have to worry about graphical stuff they might be boring for a kid. 
 #3 Teach him map, reduce , lambda and other simple stuff :)
 
And then show him this code to find factorial of a series of number in one line. 

 
(lambda k: reduce(int.__mul__, range(1,k+1),1))(8)
 

 He will surely get excited 
 #4 If he's into math, http://projecteuler.net/ might be worth checking out with him. 

 
 What is Project Euler? 
 
 Project Euler is a series of
 challenging mathematical/computer
 programming problems that will require
 more than just mathematical insights
 to solve. Although mathematics will
 help you arrive at elegant and
 efficient methods, the use of a
 computer and programming skills will
 be required to solve most problems. 
 
 #5 You could try using the built-in turtle module to create some fractals, such as the Koch snowflake .
