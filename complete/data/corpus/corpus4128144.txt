Question (ID-4128144): Replace string within file contents How can I open a file, Stud.txt, and then replace any occurences of "A" with "Orange"? 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 Take a look at file I/O and regular expressions in Python. 
 #1 with open("out.txt", "wt") as out:
 for line in open("Stud.txt"):
  out.write(line.replace('A', 'Orange'))
 
 #2 See http://code.google.com/intl/de-DE/edu/languages/google-python-class/regular-expressions.html . 
 #3 with open('Stud.txt','r') as f:
 newlines = []
 for line in f.readlines():
  newlines.append(line.replace('A', 'Orange'))
with open('Stud.txt', 'w') as f:
 for line in newlines:
  f.write(line)
 
 #4 Open the file, read it, replace your string, write the new string to the same file: 

 text_file = open("file.txt", "rw")
whole_thing = text_file.read()
whole_thing = whole_thing.replace("A", "Orange");
text_file.write(whole_thing);
text_file.close();
 
 #5 Something like 

 file = open('Stud.txt')
contents = file.read()
replaced_contents = contents.replace('A', 'Orange')

&lt;do stuff with the result&gt;
 
 #6 easiest way is to do it with regular expressions, assuming that you want to iterate over each line in the file (where 'A' would be stored) you do... 

 import re

input = file('C:\full_path\Stud.txt), 'r')
#when you try and write to a file with write permissions, it clears the file and writes only #what you tell it to the file. So we have to save the file first.

saved_input
for eachLine in input:
 saved_input.append(eachLine)

#now we change entries with 'A' to 'Orange'
for i in range(0, len(old):
 search = re.sub('A', 'Orange', saved_input[i])
 if search is not None:
  saved_input[i] = search
#now we open the file in write mode (clearing it) and writing saved_input back to it
input = file('C:\full_path\Stud.txt), 'w')
for each in saved_input:
 input.write(each)
