Question (ID-1598733): Python Console Website I believe that I once saw a website that is like an online Python console. Does anyone know of such a website?

 http://try-python.mired.org/ 
 

 And google have one: 

 
 http://shell.appspot.com/ 
 

 There's also Lord of the REPL's:

 #1 While not really a "console", skulpt.org runs python code client-side with no plugins or anything, which makes it a lot faster than a server-side prompt. For server side and a more traditional shell I found this: http://shell.appspot.com/ . 
 #2 IronPython (using Silverlight or Moonlight 2): http://www.trypython.org/ 
 #3 I'm just find this one http://con.appspot.com/console/ 
 #4 This one is very interesting, it has an interactive shell AND a script editing area: 

 
 Py I/O 
 
 #5 An online python editor: http://doc.pyschools.com/console .
