Question (ID-2138873): Cleanest way to get last item from Python iterator What's the best way of getting the last item from an iterator in Python 2.6? For example, say 

 my_iter = iter(range(5))
 

 What is the shortest-code / cleanest way of getting 4 from my_iter ? 

 I could do this, but it doesn't seem very efficient: 

 [x for x in my_iter][-1]
 
 Answers (Total-9): #0 item = defaultvalue
for item in my_iter:
 pass
 
 #1 Probably worth using __reversed__ if it is available 

 if hasattr(my_iter,'__reversed__'):
 last = next(reversed(my_iter))
else:
 for last in my_iter:
  pass
 
 #2 This is unlikely to be faster than the empty for loop due to the lambda, but maybe it will give someone else an idea 

 reduce(lambda x,y:y,my_iter)
 

 If the iter is empty, a TypeError is raised 
 #3 Use a deque of size 1. 

 from collections import deque

#aa is an interator
aa = iter('apple')

dd = deque(aa, maxlen=1)
last_element = dd.pop()
 
 #4 I would use reversed , except that it only takes sequences instead of iterators, which seems rather arbitrary. 

 Any way you do it, you'll have to run through the entire iterator. At maximum efficiency, if you don't need the iterator ever again, you could just trash all the values: 

 for last in my_iter:
 pass
# last is now the last item
 

 I think this is a sub-optimal solution, though. 
 #5 The question is wrong and can only lead to an answer that is complicated and inefficient. 
To get an iterator, you of course start out from something that is iterable, which will in most cases offer a more direct way of accessing the last element. 

 Once you create an iterator from an iterable you are stuck in going through the elements, because that is the only thing an iterable provides. 

 So, the most efficient and clear way is not to create the iterator in the first place but to use the native access methods of the iterable. 
 #6 As simple as: 



 max(enumerate(the_iter))[1]
 
 #7 There's this 

 list( the_iter )[-1]
 

 If the length of the iteration is truly epic -- so long that materializing the list will exhaust memory -- then you really need to rethink the design. 
 #8 See this code for something similar:

 you might use it to pick up the last item with: 

 [(last, e) for (last, e) in islast(the_iter) if last]
