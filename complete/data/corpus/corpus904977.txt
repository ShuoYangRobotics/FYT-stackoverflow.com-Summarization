 #1 You are probably going to want some type of " Cloud Computing " provider. I would suggest going with Google App Engine , as you get a free account set up pretty easily. 
 #2 Check http://www.pythonanywhere.com/ . The site is still in beta mode but looks awesome and you have have 512 Mb of space. You can also store files and sync them with dropbox. 
 #3 Check out utility mill (Sorry i cant provide a link it seems). But They have some nice features like rest api and revision control. The only catch is your script should be open source. 
 #4 rextester does that 
 #5 Google for python hosting , or set up a webserver yourself. 
 #6 I was using public svn server (dejavu). Now I am going to look for some free git server. 
 #7 Check out http://codenode.org which is best described as "Google docs combined with Mathematica Notebooks". It is an active open source project, licensed under the BSD, and supports Python very well right now. 
 #8 Do you mean online python interpreter like http://pythonfiddle.com/
