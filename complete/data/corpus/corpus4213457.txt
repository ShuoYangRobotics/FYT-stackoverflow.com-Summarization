Question (ID-4213457): best version control system for personal/home use when developing with eclipse and python/django I am working on a small django project at home. I would like to install and use a small version control system for personal use for free. I don't want to use a web service like github because I am not always connected. I would like to have the VCS server/daemon installed and use it at my home pc (windows 7). 

 I would also like it to be compatible with eclipse+pydev which I use for programming. 

 Any help would be greatly appreciated!
Thanks,
Chris 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 GIT is built in a way that you can use it 'offline': doing commit, reverting change, browsing history. 

 I don't see any advantage in your case to use SVN instead of GIT (you can host your own GIT server, no need to use github.com) 

 http://book.git-scm.com/4_setting_up_a_public_repository.html 

 There are also GIT alternatives for distributed SCM: 

 
 Mercurial 
 Bazaar 
 

 

 BTW, for my personal prototype DropBox is sufficient ;) 
 #1 I suggest using mercurial with a Bitbucket private repository. Mercurial will work just fine when you're offline, and you can push your changes to Bitbucket to access your code elsewhere (your laptop, server, etc.) later. 

 There's also mercurial plugins for eclipse. (see Mercurial Eclipse Plugin ) 
 #2 I would recommend to use Mercurial together with DropBox in order to make sure that you don't lose everything in case of crash. 

 See http://www.h4ck3r.net/2010/05/11/mercurial-hg-with-dropbox/ 

 I hope it helps 
 #3 SVN has Eclipse plugins ( Subclipse , Subversive ), I don't know for pydev though. But it is one of the most used version control system and it is free. 
 #4 If it is for personal use, thus you probably don't have to go with distributed vcs, I would definitely go with subversion (svn). It has nice plugin for eclipse: subversive. I'm using it for years.

 #5 For personal version control , I would recomend the following: 

 
 FileHamster 
 Oops! Backup 
 FolderTrack 
 

 Note: I am an author of FolderTrack. I recomend it for use with programming because it will treat a group of source files as one "work product". If you want to rewind your code to yesterday and that requires deleting 2 files, renameing 1 file, and chaning 15 more then foldertrack will do it. 

 The free license for Foldertrack is: BOS
