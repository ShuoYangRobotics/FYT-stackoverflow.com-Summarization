Question (ID-4807338): Web Interaction Using Python I have learned basics of python syntax from O'Reilly Learning Python. Now I want to learn how to interact with INTERNET using python. 

 Please recommend some book on the topic for both beginner and advance web programming using python. 

 EDIT: 

 I don't want django, I want to learn how make automated http query to site, downloading web page,libcurl like in php, sql injection, bots programming and stuffs that a browser can do etc etc. 

 EDIT: 

 I don't want to study a specific module, I want a complete book on web programming, which teaches the basics of it. 

 EDIT: 

 I am not learning it to hack into someones system or server.I need it to participate in my a on line intrusion competition. 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 If you want to look at using a web framework, Django is great, and this book taught me a lot

 Also Django Book is great. And Free. 

 EDIT: 

 I see your edit, you don't want a web framework. For an http client in python httplib or urllib is a good module 
 #1 What is 'interaction with internet'? 

 Web development is one thing; there's plenty of frameworks. 

 Accessing web servers is another thing; research urllib2 , httplib et al., and beautifulsoup . 

 Lower-level interaction: research socket , then probably twisted . 

 But unless you state a problem, no tool can help you solve it. 
 #2 I would recommend "Dive into Python". It's well written and practical. There is a chapter on HTTP web service.

 I want to learn how make automated
 http query to site, downloading web
 page, stuffs that browseer can do. 
 

 You can use the [urllib2][1] module 
or you may be interested in programming with the socket api, you can see this book: [Foundations of Python Network Programming][2] 
 #4 I think that you may look at Mechanize library. It's better than using urllib2 to download the pages. 
 #5 For what you are asking for, start looking into urllib2 . 
 #6 (based on the OP's super vague question, comments, and edits about searching for a book.) 

 this looks like it might contain some of what you are looking for:
