Question (ID-1899412): python url fetch help - regex I have a web site where there are links like &lt;a href="http://www.example.com?read.php=123"&gt; Can anybody show me how to get all the numbers (123, in this case) in such links using python? I don't know how to construct a regex. Thanks in advance. 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 import re
re.findall("\?read\.php=(\d+)",data)
 
 #1 "If you have a problem, and decide to use regex, now you have two problems..." 

 If you are reading one particular web page and you know how it is formatted, then regex is fine - you can use S. Mark's answer. To parse a particular link, you can use Kimvai's answer. However, to get all the links from a page, you're better off using something more serious. Any regex solution you come up with will have flaws, 

 I recommend mechanize . If you notice, the Browser class there has a links method which gets you all the links in a page. It has the added benefit of being able to download the page for you =) . 
 #2 While the other answers are sort of correct, you should probably use the urllib2 library instead; 

 from urllib2 import urlparse
import re
urlre = re.compile('&lt;a[^&gt;]+href="([^"]+)"[^&gt;]*&gt;',re.IGNORECASE)
links = urlre.findall('&lt;a href="http://www.example.com?read.php=123"&gt;')
for link in links:
 url = urlparse.urlparse(link)
 s = [x.split("=") for x in url[4].split(';')]
 d = {}
 for k,v in s:
  d[k]=v
 print d["read.php"]
 

 It's not as simple as some of the above, but guaranteed to work even with more complex urls. 
 #3 This will work irrespective of how your links are formatted (e.g. if some look like &lt;a href="foo=123"/&gt; and some look like &lt;A TARGET="_blank" HREF='foo=123'/&gt; ). 

 import re
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup
soup = BeautifulSoup(html)
p = re.compile('^.*=([\d]*)$')
for a in soup.findAll('a'):
 m = p.match(a["href"])
 if m:
  print m.groups()[0]
 
 #4 /[0-9]/ 

 thats the regex sytax you want 

 for reference see

 #5 One without the need for regex 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; s='&lt;a href="http://www.example.com?read.php=123"&gt;'
&gt;&gt;&gt; for item in s.split("&gt;"):
...  if "href" in item:
...   print item[item.index("a href")+len("a href="): ]
...
"http://www.example.com?read.php=123"
 

 if you want to extract the numbers 

 item[item.index("a href")+len("a href="): ].split("=")[-1]
