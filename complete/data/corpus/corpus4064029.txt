Question (ID-4064029): Is there such a thing for Django as there is Heroku for Ruby on Rails Is there a cloud based development for Django, such as there is cloud based development and hosting environment for Ruby / heroku 
 Answers (Total-10): #0  ep.io provides WSGI hosting Heroku style. It's from Andrew Godwin of South fame. From their website: 

 
 This is ep.io, the hosted WSGI hosting and deployment solution. We take your Django, Flask, Pylons or other WSGI code, run all the annoying hosting parts for you, and make sure everything's redundant and backed up. In return, we bill you only for the processing time and bandwidth you actually use - we'll even give you detailed analytics of when and where those resources are being used. However, we're currently in a closed beta, so this is only available to those we invite 
 

 They support PostgreSQL and Redis. They have a client you download to deploy from the command line, or you can push to them via git or mercurial. They have a good amount of documentation, but I just recently started using them and haven't pushed a deployment yet so I have no idea of how well the service works yet. 

 Gondor is from the Eldarion guys (founder of the company is also founder of pinax ). They support: 

 
 
  
  revision control via git or mercurial 
  dependency management using pip 
  database migrations via South or nashvegas 
  full backups of your entire application 
  asynchronous and scheduled task execution 
  full-text search using Solr and django-haystack 
  caching via memcached or redis 
  
 
 

 From the survey they have you take when you get a beta account, it seems like they're looking to host massive traffic sites. The survey actually made me wonder how expensive the service is going to be after beta. 
 #1 Heroku itself is now for Django, too! Sort of. :) Heroku now implicitly supports Django with its new Cedar "run anything" release. See: 

 http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2612943 and
 http://news.heroku.com/news_releases/heroku-announces-major-new-version-celadon-cedar-includes-new-process-model-full-nodejs- 

 Its not automated like Rails and Node.js would be, so you'll have to be pretty smart with your configuration skills. But you if you can follow this: 

 http://www.askthepony.com/blog/2011/07/getting-django-on-heroku-prancing-8-times-faster/ 

 it should get you there and beyond. 

 Update: 

 Heroku is starting to document its support for python &amp; django.See: 

 http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2011/9/28/python_and_django/

 #2 Djangy seems to be similar. I used neither, so I can't say how similar they are. Djangy only supports MySQL as a database, which is kind of a deal breaker for me. 

 /edit: as Zolomon says, Djangy closed its doors. I'll recommend RJBrady 's answer for some serious upvoting. 
 #3 google app engine might do what you want - take a look at it here http://code.google.com/appengine/articles/django.html 
 #4 I just found out about DotCloud.com ! Seems like they will support a customizable stack! 
 #5 You could check out DjangoZoom : "turn your django code into a live, public app in five minutes" on cloud servers. You can currently request an invite for the beta version. 
 #6 I think Graham has them all here http://blog.dscpl.com.au/2011/01/awesome-year-for-python-web-hosting.html

 #8 30loops.net is another contender, still in private beta though... Seems a lot of movement is going on in the Python hosting space!
