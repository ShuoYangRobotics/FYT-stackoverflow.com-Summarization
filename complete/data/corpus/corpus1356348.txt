Question (ID-1356348): sum of two numbers coming from the command line I know it's a very basic program but I am getting an error of list out of range. Here is the program to take two numbers as command-line arguments (while invoking the script) and display sum (using python): 

 import sys
a= sys.argv[1]
b= sys.argv[2]
sum=str( a+b)
print " sum is", sum
 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 You should do this: 

 import sys
a, b = sys.argv[1:2]
summ = int(a) + int(b)
print "sum is", summ
 

 There is no need for str() when printing an integer. But you should use int() if you want to add a and b as integers. 
 #1 The error list index out of range means that you are trying to access a list item that is outside the bounds of the list. 

 Example: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; mylist = ['hello', 'world']
&gt;&gt;&gt; print mylist[2]
Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
IndexError: list index out of range
 

 In your case, the error comes from either sys.argv[1] or sys.argv[2] . 

 Make sure you actually pass something to the program from the command line. 
 #2 Assuming your inputs are integers: 

 import sys
summ = sum(map(int,sys.argv[1:])
print "sum is ", summ
 

 or 

 import sys
summ = sum(int(i) for i in sys.argv[1:])
print "sum is ", summ
 

 If not, change int to float. 

 The second method is probably more pythonic, but the first is a little faster in this instance. 

 &gt;&gt;&gt;import timeit
&gt;&gt;&gt;t1 = timeit.Timer("sum(map(int,['3','5','7','9']))")
&gt;&gt;&gt;t2 = timeit.Timer("sum(int(i) for i in ['3','5','7','9'])")
&gt;&gt;&gt;print t1.timeit()
3.0187220573425293
&gt;&gt;&gt;print t2.timeit()
3.4699549674987793
 
 #3 su = int(a) + int(b)
print("sum is %d" % su)
 

 And you should be careful with your variable naming. sum shadows the built-in, it's not a good practice to do that (that is, don't name variables as built-in functions or any globally defined name). 
 #4 If your error is "list index out of range" , then the problem is that your list doesn't have enough items. Which list? The only list you're using is sys.argv , so to populate it, you need to pass more items on the command line. 

 Alternatively, check for the length of the argument list with len(sys.argv) and prompt interactively (e.g. using raw_input() ) to get the values if they're not in sys.argv . 
 #5 If you wish to sum the numbers as floating points number use "float" instead of "int", like in the following snippet. 

 import sys
try:
 a, b = sys.argv[1:3]
 print "sum is ", float(a) + float(b)
except ValueError:
 print "please give me two numbers to sum"
 

 Beware that floating points are different from real numbers, so that you could obtain seemingly "strange" results about which there is a wealth of documentation on the web. 
 #6 Thanks to every one. I got the answer 

 for i in range (1,51):
 if i%5==0:
 	print i,"\n"
 else:
 	print i,
