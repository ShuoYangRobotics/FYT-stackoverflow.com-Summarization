Question (ID-1025817): Call program from within a browser without using a webserver Is there a way to call a program (Python script) from a local HTML page?
I have a YUI-colorpicker on that page and need to send its value to a microcontroller via rs232. (There is other stuff than the picker, so I can't code an application instead of an HTML page.) 

 Later, this will migrate to a server, but I need a fast and easy solution now. 

 Thanks. 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 I see now that Daff mentioned the simple HTTP server, but I made an example on how you'd solve your problem (using BaseHTTPServer ): 

 import BaseHTTPServer

HOST_NAME = 'localhost'
PORT_NUMBER = 1337

class MyHandler(BaseHTTPServer.BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
 def do_GET(s):
  s.send_response(200)
  s.send_header('Content-Type', 'text/html')
  s.end_headers()

  # Get parameters in query.
  params = {}
  index = s.path.rfind('?')
  if index &gt;= 0:
   parts = s.path[index + 1:].split('&amp;')
   for p in parts:
    try:
     a, b = p.split('=', 2)
     params[a] = b
    except:
     params[p] = ''

  # !!!
  # Check if there is a color parameter and send to controller...
  if 'color' in params:
   print 'Send something to controller...'
  # !!!

  s.wfile.write('&lt;pre&gt;%s&lt;/pre&gt;' % params)

if __name__ == '__main__':
 server_class = BaseHTTPServer.HTTPServer
 httpd = server_class((HOST_NAME, PORT_NUMBER), MyHandler)

 try:
  httpd.serve_forever()
 except KeyboardInterrupt:
  pass

 httpd.server_close()
 

 Now, from your JavaScript, you'd call http://localhost:1337/?color=ffaabb 
 #1 Python has a small built in Web server. If you already already got Python to run with the RS232 you might need to read here on how to set up a very simple and basic webserver.
An even easier one can look like this : 

 import SimpleHTTPServer
import SocketServer

port = 8000
Handler = SimpleHTTPServer.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler
httpd = SocketServer.TCPServer(("", port), Handler)
httpd.serve_forever()
 

 Try so separate you source as good as possible, to that you won't have too much trouble to move it to a production ready Python capable webserver. 
 #2 If you want an an HTML page to have some sort of server-side programming then you will need a webserver of some sort to do the processing. 

 My suggestion would be to get a web server running on your development box, or try to accomplish what you need to do with a local desktop application or script. 
 #3 another quick solution is https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3002
POW, it's a firefox extension that adds a simple web server with Server Side JS built in. 

 You'd be able to access a command line and call a python script from there. 
 #4 No you need some kind of server. Wh not try out the portable webservers ? You can run them from your usb drive. 
 #5 Try also XML-RPC it gives you a simple way to pass remote procedure calls from YUI towards a simple XMLRPC server and from that towards your rs232 device 
 #6 I see no reason why you can't setup a handler for .py/.bat/.vbs files in your browser. This should result in your chosen application running a script when you link to it. This won't work when you migrate to the server but as a testing platform it would work. Just remember to turn it off when you're done or you expose yourself to viruses from other sites.
