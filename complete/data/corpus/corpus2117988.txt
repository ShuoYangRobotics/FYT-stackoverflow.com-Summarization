Question (ID-2117988): What IDE to use for Google App Engine development in Python? I'm trying to figure out what IDE to use for Google App Engine development in Python. I'm completely new to Python, coming from a C#/.NET background. 

 I initially went down the route of getting the Eclipse plugin for Google App Engine development only to find out it was for Java development only. 

 Currently, I'm just using Notepad++ which, although a decent editor, I'm looking for a more full-blown IDE. Maybe it's because I'm accustomed to Visual Studio when doing .NET development, but I figure there must be something better than just using Notepad++ to edit my Python/GAE code. 
 Answers (Total-14): #0 I'd like to recommend JetBrains PyCharm http://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/PYH/JetBrains+PyCharm+Preview , which is really powerful at code refactoring and web development. 
 #1 PyDev has support for GAE projects. 
 #2 James, I am also primarily a C#/Visual Studio guy, but I have gotten deeply into AppEngine devleopment over the past couple of years. The best IDE that I have found is Wing IDE . It's not Visual Studio, but it does a remarkably good job of imitating Intellisense and providing the very powerful debugging capabilities to which Visual Studio accustoms one. 

 It's not free, but I am sure that you will find it very worth your investment. 
 #3 My workhorse IDE is Komodo Edit , Komodo IDE's free (both as in beer and as in speech) little brother. It works great with Python - automatically extracting autocomplete data from the source itself - just include the AppEngine directory and wait for it to scan the files. 

 Here's a good step-by-step guide configuring Komodo IDE for Google AppEngine development: using-komodo-edit-as-an-ide-for-google-app-engine.html 
 #4 Eclipse with pydev is ok, if you don't dabble in obscure SDKs (for some reason auto-completion seems hard to do in python, especially with precompiled python libraries). 
 #5 Actually you can use Eclipse+Python with the PyDev plugin. There is a tutorial here . 
 #6 There is Aptana Studio , although I haven't used it myself. I think it's based on Eclipse, so presumably it will use the PyDev plugin too. 
 #7 Wing IDE ( paid , but with free version ) does very good stuff for General Python and AppEngine! Give it a shot. 

 Free version doesn't support GAE debugging. 
 #8 Komodo Edit it's a good option 
 #9 Notice that if you right click the project node, you cannot see "Run as->PyDev: Google App Engine", but you can right click the src folder, it works. 
 #10 I like Eclipse+Python with the PyDev plugin but Wing IDE feels so nice when coding - i would love to look at Komodo IDE i like it for PHP . 
 #11 I can't recommend PyCharm enough. I think that this is the kind of neat and clean development experience you are looking for : http://www.basarat.com/2011/06/google-app-engine-python-pycharm-love.html I am a C# guy and I know exactly what you mean when you say Visual Studio. This is as close as it gets to the best possible experience on Google App Engine. I have tried the alternatives and I have had good python programming experiences on all of them. But for google app engine this is my bet. 
 #12 I'd like to recommend netbean 6.9 + 'python' addon. 

 Notes: At this time netbean 7.0 released but python addon not updates 
 #13 You can try appengine-emacs-toolkit. http://code.google.com/p/appengine-emacs-toolkit/ 

 This toolkit contains two emacs major mode which help to develop GoogleAppEngine and SinaAppEngine with python. 

 It provides support for create new project , launch local server , open browser to view project , upload project . 

 This toolkit tested on WindowsXP/7, Ubuntu with GoogleAppEngine-1.6.1, saepythondevguide.
