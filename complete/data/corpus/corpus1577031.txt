Question (ID-1577031): What does this function do? def fun1(a):

 for i in range(len(a)):
  a[i] = a[i] * a[i]
 return a
 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 It takes an array as parameter and returns the same array with each member squared. 

 EDIT: 

 Since you modified your question from 'What does this function do' to 'What is some code to execute this function', here is an example: 

 def fun1(a):
 for i in range(len(a)):
  a[i] = a[i] * a[i]
 return a

test1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
print 'Original list', test1
test2 = fun1(test1)
print 'Result', test2
print 'Original list', test1
 

 The output will be: 

 Original list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Result [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
Original list [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
 

 Because the function modifies the list in place, test1 is also modified. 
 #1 It will go through your List and multiply each value by itself. 

 Example 

 a = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ]
 

 After that function a would look like this: 

 a = [ 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36 ]
 
 #2 It's a trivial function that could be replaced with the one-liner: 

 a = [x*x for x in a]
 
 #3 it multiplies each element of the array "a" with itself and stores the results back in the array. 
 #4 a is passed as a list , I assume. 

 It squares each element of the list and returns the list. 
 #5 It squares every element in the input array and returns the squared array. 

 So with a = [1,2,3,4,5] 

 result is: [1,4,9,16,25]
