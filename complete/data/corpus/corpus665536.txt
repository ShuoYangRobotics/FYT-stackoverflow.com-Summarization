Question (ID-665536): How do I go about writing a program to send and receive sms using python? I have looked all over the net for a good library to use in sending and receiving sms's using python but all in vain! 

 Are there GSM libraries for python out there? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Have you looked at py-sms ? 
 #1 Python-binding for Gammu perhaps? 

 BTW. It's GUI version ( Wammu ) is written in wxPython. 
 #2 I have recently written some code for interacting with Huawei 3G USB modems in python. 

 My initial prototype used pyserial directly, and then my production code used Twisted's Serial support so I can access the modem asynchronously. 

 I found that by accessing the modem programatically using the serial port I was able to access all the functionality required to send and receive SMS messages using Hayes AT commands and extensions to the AT command set. 

 This is the one of the referneces I was able to find on the topic, it lists these commands: 

 AT+CMGL  List Messages
AT+CMGR  Read message
AT+CMGS  Send message
AT+CMGW  Write message to memory
 

 They are complicated commands and take arguments and you have to parse the results yourself. 

 There are more references on the internet you can google for that reference these 4 commands that will let you work out how your modem works. 
 #3 I provided a detailed answer to a similar question here . I mention a Python interface to an SMS gateway provided by TextMagic. 
 #4 There is this Python Lib for Nexmo, the wholesale SMS API. 
 #5 Also check PyKannel . 

 There's also a web service for sending and receiving SMS (non-free, of course), but I don't have URL at hand. :(
