Question (ID-4373428): How do I find where Python is located on Unix? I'm working on a new server for a new workplace, and I'm trying to reuse a CGI script I wrote in Python earlier this year. My CGI script starts off with 

 #!/local/usr/bin/python
 

 But when I run this on the new server, it complains that there's no such folder. Obviously Python's kept in a different place on this box, but I've got no idea where. 

 I haven't done much unix before, just enough to get around, so if there's some neat trick I should know here I'd appreciate it :) 

 Thanks!

 Update : 

 I misread. Replace your header with 

 #!/usr/bin/env python 

 This will pull in the python location from the user that runs the script's environmental settings 
 #1 For this very reason it is recommend that you change your shebang line to be more path agnostic: 

 #!/usr/bin/env python
 

 See this mailing list message for more information: 

 
 Consider the possiblities that in a different machine, python may be installed at /usr/bin/python or /bin/python in those cases, #!/usr/local/bin/python will fail.
 For those cases, we get to call the env executable with argument which will determine the arguments path by searching in the $PATH and use it correctly. 
 
 ( env is almost always located in /usr/bin/ so one need not worry that env is not present at /usr/bin .) 
 
 #2 Try: 

 which python
 

 in a terminal. 
 #3 The proper way to solve this problem is with 

 #!/usr/bin/env python
 

 which allows for the use of a binary in the PATH in a shebang. 
 #4 Try: which python or whereis python 
 #5 good idea to use backtick for header python script 

 `which python`
