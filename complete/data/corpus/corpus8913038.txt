Question (ID-8913038): How to take a number from a string using regex? How can I take the number ( 20 in the following example) in this string? 

 string = """&lt;option value="full_review"&gt;Detailed review (Up to $20.00)&lt;/option&gt;"""
 

 I used 

 detailint = re.findall("""value="full_review"&gt;Detailed review (Up to $(.*))&lt;/option&gt;""", bidsrc)
 

 But it doesn't return me a sweat! Any tricks? 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Assuming bidsrc = string , you need to escape both the $ and the () since they have a special meaning to the regex compiler. You'll also want to use .*? , or better [\d.]+ , to match the actual amount. 

 r"""value="full_review"&gt;Detailed review \(Up to \$([\d.]+)\)&lt;/option&gt;"""
 
 #1 Pretty straightforward. 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; import re
&gt;&gt;&gt; s = "Detailed review (Up to $20.00)"
&gt;&gt;&gt; re.findall("(\d+)\.",s)
['20']
 

 I'm sure you've already checked, but the python docs on the subject is very helpful. Also look into the special characters that python uses, like $ , ( , and ) . 

 To explain in more detail, in the regex above, (\d+) is the capturing group which captures 1 or more digits before a period (here, escaped as \. ). that's why it matches 20 and not 00 . 
 #2 Remember that '$' has a special meaning in regular expressions, so as '.', '(', ')', '*' and many others. You have to escape (eg. '\$') them if you don't want them to be processed specially 
 #3 Try this 

 import re
string = '&lt;option value="full_review"&gt;Detailed review (Up to $20.00)&lt;/option&gt;'
finded = re.findall("""value="full_review"&gt;Detailed review \(Up to \$([\d.].*)\)&lt;/option&gt;""",string)
print finded
 
 #4 Since ( , ) and $ are special characters in regex paterns, you need to escape them with \ in your pattern as following: 

 detailint = re.findall("""value="full_review"&gt;Detailed review \(Up to \$(.*)\)&lt;/option&gt;""", bidsrc)
 

 Another thing is using .* is not the best choice, since it will capture any character. It's much better to use [\d]+ instead, which will capture at least one number ( * is 0 or more, + is 1 or more; \d means any numeric character, and [] is character set): 

 detailint = re.findall("""value="full_review"&gt;Detailed review \(Up to \$([\d]+)\)&lt;/option&gt;""", bidsrc)

 #5 import re
s = "Detailed review (Up to $20.00)"
 re.findall("\$\d+\.\d+",s)[0][1:]
 

 Gives you 20.00 (includes decimal as well)
