Question (ID-6012641): Is there any book in Java/Python that explains how the concepts in Discrete math are used while designing programs? I am looking for a book that explains how a discrete math concept like, say, set theory, is used while doing programming. 
My preference is towards books that are easy to understand. For me, that means they use more English and less Mathematical notations and spend less time proving some theorems. I am quite comfortable with high-school mathematics and I have basic understanding of terms and concepts used in discrete mathematics (i.e. I know what a set is and how probability of two independent events occurring together is calculated, etc) 

 I can also understand languages like Haskell, Lisp, Ruby, Perl (and all C-based languages).

 I highly recommend this book. I haven't finished it yet, but it has so far been a thoroughly enjoyable experience for learning both advanced mathematics and Haskell. It is a course-style text with unanswered questions and exercises, but I emailed the author and he quickly replied with the answers in pdf format. 

 P.S. It is heavy on the mathematical notation, but I only completed Calc I (10 years ago!) and am able to work through it without too much issue.

 #2 I think this one will be useful for you: http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Thomas-H-Cormen/dp/0262033844/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1305883750&amp;sr=1-1 It's using pseudocode for explaining basic concepts of programming which you can use in any programming language you'd like. 
 #3 If I were you I wouldn't buy any book. 

 I would write a small program for each topic in discrete math. For the topic of set theory I would write a program that perform set operations like unions, intersections, difference etc. 

 A simple example, take a list of customers that have bought product p1, then a list of customers that have bought product p2. Find out which customers have bought both products and which ones have bought only one product, using set theory. 

 Come up with your own examples, it doesn't matter if they are not real life ones. 
Then, in your daily programming, when facing a new problem you will automatically realize whether you can generalize it to one of the topic in discrete (or other) math. 

 You can start with this page to browse for topics: Discrete math wikibook instead of buying a book. 
 #4 I really enjoyed reading Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications by Kenneth Rosen 

 The English is simple and easy to read, very well structured with lot of exercises. 

 You don't need advanced math to get it. 
 #5 This is one of the book I have used.
