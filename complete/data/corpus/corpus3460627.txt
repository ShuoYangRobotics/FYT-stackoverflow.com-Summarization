Question (ID-3460627): The Zen of Ruby I have written a Ruby gem named 'this'. Get it here http://rubygems.org/gems/this . Purpose of 'this' is to show quotes of 'The Zen of Ruby' whenever you "require 'this'". As I could not find any equivalent zen quotes for Ruby, currently I am using 'The Zen of Python' (PEP 20). Extremely sorry for using it :) 

 Can you guys suggest me good quotes that Ruby 'Zen' should have. I would update 'this' gem to have new quotes. 

 Thanks.

 #1 Did you write a test for that? 
 #2 "Zen of Ruby" is an oxymoron. 
 #3 'There is more than one way to do everything and this is good' 
 #4 "blocks aren't objects" 
and the corollary
"blocks are objects" 
 #5 'easy is better than simple' 
 #6 'Premature optimization is the root of all evil.'
