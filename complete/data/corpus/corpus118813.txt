Question (ID-118813): How do I uninstall python from OSX Leopard so that I can use the MacPorts version? I want to use the macports version of python instead of the one that comes with Leopard. 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 Don't. Apple ships various system utilities that rely on the system Python (and particularly the Python "framework" build); removing it will cause you problems. 

 Instead, modify your PATH environ variable in your ~/.bash_profile to put /opt/local/bin first. 
 #1 Use the python_select port to switch python interpreters. 

 sudo port install python25
sudo port install python_select
sudo python_select python25
 

 This will symlink /opt/local/bin/python to the selected version. Then export PATH as described above. 
 #2 I have both installed: 

 $ which python
/usr/bin/python
$ which python2.5
/opt/local/bin/python2.5
 

 I also added the following line to my .profile : 

 export PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH
 
 #3 python_select is now deprecated, use this instead: 

 sudo port select python python26
 
 #4 Instead of uninstalling the built-in Python, install the MacPorts version and then modify your $PATH to have the MacPorts version first. 

 For example, if MacPorts installs /usr/local/bin/python , then modify your .bashrc to include PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH at the end. 
 #5 The current Macports installer does the .profile PATH modification automatically. 
 #6 I wouldn't uninstall it since many scripts will expect python to be in the usual places when they do not follow convention and use #!/usr/bin/env python . You should simply edit your .profile or .bash_profile so the macports binaries are the first in your path. 

 Your .profile should have this line: 

 export PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH
 

 If not, add it in, and now your shell will search macport's bin/ first, and should find macports python before system python.
