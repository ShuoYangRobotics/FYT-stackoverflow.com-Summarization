Question (ID-2639582): Python : Small Regex problem when I try to extract this video ID (AIiMa2Fe-ZQ) with a regex expression, I can't get the dash an all the letters after. 

 Someone can help me please? 

 Thanks 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; id = re.search('(?&lt;=\?v\=)\w+', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIiMa2Fe-ZQ')
&gt;&gt;&gt; print id.group(0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; AIiMa2Fe
 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 Intead of \w+ use below. Word character (\w) doesn't include a dash. It only includes [a-zA-Z_0-9]. 

 [\w-]+
 
 #1 &gt;&gt;&gt; re.search('(?&lt;=v=)[\w-]+', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIiMa2Fe-ZQ').group()
'AIiMa2Fe-ZQ'
 

 \w is a short-hand for [a-zA-Z0-9_] in python2.x, you'll have to use re.A flag in py3k. You quite clearly have additional character in that videoid, i.e., hyphen. I've also removed redundant escape backslashes from the lookbehind. 
 #2 /(?:/v/|/watch\?v=|/watch#!v=)([A-Za-z0-9_-]+)/ 

 Explain the RE 

 There are three alternate YouTube formats: /v/[ID] and watch?v= and the new AJAX watch#!v= This RE captures all three. There is also new YouTube URL for user pages that is of the form /user/[user]?content={complex URI} This is not captured here by any regex... 
 #3 I don't know the pattern for youtube hashes, but just include the "-" in the possibilities as it is not considered an alpha: 

 import re
id = re.search('(?&lt;=\?v\=)[\w-]+', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIiMa2Fe-ZQ')
print id.group(0)
 

 I have edited the above because as it turns out: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; re.search("[\w|-]", "|").group(0)
'|'
 

 The "|" in the character definition does not act as a special character but does indeed match the "|" pipe. My apologies. 
 #4 Use the urlparse module instead of regex for such kind of things. 

 import urlparse

parsed_url = urlparse.urlparse(url)
if parsed_url.netloc.find('youtube.com') != -1 and parsed_url.path == '/watch':
 video = urlparse.parse_qs(parsed_url.query).get('v', None)

 if video is None:
  video = urlparse.parse_qs(parsed_url.fragment.strip('!')).get('v', None)

 if video is not None:
  print video[0]
 

 EDIT: Updated for the upcoming new youtube url format. 
 #5 I'd try this: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; import re
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = re.compile(r'.*(\-\w+)$')
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.search('http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIiMa2Fe-ZQ').group(1)
'-ZQ'
