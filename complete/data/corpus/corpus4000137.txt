Question (ID-4000137): what's the max range for colors in this format: #AABBCC? How can I convert colors from (N, N, N) format to #AABBCC (and #AAABBBCCC) ? 

 thanks 
 Answers (Total-8): #0 #FFFFFF , so simple 

 every single char has 0..F range. That is 0..15 . So two chars is 0..(16*16-1) -&gt; 0-255 

 To convert between formats just think about: 

 #AABBCC are three values AA BB CC . Every single value represents a channel (red, green, blue) that can span from 0 to 255 or from 0 to FF or from 0.0 to 1.0 

 if you have for example #123456 you can do 

 12 -&gt; 1*16 + 2 = .. (result in range 0-255)
34 -&gt; 3*16 + 4 = ..
56 -&gt; 5*16 + 6 = ..
 

 in general a two digits hex number composed by XY can be converted to an decimal value by multiplying X by 16 and adding Y , taking care of converting digits that are over 9 (A, B, C, D, E, F) to their counterparts (10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15). So for example AC would be A*16 + C = 10*16 + 12 . 

 (To be really precise a n digit hex number is converted by multiplying the i-th digit from right by 16^i and adding all of them together) 
 #1 From 00 to FF. It is hexacecimal for 0 to 255. 
 #2  RRGGBB RRGGBB
#000000 - #FFFFFF
 Black - White

RR = 00 - FF or 0 - 255
GG = 00 - FF or 0 - 255
BB = 00 - FF or 0 - 255
 
 #3 Those are hexidecimal representations of 16 bit numbers for the Red Green and Blue channels. So 0 to 255 for each channel. FF (hex) is equal to 255 decimal. 
 #4 As others have said, 00 - FF . 

 Here's an overview of HTML colors in hex notation:

 You can find out how to convert from hex to decimal here:

 And, for Python:

 Or search for " convert hex decimal " 
 #5 This is hexadecimal (base 16) notation, where each digit goes from 0 to 15 (F). 

 The range of 0 to FF in hexadecimal is 0 to 255 in decimal. 

 If you want to convert from one to another, there are plenty of sites that will do that for you - like this one . 
 #6 Using Python? Try this: 

 c = (0., 1., 0.)
rgb = '#%02X%02X%02X' % (c[0] * 255, c[1] * 255, c[2] * 255)
 
 #7 The min and max values for colors in the #AABBCC format is #000000...#FFFFFF, or 0...16777215 in decimal. Each individual color component ranges from #00..#FF, which is 0..255 in decimal and requires 8-bits or 1 byte of storage. For #AAABBBCCC the range of components is #000-#FFF or 0..4095 each and they require 12-bits or 1Â½ bytes of storage. 

 Not sure what the range of values is for N in (N, N, N), but if it's 0..1 then these two functions will convert from it to either 8-bit component #AABBCC or 12-bit component #AAABBBCCC color values (without rounding). Note that the output of each function is a string with the value shown after each print statement below. ITOH8 and ITOH12 are constant lookup tables used by the corresponding function. 

 ITOH8 = [('%02X' % i) for i in range(0x100)]

rgbconv8 = lambda c: ''.join( ['#'] + [ITOH8[int(v*0xFF)] for v in c] )

print rgbconv8((0., 1., 0.)) #00FF00
print rgbconv8((.2, .6, .75)) #3399BF

ITOH12 = [('%03X' % i) for i in range(0x1000)]

rgbconv12 = lambda c: ''.join( ['#'] + [ITOH12[int(v*0xFFF)] for v in c] )

print rgbconv12((0., 1., 0.)) #000FFF000
print rgbconv12((.2, .6, .75)) #333999BFF
