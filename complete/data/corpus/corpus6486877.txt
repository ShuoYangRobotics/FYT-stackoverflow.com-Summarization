Question (ID-6486877): Python code for the coin toss issues I've been writing a program in python that simulates 100 coin tosses and gives the total number of tosses. The problem is that I also want to print the total number of heads and tails. 

 Here's my code: 

 import random
tries = 0
while tries &lt; 100:
 tries += 1
 coin = random.randint(1, 2)
 if coin == 1:
  print('Heads')
 if coin == 2:
  print ('Tails')
total = tries
print(total)
 

 I've been racking my brain for a solution and so far I have nothing. Is there any way to get the number of heads and tails printed in addition to the total number of tosses? 
 Answers (Total-7): #0 import random

samples = [ random.randint(1, 2) for i in range(100) ]
heads = samples.count(1)
tails = samples.count(2)

for s in samples:
 msg = 'Heads' if s==1 else 'Tails'
 print msg

print "Heads count=%d, Tails count=%d" % (heads, tails)
 
 #1 You have a variable for the number of tries, which allows you to print that at the end, so just use the same approach for the number of heads and tails. Create a heads and tails variable outside the loop, increment inside the relevant if coin == X block, then print the results at the end. 
 #2 Keep a running track of the number of heads: 

 import random
tries = 0
heads = 0
while tries &lt; 100:
 tries += 1
 coin = random.randint(1, 2)
 if coin == 1:
  heads += 1
  print('Heads')
 if coin == 2:
  print ('Tails')
total = tries
print('Total heads '.format(heads))
print('Total tails '.format(tries - heads))
print(total)
 
 #3 You could use random.getrandbits() to generate all 100 random bits at once: 

 import random

N = 100
# get N random bits; convert them to binary string; pad with zeros if necessary
bits = "{1:&gt;0{0}}".format(N, bin(random.getrandbits(N))[2:])
# print results
print('{total} {heads} {tails}'.format(
 total=len(bits), heads=bits.count('0'), tails=bits.count('1')))
 

 Output 

 100 45 55
 
 #4 import random
tries = 0
heads=0
tails=0
while tries &lt; 100:
 tries += 1
 coin = random.randint(1, 2)
 if coin == 1:
  print('Heads')
  heads+=1
 if coin == 2:
  print ('Tails')
  tails+=1
total = tries
print(total)
print tails
print heads
 
 #5 # Please make sure to import random.

import random

# Create a list to store the results of the for loop; number of tosses are limited by range() and the returned values are limited by random.choice().

tossed = [random.choice(["heads", "tails"]) for toss in range(100)]

# Use .count() and .format() to calculate and substitutes the values in your output string.

print("There are {} heads and {} tails.".format(tossed.count("heads"), tossed.count("tails")))
 
 #6 tosses = 100
heads = sum(random.randint(0, 1) for toss in range(tosses))
tails = tosses - heads
