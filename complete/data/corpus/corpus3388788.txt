Question (ID-3388788): What's wrong with the "or" in my "if" statement? I've tried Google, but I can't find the answer to this simple question.
I hate myself for not being able to figure this out, but here we go. 

 How do I write an if statement with or in it? 

 For example: 

 if raw_input=="dog" or "cat" or "small bird":
 print "You can have this animal in your house"
else:
 print "I'm afraid you can't have this animal in your house."
 
 Answers (Total-6): #0 You can put the allowed animals into a tuple then use in to search for a match 

 if raw_input() in ("dog", "cat", "small bird"):
 print "You can have this animal in your house"
else:
 print "I'm afraid you can't have this animal in your house."
 

 You can also use a set here, but I doubt it would improve performance for such a small number of allowed animals 

 desired_animal = raw_input()
allowed_animals = set(("dog", "cat", "small bird"))
if desired_animal in allowed_animals:
 print "You can have this animal in your house"
else:
 print "I'm afraid you can't have this animal in your house."
 
 #1 If you want to use or , you need to repeat the whole expression each time: 

 if raw_input == "dog" or raw_input == "cat" or raw_input == "small bird":
 

 But a better way to do this particular comparison is with in : 

 if raw_input in ("dog", "cat", "small bird"):
 
 #2 if (raw_input=="dog") or (raw_input == "cat") or (raw_input == "small bird"):
 print You can have this animal in your house
else:
 print I'm afraid you can't have this animal in your house.
 

 or 

 if raw_input in ("dog", "cat", "small bird"):
 print You can have this animal in your house
else:
 print I'm afraid you can't have this animal in your house.
 
 #3 if (raw_input=="dog") or (raw_input=="cat") or (raw_input=="small bird"):
 print You can have this animal in your house
else:
 print "I'm afraid you can't have this animal in your house."
 
 #4 You can do it this way 

 if raw_input=="dog" or raw_input=="cat" or raw_input=="small bird":
 
 #5 goodanimals= ("dog" ,"cat","small bird")
print("You can have this animal in your house" if raw_input().strip().lower() in goodanimals
  else "I'm afraid you can't have this animal in your house.")
