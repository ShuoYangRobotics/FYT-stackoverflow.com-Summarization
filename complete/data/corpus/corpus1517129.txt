Question (ID-1517129): Python: how do I install SciPy on 64 bit Windows? How do I install SciPy on my system? 

 Update 1 : for the NumPy part (that SciPy depends on) there is actually an installer for 64 bit Windows: numpy-1.3.0.win-amd64-py2.6.msi (is direct download URL, 2310144 bytes). 

 Running the SciPy superpack installer results in this
message in a dialog box: 

 "Cannot install. Python version 2.6 required, which was not found in the registry." 

 I already have Python 2.6.2 installed (and a working Django installation
in it), but I don't know about any Registry story. 

 The registry entries seems to already exist: 

 REGEDIT4

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Python]

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Python\PythonCore]

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Python\PythonCore\2.6]

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Python\PythonCore\2.6\Help]

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Python\PythonCore\2.6\Help\Main Python Documentation]
@="D:\\Python262\\Doc\\python262.chm"

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Python\PythonCore\2.6\InstallPath]
@="D:\\Python262\\"

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Python\PythonCore\2.6\InstallPath\InstallGroup]

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Python\PythonCore\2.6\PythonPath]
@="D:\\Python262\\Lib;D:\\Python262\\DLLs;D:\\Python262\\Lib\\lib-tk"
 

 

 What I have done so far: 

 Step 1 

 Downloaded the NumPy superpack installer
numpy-1.3.0rc2-win32-superpack-python2.6.exe 
( direct download URL , 4782592 bytes). Running this installer
resulted in the same message, "Cannot install. Python
version 2.6 required, which was not found in the registry.".
 Update : there is actually an installer for NumPy that works - see beginning of the question. 

 Step 2 

 Tried to install NumPy in another way. Downloaded the zip
package numpy-1.3.0rc2.zip ( direct download URL , 2404011 bytes),
extracted the zip file in a normal way to a temporary
directory, D:\temp7\numpy-1.3.0rc2 (where setup.py and
README.txt is). I then opened a command line window and: 

 d:
cd D:\temp7\numpy-1.3.0rc2
setup.py install
 

 This ran for a long time and also included use of cl.exe
(part of Visual Studio). Here is a nearly 5000 lines long
 transcript (230 KB). 

 This seemed to work. I can now do this in Python: 

 import numpy as np
np.random.random(10)
 

 with this result: 

 array([ 0.35667511, 0.56099423, 0.38423629, 0.09733172, 0.81560421,
  0.18813222, 0.10566666, 0.84968066, 0.79472597, 0.30997724])
 

 Step 3 

 Downloaded the SciPy superpack installer, scipy-0.7.1rc3-
win32-superpack-python2.6.exe ( direct download URL , 45597175
bytes). Running this installer resulted in the message
listed in the beginning 

 Step 4 

 Tried to install SciPy in another way. Downloaded the zip
package scipy-0.7.1rc3.zip ( direct download URL , 5506562
bytes), extracted the zip file in a normal way to a
temporary directory, D:\temp7\scipy-0.7.1 (where setup.py
and README.txt is). I then opened a command line window and: 

 d:
cd D:\temp7\scipy-0.7.1
setup.py install
 

 This did not achieve much - here is a transcript (about 95
lines). 

 And it fails: 

 &gt;&gt;&gt; import scipy as sp2
Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
ImportError: No module named scipy
 

 

 Platform: Python 2.6.2 installed in directory D:\Python262,
Windows XP 64 bit SP2, 8 GB RAM, Visual Studio 2008
Professional Edition installed. 

 The startup screen of the installed Python is: 

 Python 2.6.2 (r262:71605, Apr 14 2009, 22:46:50) [MSC v.1500 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
 

 Value of PATH, result from SET in a command line window: 

 Path=D:\Perl64\site\bin;D:\Perl64\bin;C:\Program Files (x86)\PC Connectivity Solution\;D:\Perl\site\bin;D:\Perl\bin;C:\WINDOWS\system32;C:\WINDOWS;C:\WINDOWS\System32\Wbem;C:\Program Files (x86)\ATI Technologies\ATI.ACE\Core-Static;d:\Program Files (x86)\WinSCP\;D:\MassLynx\;D:\Program Files (x86)\Analyst\bin;d:\Python262;d:\Python262\Scripts;D:\Program Files (x86)\TortoiseSVN\bin;D:\Program Files\TortoiseSVN\bin;C:\WINDOWS\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0;D:\Program Files (x86)\IDM Computer Solutions\UltraEdit\
 
 Answers (Total-8): #0 Short answer: windows 64 support is still work in progress at this time. The superpack will certainly not work on a 64 bits python (but it should work fine on a 32 bits python, even on windows 64). 

 The main issue with windows 64 is that building with mingw-w64 is not stable at this point: it may be our's (numpy devs) fault, python's fault or mingw-w64. Most likely a combination of all those :). So you have to use proprietary compilers: anything other than MS compiler crashes numpy randomly; for the fortran compiler, ifort is the one to use. As of today, both numpy and scipy source code can be compiled with VS 2008 and ifort (all tests passing), but building it is still quite a pain, and not well supported by numpy build infrastructure. 
 #1 Unofficial 64-bit installers for numpy and scipy are available at http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ 
 #2 As the transcript for SciPy told you, SciPy isn't really supposed to work on Win64: 

 Warning: Windows 64 bits support is experimental, and only available for
testing. You are advised not to use it for production.
 

 So I would suggest to install the 32-bit version of Python, and stop attempting to build SciPy yourself. If you still want to try anyway, you first need to compile BLAS and LAPACK, as PiotrLegnica says. See the transcript for the places where it was looking for compiled versions of these libraries. 
 #3 Try to install Python 2.6.3 over your 2.6.2 (this should also add correct Registry entry), or to register your existing installation using this script . Installer should work after that. 

 Building SciPy requires a Fortran compiler and libraries - BLAS and LAPACK . 
 #4 I haven't tried it, but you may want to download this version of Portable Python . It comes with Scipy-0.7.0b1 running on Python 2.5.4. 
 #5 For completeness: Enthought has a Python distribution which includes SciPy; however, it's not free. Caveat: I've never used it. 
 #6 Another alternative: http://www.pythonxy.com/ 

 Free and includes lots of stuff meant to work together smoothly. 

 This person says 

 
 Did you try linux.pythonxy ? ( http://linux.pythonxy.com ). 
 
 It's 64 bit ready ... 
 

 Though I'm not quite sure what that means. 
 #7 I was getting this same error on a 32-bit machine. I fixed it by registering my python install, using the script at: 

 http://effbot.org/zone/python-register.htm 

 It's possible that the script would also make the 64-bit superpack installers work.
