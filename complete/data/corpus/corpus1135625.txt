 #1 The module is not likely in your python search path.. 

 Check to see if that module is in your Python Path ... In windows...you may find it in the registry 

 HKLM\Software\Python\PythonCore\2.6\PythonPath 

 Be careful editing it... 

 You may also alter the Python Path programmaticly by the following 

 import sys
sys.path.append('somepath_to_the_module_you_wanted')

import the_module_you_wanted
 

 Hope that helps 
 #2 I was having this problem and then I realised I was importing MySQLdb erroneously - it's case sensitive: 

 Incorrect: >>>import mysqldb 

 Correct: >>>import MySQLdb 

 Silly mistake, but cost me a few hours! 
 #3 generally, (good) python modules provide a 'setup.py' script that takes care of things like proper installation (google for 'distutils python'). MySQLdb is a "good" module in this sense. 

 since you're using windows, things might be a bit more complex. I assume you already installed MySQLdb following the instructions and it still gives this problem. what I would do is open a cmd.exe window, cd to the directory containing the 'setup.py' script and there type something like
C:\Python26\Python.exe setup.py install 

 if this does not work, then grab the module somewhere else, maybe at the place where it is actively developed: http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python/ 
 #4 See this post on the mysql-python blog: MySQL-python-1.2.3 beta 2 released - dated March 2009. Looks like MySQLdb for Python 2.6 is still a work in progress... 
 #5 I went for compiled binary , thats the best way to go on windows. There is a good source maintained by someone. 
I wrote about it here before because some months down the lane I will forget how I solved this and be searching Stack again :/
