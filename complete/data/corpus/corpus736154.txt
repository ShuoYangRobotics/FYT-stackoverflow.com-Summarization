Question (ID-736154): Examples of open source high quality, well designed python software? I am looking for a well-engineered, well-built python application that could serve as a guideline to demonstrate best practices relating to software development in general, and more specifically in python. (Note that software in other languages would also be welcome provided they are of good quality and could serve as models of good architecture).

 Not completely sure about the latter two, but Twisted and Django are both very well written/organised/documented 
 #1 SQLAlchemy 
 #2 Django 
 #3 Reddit. I've learned quite a bit about using Python for web development by browsing their source code. 
 #4 Jinja 2 . Not only its code but also the fantastic documentation that makes me wish every project had something like it. 
 #5 Sphinx 
 #6 SCons , the only Python application I've come to like and use. 
 #7 Bazaar 
 #8 BitTorrent? 
 #9 I'll add docutils , and particularly its statemachine module. It's reasonably well designed and sticks to the basics (i.e. little or no metaclasses and the source isn't overrun with underscore methods like __getattr__ ). 

 The project "eats its own dogfood" with all source code documentation for modules, classes, functions in reStructuredText format. Design and user documentation also written in reStructuredText.

 Django 
 Pygments 
 Trac 
 

 And actually, several project from Edgwall are in this case. 
 #11 I recently took a look over buildbot's code and it looked nice.
