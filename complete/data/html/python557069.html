<h3>Question (ID-557069):</h3><h2>Quick and dirty stripchart in python?</h2><p>I have some python code that receives a message every so often containing a timestamp and an edge transition, either low-to-high, or high-to-low. I'd like to graph each transition on a stripchart for a quick and dirty visualization of the digital waveform with the minimal amount of effort.</p>

<p>Can you recommend any methods or packages that would make this easy?</p>

<p>I'm also not opposed to exporting the data in, for instance, csv format and loading it into another program if that would be easier.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Tried CairoPlot:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; data = [(10, 0), (11, 1), (12.5, 0), (15, 1)]
&gt;&gt;&gt; def fn(t):
...     for d in data:
...             if t &gt; d[0]:
...                     return d[1]
...     return data[-1][1]
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; CairoPlot.function_plot( 'tester.png', data, 500, 300, discrete = True, h_bounds=( data[0][0],data[-1][0]), step = 1 )
</code></pre>

<p>This pinned my CPU at 100% for more than 10 minutes and was steadily eating memory. I killed it before it used up all of swap. Am I doing something wrong or is CairoPlot just broken?</p>

<p>Further edit:</p>

<p>I now have something more workable using CairoPlot, based loosely on the above code. However, it's not perfect because of the resolution: I may need up to tens of nanoseconds (1e-8) resolution in order to catch some of the shorter pulses. For a multi-second graph, this takes a <em>very</em> long time with this method.</p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>you may try using CairoPlot:</p>

<pre><code>import CairoPlot

#the data list stands for your low-to-high (1) and high-to-low (0) data
data = lambda x : [0,0,1,1,0,0,1][x]
CairoPlot.function_plot( 'Up_and_Down', data, 500, 300, discrete = True, x_bounds=( 0,len(data) - 1 ), step = 1 )
</code></pre>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>I didn't understand your function fn(t) here. The idea of the function_plot is to plot a function not a vector.</p>

<p>To plot those points, you could use function_plot on this way:</p>

<pre><code>#notice I have split your data into two different vectors,
#one for x axis and the other one for y axis
x_data = [10, 11, 12.5, 15]
y_data = [0, 1, 0, 1]

def get_data( i ):
    if i in x_data :
        return y_data[x_data.index(i)]
    else :
        return 0

CairoPlot.function_plot( 'Up_and_Down', get_data, 500, 300, discrete = True, x_bounds=( 0,20 ), step = 0.5 )
</code></pre>

<p>I guess that will work</p>

<p>For the 100% pinning CPU, that shouldn't happen... I'll take a look at it later today. Thanks for pointing it

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/" rel="nofollow">GnuPlot</a> is a the old reliable answer here, easy graphing with lots of options. I believe there are python bindings but it's probably easier to export your data and run it through regular gnuplot. Here's an ancient <a href="http://parand.com/docs/gnuplot.html" rel="nofollow">quick start doc</a> for it.</p>

<p>I'm also using <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">matplotlib</a> with great success for larger data sizes.</p>

<p>If I understand your question, you are receiving messages in realtime with nanosecond resolution timestamps, but you don't expect to see 10^9 messages per second.  If the average message rate is low (100 messages per second or fewer), I'd just ignore the timestamp and plot the transitions one message at a time.  If the graph timescale is 10ms per pixel, 4 transitions would be drawn over 40ms, but at least you wouldn't miss seeing that something happened.</p>
