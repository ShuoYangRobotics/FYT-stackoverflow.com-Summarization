<h3>Question (ID-4869391):</h3><h2>Distributing list items to variables in python</h2><p>I'm fairly new to Python and I'm looking for a way to distribute items in a list into individual variables. The point of this is to display individual items as text objects in Blender. Here's what I have so far, but I know there's gotta be a more efficient way to go about doing this.</p>

<pre><code>file = open('lyrics.conf')
data = file.read()
file.close()
b = data.split('/')
v = len(b)

if v &gt;= 1:
  v1 = b[0]
if v &gt;= 2:
  v2 = b[1]
if v &gt;= 3:
  v3 = b[2]
if v &gt;= 4:
  v4 = b[3]
if v &gt;= 5:
  v5 = b[4]
if v &gt;= 6:
  v6 = b[5]
if v &gt;= 7:
  v7 = b[6]
if v &gt;= 8:
  v8 = b[7]
if v &gt;= 9:
  v9 = b[8]
if v &gt;= 10:
  v10 = b[9]
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>With <code>b</code> you already have an easily accessible list of the items you want. Just access them, when you need them at their indices <code>b[0], b[1], ...</code>. Populating the namespace with too many variables, whose values can without major problems be stored in a container, is a design flaw (in my eyes).</p>

<hr>

<p>Here's a way to inject new variables into the current modules namespace, but it's <em>evil</em>:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python

import sys

somelist = range(10)

for i, item in enumerate(somelist):
    setattr(sys.modules[__name__], 'v{0}'.format(i), item)

print v1 + v2
# =&gt; 3
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Having these v1..10 variables seems like a code smell to me, but you can try this</p>

<pre><code>try:
  v1 = b[0]
  v2 = b[1]
  v3 = b[2]
  v4 = b[3]
  v5 = b[4]
  v6 = b[5]
  v7 = b[6]
  v8 = b[7]
  v9 = b[8]
  v10 = b[9]
except IndexError:
  pass
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>if you really want individual variables, at some point you have at least to do an unpacking like <code>v1,v2,v3,v4,v5,v6,v7,v8,v9,v10 = some_list</code></p>

<p>but why would you want to do this? if something is a collection/list of things, it is best represented as such.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>To process a list of verses, verse by verse:</p>

<pre><code>with open('lyrics.conf') as f:
    data = file.read()
verses = data.split('/')
def build_blender_object(verse):
  # Put meaningful code here
  pass
blender_objects = [build_blender_object(v) for v in verses]
</code></pre>

<p>Then do whatever you want with the blender objects. If the position in the list matters, then you can use enumerate() to associate an index with each blender object.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Just for fun</p>

<pre><code>b = "Some text/ with a / slash / character".split('/')
for i in range(len(b)):
    globals()['v' + str(i + 1)] = b[i]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Is it acceptable for the variables to exist and be set to None?</p>

<pre><code>v1,v2,v3,v4,v5,v6,v7,v8,v9,v10 = (b+[None]*10)[:10]
</code></pre>

<p>or </p>

<pre><code>v1,v2,v3,v4,v5,v6,v7,v8,v9,v10 = b+[None]*(10-len(b))
</code></pre>
