<h3>Question (ID-2561472):</h3><h2>fabric and svn password</h2><p>Assuming that I cannot run something like this with Fabric:</p>

<p><code>run("svn update --password 'password' .")</code> </p>

<p>how's the proper way to pass to Fabric the password for the remote interactive command line?</p>

<p>The problem is that the repo is checked out as svn+ssh and I don't have a http/https/svn option</p>

In this case, you will have to setup a sshkey between your remote server and the repo.</p>

<p>At remote server: Generate key pair</p>

<pre><code> $ ssh-keygen -t dsa
</code></pre>

<p>Leave the passphase empty! 
This will gerenate 2 files </p>

<ul>
<li>~/.ssh/id_dsa (private key)</li>
<li>~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub (public key)</li>
</ul>

<p>Then, append the content in id_dsa.pub to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys at repo server.</p>

<p>Your remote server will be able to update the source tree without using password.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>We had a problem similar to this a while back and actually proposed a new feature for Fabric, but the developer we spoke to suggested this instead.</p>

<pre><code>import getpass
password = getpass.getpass('Enter SVN Password: ')
run("svn update --password '%s'" % password)
</code></pre>

<p>This will prompt you for a password when the time comes for fabric to run this command.</p>

<p>I believe that will display your password in the fabric log, however, so a better option would be to get SVN to prompt you for the password and echo the password into it.</p>

<pre><code>run('echo %s | svn update --password' % password)
</code></pre>

<p>I don't use SVN though, so I'm afraid I'm not sure if that is possible. I hope someone else can help there!</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>My standard answer for automating interactive command lines is "use Expect", but you're using Python, so I will slightly refine that to "use <a href="http://pexpect.sourceforge.net/pexpect.html" rel="nofollow">Pexpect</a>".  </p>

<p>It might take a bit of thought to integrate Pexpect within Fabric, or perhaps you will just end up falling back to Pexpect alone for this particular case.  But it's definitely the way I would go.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You might need to supply the user as well?  If not, you may have better luck exporting your repo and making a tar of it (locally) to upload+deploy on the server. If you run the svn commands locally, you'll be able to get prompted for your username and/or password.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You should take a look at the <a href="http://docs.fabfile.org/0.9.0/usage/env.html" rel="nofollow">Fabric's env documentation</a>. There states that you should make something like this:</p>

<pre><code>from fabric.api import env

env.user = 'your_user'
env.password = 'your_password'
</code></pre>

<p>Hope it helps!</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>If yout just want to hide your password from log, you can use something like this:</p>

<pre><code>from fabric.state import output

def xrun(command, hidden='', *args, **kwargs):
    old_state = output.running
    output.running = False
    print '[%s] run: %s' % (env.host_string, command)
    run(command + hidden, *args, **kwargs)
    output.running = command

xrun('svn update', '--password "your password"')
</code></pre>
