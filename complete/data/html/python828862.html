<h3>Question (ID-828862):</h3><h2>Is Python2.6 stable enough for production use?</h2><p>Or should I just stick with Python2.5 for a bit longer?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>From <a href="http://python.org/download/" rel="nofollow">python.org</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The current production versions are
  Python 2.6.2 and Python 3.0.1.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, yes.</p>

<p>Python 3.x contains some backwards incompatible changes, so <a href="http://python.org/download/" rel="nofollow">python.org</a> also says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>start with Python 2.6 since more
  existing third party software is
  compatible with Python 2 than Python 3
  right now</p>
</blockquote>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Ubuntu has switched to 2.6 in it's latest release, and has not had any significant problems. So I would say "yes, it's stable".</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>It depends from libraries you use. For example there is no precompiled InformixDB package for 2.6 if you have to use Python on Windows.</p>

<p>Also web2py framework sticks with 2.5 because of some bug in 2.6.</p>

<p>Personally I use CPython 2.6 (workhorse) and 3.0 (experimental), and Jython 2.5 beta (for my test with JDBC and ODBC).</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Yes it it, but this is not the right question. The right question is "can I use Python 2.6, taking in consideration the incompatibilities it introduces ?". And the short answser is "most probably yes, unless you use a specific lib that wouldn't work with 2.6, which is pretty rare".</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I've found 2.6 to be fairly good with two exceptions:</p>

<ol>
<li>If you're using it on a server, I've had trouble in the past with some libraries which are used by elements of the server (Debian Etch IIRC). It's possible with a bit of jiggery pokery to maintain several versions of python in unison though if you're careful :-)</li>
<li>This is no-longer true, but the last time I tried 2.6, wxPython had not been updated which meant all my gui tools I've written broke. There's now a version available that's built against 2.6.</li>
</ol>

<p>So I'd suggest you check all the modules you use and check their compatibility with 2.6...</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I recently switched from python2.5 to 2.6 for my research project involving lots of 3rd party libs (scipy, pydot, etc.) and swig related stuff. </p>

<p>The only thing I had to change was to convert all strings with</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>s = unicode(s, "utf-8")</p>
</blockquote>

<p>before I fed them into the logging module.</p>

<p>Otherwise, I got everytime </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Traceback (most recent call last):<br />
    File "/usr/lib/python2.6/logging/__init__.py", line 773, in emit<br />
