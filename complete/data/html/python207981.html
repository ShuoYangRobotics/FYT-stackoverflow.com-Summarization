<h3>Question (ID-207981):</h3><h2>How to enable MySQL client auto re-connect with MySQLdb?</h2><p>I came across PHP way of doing the trick:</p>

<pre><code>my_bool reconnect = 1;
mysql_options(&amp;mysql, MYSQL_OPT_RECONNECT, &amp;reconnect);
</code></pre>

<p>but no luck with MySQLdb (python-mysql).</p>

<p>Can anybody please give a clue? Thanks.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I solved this problem by creating a function that wraps the <code>cursor.execute()</code> method since that's what was throwing the <code>MySQLdb.OperationalError</code> exception. The other example above implies that it is the <code>conn.cursor()</code> method that throws this exception.</p>

<pre><code>import MySQLdb

class DB:
  conn = None

  def connect(self):
    self.conn = MySQLdb.connect()

  def query(self, sql):
    try:
      cursor = self.conn.cursor()
      cursor.execute(sql)
    except (AttributeError, MySQLdb.OperationalError):
      self.connect()
      cursor = self.conn.cursor()
      cursor.execute(sql)
    return cursor

db = DB()
sql = "SELECT * FROM foo"
cur = db.query(sql)
# wait a long time for the Mysql connection to timeout
cur = db.query(sql)
# still works
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>If you are using ubuntu Linux there was a patch added to the python-mysql package that added the ability to set that same MYSQL_OPT_RECONNECT option (see <a href="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/hardy/+source/python-mysqldb/1.2.2-5" rel="nofollow">here</a>).  I have not tried it though.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the patch was later removed due to a conflict with autoconnect and transations (described <a href="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python-mysqldb" rel="nofollow">here</a>).</p>

<p>The comments from that page say:
1.2.2-7 Published in intrepid-release on 2008-06-19 </p>

<p>python-mysqldb (1.2.2-7) unstable; urgency=low</p>

      Comment in Storm which explains the problem:</p>

<pre><code>    # Here is another sad story about bad transactional behavior. MySQL
    # offers a feature to automatically reconnect dropped connections.
    # What sounds like a dream, is actually a nightmare for anyone who
    # is dealing with transactions. When a reconnection happens, the
    # currently running transaction is transparently rolled back, and
    # everything that was being done is lost, without notice. Not only
    # that, but the connection may be put back in AUTOCOMMIT mode, even
    # when that's not the default MySQLdb behavior. The MySQL developers
    # quickly understood that this is a terrible idea, and removed the
    # behavior in MySQL 5.0.3. Unfortunately, Debian and Ubuntu still
    # have a patch right now which *reenables* that behavior by default
    # even past version 5.0.3.
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You other bet it to work around dropped connections yourself with code.</p>

<p>One way to do it would be the following:</p>

<pre><code>import MySQLdb

class DB:
    conn = None

    def connect(self):
        self.conn = MySQLdb.connect()

    def cursor(self):
        try:
            return self.conn.cursor()
        except (AttributeError, MySQLdb.OperationalError):
            self.connect()
            return self.conn.cursor()

db = DB()
cur = db.cursor()
# wait a long time for the Mysql connection to timeout
cur = db.cursor()
# still works
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I had a similar problem with MySQL and Python, and the solution that worked for me was to upgrade MySQL to 5.0.27 (on Fedora Core 6; your system may work fine with a different version).</p>

<p>I tried a lot of other things, including patching the Python libraries, but upgrading the database was a lot easier and (I think) a better decision.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Hmm, transactions are only an issue if you use InnoDB and transactions!  The python-mysqldb people have made a political, not technical decision to remove this option.  Screws people over who actually use this feature.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>you can separate the commit and the close for the connection...that's not cute but it does it.</p>

<pre><code>class SqlManager(object):
 """
 Class that handle the database operation
 """
 def __init__(self,server, database, username, pswd):

      self.server = server
      self.dataBase = database
      self.userID = username
      self.password = pswd

def Close_Transation(self):
      """
      Commit the SQL Query
      """
      try:
        self.conn.commit()
      except Sql.Error, e:
        print "-- reading SQL Error %d: %s" % (e.args[0], e.args[1])

 def Close_db(self):
    try:
        self.conn.close()
    except Sql.Error, e:
        print "-- reading SQL Error %d: %s" % (e.args[0], e.args[1])

 def __del__(self):
    print "close connection with database.."
    self.conn.close()
