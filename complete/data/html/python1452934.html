<h3>Question (ID-1452934):</h3><h2>What is the meaning of #XXX?</h2><p>I have seen this a lot in code, even vim marks it as a special case. #TODO and #FIXME are two other fix markers vim highlights but what does #XXX means?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p><code>XXX</code> in a comment is usually a heads-up. It could be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Something that's not implemented completely correctly.</li>
<li>Something that should be fixed later on.</li>
<li>Highlighting a possible problem spot.</li>
<li>Something you're not sure about, a question.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've often preferred a more descriptive tag like <code>FIXME</code> or <code>TODO</code> or <code>HACK</code>. <code>XXX</code> is often used as a catch all for the above. </p>

<p>Searching for 'XXX' on the <a href="http://fxr.watson.org/fxr/search?string=XXX" rel="nofollow">FreeBSD code cross reference</a> is a good example of many of the uses. There are thousands...</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Some notes from a <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0350" rel="nofollow">June 2005 Python Enhancement Proposal that was rejected</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Choosing between <code>FIXME</code> and <code>XXX</code> is difficult.<br>
  <code>XXX</code> seems to be more common, but much less descriptive.<br>
  Furthermore, <code>XXX</code> is a useful placeholder in a piece of code<br>
  having a value that is unknown.</p>
  
  <p>Thus <code>FIXME</code> is the preferred spelling.<br>
  Sun says that <code>XXX</code> and <code>FIXME</code> are slightly different, giving <code>XXX</code> higher severity.<br>
  However, with decades of chaos on this topic, and too many millions of<br>
  developers who won't be influenced by Sun, it is easy to rightly call them synonyms.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What Are Codetags?</p>
  
  <p>Programmers widely use ad-hoc code comment markup conventions to serve
  as reminders of sections of code that need closer inspection or
  review.  Examples of markup include <code>FIXME</code>, <code>TODO</code>, <code>XXX</code>,
  <code>BUG</code>, but there many more in wide use in existing software.  Such
  markup will henceforth be referred to as <em>codetags</em>.  These codetags
  may show up in application code, unit tests, scripts, general
  documentation, or wherever suitable.</p>

<p>The PEP is an interesting read.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I use XXX because it's easier to type than TODO.</p>

<p>XXX is for when you're in a hurry and will get back to this yourself.</p>

<p>TODO is for when you have to hand it off to someone else.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Probably it's for cases that you don't know how to handle.<br />
Check out this: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/editra-plugins/wiki/CommentBrowser" rel="nofollow">List view of TODO/FIXME/XXX/HACK statements</a></p>

<p><img src="http://editra-plugins.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/commentbrowser/cb%5Fscreenshot.PNG" alt="alt text" /></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><ul>
<li>NOTE: Description of how the code works (when it isn't self evident)</li>
<li>XXX: Warning about possible pitfalls, can be used as NOTE:XXX:</li>
<li>HACK: Not very well written or malformed code to circumvent a problem/bug. Should be used as HACK:FIXME:</li>
<li>FIXME: This works, sort of, but it could be done better. (usually code written in a hurry that needs rewriting)</li>
<li>BUG: There is a problem here.</li>
<li>TODO: No problem, but addtional code needs to be written (usually when you are skipping something)</li>
</ul>

<p>At least this is how I was taught about these tags. Basically the first two (NOTE and XXX) are used for information and no action is required. While the last three (FIXME, BUG and TODO) Do require action. HACK is somewhere in between (and hardly ever used I think?).</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>A placeholder, usually implying the code it refers to is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ugly</li>
<li>Scary</li>
<li>Magic</li>
</ul>

<p>or worse.</p>
