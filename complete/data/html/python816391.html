<h3>Question (ID-816391):</h3><h2>Python: avoiding pylint warnings about too many arguments</h2><p>I want to refactor a big Python function into smaller ones. For example, consider this following code snippet:</p>

<pre><code>x = x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 + x6 + x7 + x8 + x9
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, this is a trivial example. In practice, the code is more complex. My point is that it contains many local-scope variables that would have to be passed to the extracted function, which could look like:</p>

<pre><code>def mysum(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7, x8, x9):
    x = x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 + x6 + x7 + x8 + x9
    return x
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that pylint would trigger a warning about too many arguments.
I could avoid the warning by doing something like:</p>

<pre><code>def mysum(d):
    x1 = d['x1']
    x2 = d['x2']
    ...
    x9 = d['x9']
    x = x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 + x6 + x7 + x8 + x9
    return x

def mybigfunction():
    ...
    d = {}
    d['x1'] = x1
    ...
    d['x9'] = x9
    x = mysum(d)
</code></pre>

<p>but this approach loos ugly to me, it requires writing a lot of code that is even redundant.</p>

<p>Is there a better way to do it?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>First, one of Perlis's epigrams:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"If you have a procedure with 10
  parameters, you probably missed some."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some of the 10 arguments are presumably related. Group them into an object, and pass that instead.</p>

<p>Making an example up, because there's not enough information in the question to answer directly:</p>

<pre><code>class PersonInfo(object):
  def __init__(self, name, age, iq):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
    self.iq = iq
</code></pre>

<p>Then your 10 argument function:</p>

<pre><code>def f(x1, x2, name, x3, iq, x4, age, x5, x6, x7):
  ...
</code></pre>

<p>becomes:</p>

<pre><code>def f(personinfo, x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7):
  ...
</code></pre>

<p>and the caller changes to:</p>

<pre><code>personinfo = PersonInfo(name, age, iq)
result = f(personinfo, x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You could try using <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/controlflow.html#arbitrary-argument-lists" rel="nofollow">Python's variable arguments</a> feature:</p>

<pre><code>def myfunction(*args):
    for x in args:
        # Do stuff with specific argument here
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Perhaps you could turn some of the arguments into member variables. If you need that much state a class sounds like a good idea to me. </p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You can easily change the maximum allowed number of arguments in pylint. Just open your pylintrc file (generate it if you don't already have one) and change:</p>

<p>max-args=5</p>

<p>to:</p>

<p>max-args = 6 # or any value that suits you </p>

<p>From pylint's <a href="http://www.logilab.org/card/pylint%5Fmanual" rel="nofollow">manual</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Specifying all the options suitable
  for your setup and coding standards
  can be tedious, so it is possible to
  use a rc file to specify the default
  values. Pylint looks for /etc/pylintrc
  and ~/.pylintrc. The --generate-rcfile
  option will generate a commented
  configuration file according to the
  current configuration on standard
  output and exit. You can put other
  options before this one to use them in
  the configuration, or start with the
  default values and hand tune the
  configuration.</p>
</blockquote>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Simplify or break apart the function so that it doesn't require nine arguments (or ignore pylint, but dodges like the ones you're proposing defeat the purpose of a lint tool).</p>

<p>EDIT: if it's a temporary measure, disable the warning for the particular function in question using a comment as described here: <a href="http://lists.logilab.org/pipermail/python-projects/2006-April/000664.html" rel="nofollow">http://lists.logilab.org/pipermail/python-projects/2006-April/000664.html</a></p>

<p>Later, you can grep for all of the disabled warnings.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Do you want a better way to pas the arguments or just a way to stop pylint from nagging you about it? If the latter, I seem to recall that you could stop the nagging by putting pylint-controlling comments in your code along the lines of:</p>

<pre><code>#pylint: disable-msg=R0913,R0914
</code></pre>

<p>In my opinion, there's nothing inherently wrong with passing a lot of arguments and solutions advocating wrapping them all up in some container argument don't solve any problems (other than the nagging pylint :-).</p>

<p>If you need to pass twenty arguments, then pass them. It may be that this is required because your function is doing too much and a re-factoring could assist there. But that's not a decision we can really make unless we see what the 'real' code is.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Python has some nice functional programming tools that are likely to fit your needs well. Check out <a href="http://www.secnetix.de/olli/Python/lambda%5Ffunctions.hawk" rel="nofollow">lambda functions</a> and <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html" rel="nofollow">map</a>. Also, you're using dicts when it seems like you'd be much better served with lists. For the simple example you provided, try this idiom. Note that map would be better and faster but may not fit your needs:</p>

<pre><code>def mysum(d):
   s = 0  
   for x in d:
        s += x
   return s

def mybigfunction():
   d = (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7, x8, x9)
   return mysum(d)
</code></pre>

<p>You mentioned having a lot of local variables, but frankly if you're dealing with lists (or tuples), you should use lists and factor out all those local variables in the long run.</p>
