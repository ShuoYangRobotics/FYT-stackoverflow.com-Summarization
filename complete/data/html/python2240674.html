<h3>Question (ID-2240674):</h3><h2>Cross-platform desktop notifier in Python</h2><p>I am looking for <a href="http://growl.info/" rel="nofollow">Growl</a>-like, Windows balloon-tip-like notifications library in Python. Imagine writing code like:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import desktopnotifier as dn
&gt;&gt;&gt; dn.notify('Title', 'Long description goes here')
</code></pre>

<p>.. and that would notify with corresponding tooltips on Mac, Windows and Linux. Does such a library exist? If not, how would I go about writing one myself?</p>

<ul>
<li>Does Mac come with a default notifier? Is <a href="http://growl.info/" rel="nofollow">Growl</a> something that I should install separately?</li>
<li>On Windows, I assume this may require <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/" rel="nofollow">pywin32</a>?</li>
<li>On Linux, assuming GNOME, is there a GNOME API (using gnome-python) that does this?</li>
<li>Can I make notifications 'sticky' (i.e., don't fade out ever) on all platforms?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: My preference is to <em>not</em> depend on gigantic GUI frameworks like PyQT4 and wxPython for a simple task such as this.</p>

It contains a threaded event loop that can be used to animate a notification window containing an icon and message that can be clicked on. It probably needs a couple of tweaks to customize it for your own purpose but the ground work is done.</p>

<li><p>How to go about writing it</p>

<p>Check how <code>keyring</code> handles the cross-platform issues (it's a python library which plugs into various autodetected keychain backends for storage)</p></li>
<li><p>Growl isn't bundled with OSX you have to install it separately, OSX doesn't come with any built-in notification system.</p></li>
<li><p>For unices, you might want to hook into DBus as already mentioned (as a fallback, note that dbus might also be available in OSX), but both KDE and Gnome have Growl-like libraries. Respectively, KNotification for KDE and libnotify for Gnome.</p></li>
<li><p>For windows, check out Snarl, fall back no notification bubbles if not available (using something along the lines of <a href="http://xoomer.virgilio.it/infinity77/main/ToasterBox.html">ToasterBox</a>)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Do <em>not ever</em> even think of making notifications sticky. It's stupid, it's insensitive and it's freaking annoying. Also, due to people like you it's been made <em>not</em> available in most notification systems.</p>

<p>Finally, even if there is no Python lib for any of these, you can probably use <code>ctypes</code> to access them.</p>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>At Pycon 2010 there was a <a href="http://python.mirocommunity.org/video/1595/pycon-2010-cross-platform-appl" rel="nofollow">presentation on cross-platform Python development</a>. 
There was a html page about it as well, containing some advice for cross-platform notification. However, I don't find it online anymore, but I saved a local copy, and this is the part on notifications:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are occasions in which your application wants to notify the user
  about something: software updates are available, a new instant message
  have been received, the 300 page print job has finally finished, etc.</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>To keep notifications easy to port cross-platform, don't make
  them interactive. For example Ubuntu does not support notifications
  that require user interaction.</li>
  <li><p>These are the most important libraries:</p>
  
  <p>o Linux: <a href="http://www.galago-project.org/" rel="nofollow">pynotify</a>.</p>
  
  <p>o Mac OS X: Growl, which is not standard, is usually
  installed.</p>
  
  <p>o Windows: a good wxPython solution is <a href="http://xoomer.virgilio.it/infinity77/main/freeware.html#toasterbox" rel="nofollow">ToasterBox</a> of Andrea
  Gavana, which mimics the look of Firefox or Thunderbird notifications.</p></li>
  <li><p>For Phatch we developed a library that unifies these three
  systems in one API: <a href="http://bazaar.launchpad.net/%7Estani/phatch/trunk/annotate/head:/phatch/lib/notify.py" rel="nofollow">phatch/lib/notify.py</a>.</p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The linked python file is very interesting, and I think you should be able to use the linked python file almost as is. The code is also very clear, so you'll quickly see what it does.</p>

<p>The basic approach is it detects what notification systems are available, almost regardless of the platform, and tries to use them in a certain order but falls back to more simple systems if necessary. This way, if the user has e.g. Growl installed it'll use it, regardless of the platform.</p>

<p>You could adapt it to provide support for other notification systems than the three mentioned above.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>For good cross-platform support, I would look at <a href="http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download" rel="nofollow">PyQt</a>. It will add some heft to your library, but they've done a good job working out most of the kinks.</p>
