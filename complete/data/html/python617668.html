<h3>Question (ID-617668):</h3><h2>Looking for a self-contained equation rendering library</h2><p>Is there such a thing as a small, self-contained library that will render an equation written in a text-based format (e.g. LaTeX or MathML) to an image (either vector or raster)? </p>

<p>It would be preferable if it's in Python or Python-friendly.</p>

<p>(One possibility that I've found: <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">Matplotlib</a> has Python code to parse and display LaTeX equations, using gl2ps. If I don't find anything else it seems possible to extract all the relevant bits into a separate library.)</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> by "self-contained" I mean they can't use TeX/LaTex itself since unfortunately I can't rely on it being installed</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>There's mimetex a stand alone program for rendering latex math... it's not a library however</p>

 (version 2.7) generates PNG images from LaTex equations using Java/Jython.
 Latex equations can be included into Python (Jython) multiline
 comments using "$" or "$$" keywords (as for the standard LaTeX) 
 and then the program renders them into images embeded
 in HTML represenation of Python/Jython source code (CodeView feature)</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>A versatile program and Python module to allow conversion of LaTeX math equations in to PNG images: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/latexmath2png/" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/latexmath2png/</a> (MIT license, relies on <code>dvipng</code>).</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I don't know if this meets your requirements, but I knew MoinMoin has had latex extensions for a while so I looked again and found this:</p>

<p><a href="http://johannes.sipsolutions.net/Projects/new-moinmoin-latex" rel="nofollow">MoinMoin Latex Support</a></p>

<p>You should be able to take this code and re-use it in your app.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Maybe You need gnuplot</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Try ReforMath (http://reformath.webnode.com). It is C++ based and runs under both Windows and Linux. Although unfinished, it can render a number MathML elements.</p>
