<h3>Question (ID-2072875):</h3><h2>Python class methods</h2><p>I have a class as follows:</p>

<pre><code>class X:
    def __init__(self):
          self.sum_x =0.0
          self.sum_x_squared=0.0
          self.var_x =0.0
          self.sum_y =0.0
          self.sum_y_squared=0.0
          self.var_y =0.0

    def update(self,data):
         [x,y,vx,vy]=data
         self.update_sums(self.sum_x,self.sum_x_squared,x)
         self.update_sums(self.sum_y,self.sum_y_squared,y)
         .


    def update_sums(self,sums,squares,val):
          sums += val
          squares += val*val
          .
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to pass the member variables <code>sum_x</code>, <code>sum_x_squared</code> etc to the <code>update_sums</code> function for update how do I do this, I am confused.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>First, note that your question has nothing to do with <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html?highlight=classmethod#classmethod" rel="nofollow">classmethod</a> (which makes <em>class</em> methods in Python) -- it's entirely about normal <em>instance</em> methods (you should edit your title... or your question, if you <strong>do</strong> mean it to be about <strong>class</strong> methods).</p>

<p>For the Q as it stands, the only way to do what you want is to pass the <em>names</em> of the attributes that the method needs to set (or enough data to let the method reconstruct the names), e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>def update(self,data):
     x, y, vx, vy = data
     self.update_sums('x' , x)
     self.update_sums('y' , y)

def update_sums(self, attname, val):
     sums = 'sum_' + attname
     setattr(self, sums, getattr(self, sums, 0) + val)
     sums = 'sum_' + attname + '_squared'
     setattr(self, sums, getattr(self, sums, 0) + val * val)
</code></pre>

<p>I would not recommend this approach, in general, as it makes code bulkier, less readable, and marginally less efficient than the elementary approach of just hard-coding the attribute names. If the auxiliary method (here <code>update_sums</code>) encapsulates a lot of tricky logic that you're really very keen to avoid duplicating, maybe; but while eliminating repetition is a very worthwhile task, it takes taste and balance to avoid going overboard with it;-).</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>you don't need to pass nothing but the <code>self</code>, which you're mandated to do anyway:</p>

<pre><code>def update_sums(self, val):
    self.sum += val
    self.sum_squared += val * val
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>the call will be the following: <code>self.update_sums(x)</code></p>

<p>The way you designed the class so far is not very useful or flexible, I'd suggest something along these lines:</p>

<pre><code>class X:
    def __init__(self):
          self.sums = [0] * 4
          self.sums_squared = [0] * 4

    def update(self, data):
         self.update_sums(data)

    def update_sums(self, vals):
          self.sums = [i + j for i, j in zip(self.sums, vals)]
          self.sums_squared = [i + j*j for i, j in zip(self.sums, vals)]
</code></pre>

<p>It's still no ideal, because I don't know what the purpose of this whole thing is, but it's better then to have all those values.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>No need. You have direct access to self.sumx, etc.</p>

<p>Are you sure that the functions do belong to the class X? You seem to be missing semicolon and whitespace formatting.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You don't have to pass them, update_sums can access them just like update can.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>It looks to me like there is another class in there wanting to be let out.  I would remove duplication by refactoring the code like this:</p>

<pre><code>class SumOfSquares(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.sum = 0.0
        self.squares = 0.0

    def update(self, val):
        self.sum += val
        self.squares += val * val

class X(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.x = SumOfSquares()
        self.y = SumOfSquares()

    def update(self,data):
         [x,y,vx,vy]=data
         self.x.update(x)
         self.y.update(y)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>self.sumx, self.sum_x_squared?</p>
