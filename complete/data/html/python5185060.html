<h3>Question (ID-5185060):</h3><h2>insertion sort get indices?</h2><p>I use the following algorithm for insertion sort:</p>

<pre><code>def insertionSort(A):
    indices = [z for z in xrange(len(A))]
    for j in range(1, len(A)):
        key = A[j]
        i = j-1
        while (i&gt;=0) and (A[i]&lt;key):
            A[i+1] = A[i]  
            indices[j-i-1] = i+1         
            i = i-1

        A[i+1] = key
</code></pre>

<p>However, I need to maintain a list to map the indices of the original values of A  to the sorted values of A, which means if I have a list of [1,3,4,2] after sorting the list = [4,3,2,1] i will have a indices list of [3,1,0,2].</p>

<p>Any pointers? I'm kinda stuck.</p>

<p><strong>EDITED</strong>: apologies, sorting in descending order..</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Why are you writing a sort?  Use Python's builtin sorting.</p>

<pre><code>def sort_with_indexes(data):
    sorted_data = sorted(enumerate(data), key=lambda key: key[1])
    indexes = range(len(data))
    indexes.sort(key=lambda key: sorted_data[key][0])
    return [i[1] for i in sorted_data], indexes

data, indexes = sort_with_indexes([1,3,4,2])
print data, indexes
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>the fix to NullUserException's answer is simple:</p>

<pre><code>sorted_list, mapping = zip(*sorted([ (v, i) for i, v in enumerate(l) ]))
index_list = [ mapping.index(i) for i in range(len(sorted_list)) ]
</code></pre>

<p>just replace the call to sorted with your sorting algorithm.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>When you set <code>A[i+1]=key</code>, clearly <code>indices[j]=i+1</code>.  However, when you set <code>A[i+1]=A[i]</code> You must increment the value of the element of <code>indices</code> that has the <em>value</em> <code>i</code> (because the element of <code>A</code> that was at <code>i</code> is now at <code>i+1</code>).  Unfortunately, I think the naive implementation of this algorithm will be O(n^3) in the worst case.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Seems like your idea of changing the indices array while changing the original in order to keep track of them should work.  I find that when I sometimes have trouble tracking two indices at once and I'll often resort to stepping through the loop(s) on paper to figure out where I'm going wrong.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I modified your version slightly. It now sorts the list A in place (non descending) and returns a list with the "sorted indices".</p>

<pre><code>def insertionSort(A):
    sorted_indices = [0]
    for j in range(1, len(A)):
        sorted_indices.append(j)
        key = A[j]
        i = j - 1
        while i &gt;= 0 and A[i] &gt; key:
            A[i+1] = A[i]
            sorted_indices[i+1] = sorted_indices[i]
            i -= 1
        A[i+1] = key
        sorted_indices[i+1] = j
    return sorted_indices
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I was trying to solve the same problem, but I was sorting arrays rather than lists.  The problem with using sorted was that it returns a list, which for my purposes took up too much memory.  Luckily, you can do this with numpy using arrays and argsort:</p>

<pre><code>import numpy
a=numpy.array([1,3,4,2])
p=a.argsort()
</code></pre>

<p>Which will give array([0,3,1,2]) as a result.  This is sorted low to high.</p>
