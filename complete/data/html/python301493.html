<h3>Question (ID-301493):</h3><h2>Which language is easiest and fastest to work with XML content?</h2><p>We have developers with knowledge of these languages - Ruby , Python, .Net or Java. We are developing an application which will mainly handle XML documents. Most of the work is to convert predefined XML files into database tables, providing mapping between XML documents through database, creating reports from database etc. Which language will be the easiest and fastest to work with?
(It is a web-app)</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>A dynamic language rules for this.  Why?  The mappings are easy to code and change.  You don't have to recompile and rebuild.</p>

<p>Indeed, with a little cleverness, you can have your "XML XPATH to a Tag -> DB table-field" mappings as disjoint blocks of Python code that your main application imports.</p>

<p>The block of Python code <strong>is</strong> your configuration file.  It's not an <code>.ini</code> file or a <code>.properties</code> file that describes a configuration.  It <strong>is</strong> the configuration.</p>

<p>We use Python, xml.etree and the SQLAlchemy (to separate the SQL out of your programs) for this because we're up and running with very little effort and a great deal of flexibility.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>To make changes, you can correct a builder or create a new builder.  You adjust the loader source to identify which builder will be used.  You can, without too much trouble, make the selection of builder a command-line parameter.  Dynamic imports in dynamic languages seem like overkill to me, but they are handy.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><h2>XSLT</h2>

<p>I suggest using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xslt" rel="nofollow">XSLT templates</a> to transform the XML into INSERT statements (or whatever you need), as required.<br />
You should be able to invoke XSLT from any of the languages you mention.  </p>

<p>This will result in a lot less code than doing it the long way round.  </p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>In .NET, C# 3.0 and VB9 provide excellent support for working with XML using LINQ to XML:</p>

<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb387061.aspx" rel="nofollow">LINQ to XML Overview</a></p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I'll toss in a suggestion for <a href="http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/hpricot/" rel="nofollow">Hpricot</a>, a popular Ruby XML parser (although there are many similar options).</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>Given the following XML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Export&gt;
  &lt;Product&gt;
    &lt;SKU&gt;403276&lt;/SKU&gt;
    &lt;ItemName&gt;Trivet&lt;/ItemName&gt;
    &lt;CollectionNo&gt;0&lt;/CollectionNo&gt;
    &lt;Pages&gt;0&lt;/Pages&gt;
  &lt;/Product&gt;
&lt;/Export&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You parse simply by:</p>

<pre><code>FIELDS = %w[SKU ItemName CollectionNo Pages]

doc = Hpricot.parse(File.read("my.xml")) 
(doc/:product).each do |xml_product|
  product = Product.new
  for field in FIELDS
    product[field] = (xml_product/field.intern).first.innerHTML
  end
  product.save
end
</code></pre>

<p>It sounds like your application would be very fit for a <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org" rel="nofollow">Rails</a> application,  You could quickly prototype what you need, you've got direct interaction with your database of choice and you can output the data however you need to.</p>

<p>Here's another great resource page for <a href="http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/hpricot/wiki/HpricotXML" rel="nofollow">parsing XML with Hpricot</a> that might help as well as the <a href="http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/doc/hpricot/" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>either C# or VB.Net using LiNQ to XML. LiNQ to XML is very very powerful and easy to implement</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>For quick turnaround I've found <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/Processing+XML" rel="nofollow">Groovy</a> very useful.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>An interesting solution could be Ruby.
Simply use XML->Object mappers and then use an object-relational-mapper (ORM) to put it inside a database.
I had to do a short talk on XML Mapping with ruby, you could look at the slides and see what you like best: <a href="http://www.marc-seeger.de/2008/11/25/ruby-xml-mapping/" rel="nofollow">http://www.marc-seeger.de/2008/11/25/ruby-xml-mapping/</a></p>

<p>As for the ORM: Active Record or Datamapper should be the way to go</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>ECMAScript handles XML pretty nicely using E4X ("ECMAScript for XML"). This can be seen in Adobe's latest version of ActionScript, version 3. I believe JavaScript 2 (to be released with Firefox 4, I think) will support E4X as well.</p>

<p>Not sure about the support of the standalone JavaScript interpreters (i.e. Rhino, et al) of this, which is what matters most to you I suppose... But if it looks good to you, you can always look up their support for it (and report back to us :-)).</p>

<p>See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E4X#Example" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E4X#Example</a> for a simple example.</p>
