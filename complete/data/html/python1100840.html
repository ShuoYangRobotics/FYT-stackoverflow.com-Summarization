<h3>Question (ID-1100840):</h3><h2>IRC Python Bot: Best Way</h2><p>I want to build a bot that basically does the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Listens to the room and interacts with users and encourages them to PM the bot.</li>
<li>Once a user has PMed the bot engage with the client using various AI techniques. </li>
</ol>

<p>Should I just use the IRC library or Sockets in python or do I need more of a bot framework.</p>

<p>What would you do?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Here is the code I'm currently using, however, I haven't gotten it to work.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python 
import socket
network = 'holmes.freenet.net'
port = 6667
irc = socket.socket ( socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM )
irc.connect ( ( network, port ) )
irc.send ( 'NICK PyIRC\r\n' )
irc.send ( 'USER PyIRC PyIRC PyIRC :Python IRC\r\n' )
irc.send ( 'JOIN #pyirc\r\n' )
irc.send ( 'PRIVMSG #pyirc :Can you hear me?\r\n' )
irc.send ( 'PART #pyirc\r\n' )
irc.send ( 'QUIT\r\n' )
irc.close()
</code></pre>

It is possible to just do it with sockets but why bother doing it from scratch?</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>If you want to have AI techniques involved, then I suggest you look at the <a href="http://pyaiml.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">AIML</a> package for Python. It is the same technology that ALICE bots are done in.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I made a (very crappy, and for a long time being refactored) <a href="https://github.com/xiongchiamiov/mpu/" rel="nofollow">IRC bot</a> using <a href="http://python-irclib.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">irclib</a>.  The documentation is next-to-nothing, but it gets rid of making you have to do all that socket connecting and such, which is stuff I really don't want to deal with.  To each his own, though.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Use an existing IRC library instead of implementing the protocol yourself.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>If what you want is to create the AI portion, why bother writing all the code needed for the IRC connection by yourself?</p>

<p>I suggest using <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/supybot/" rel="nofollow">SupyBot</a>, and simply write your AI-code as a plugin for it. There is reasonably understandable documentation and lots of example-code to find. Also, it comes with a decent amount of plugins for all sorts of uses that might complement your AI.</p>

<p>Just try my 'Yet Another Useless IRC Bot' here <a href="https://github.com/julienpalard/yauib" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/julienpalard/yauib</a> permitting you to code each feature of your bot using whatever language you want.</p>
