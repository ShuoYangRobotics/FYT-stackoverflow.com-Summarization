<h3>Question (ID-357997):</h3><h2>Does Python have something like anonymous inner classes of Java?</h2><p>In Java you can define a new class inline using anonymous inner classes. This is useful when you need to rewrite only a single method of the class.</p>

<p>Suppose that you want create a subclass of <code>OptionParser</code> that overrides only a single method (for example <code>exit()</code>). In Java you can write something like this:</p>

<pre><code>new OptionParser () {

    public void exit() {
        // body of the method
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>This piece of code creates a anonymous class that extends <code>OptionParser</code> and override only the <code>exit()</code> method.</p>

<p>There is a similar idiom in Python? Which idiom is used in these circumstances?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Java uses anonymous classes mostly to imitate closures or simply code blocks. Since in Python you can easily pass around methods there's no need for a construct as clunky as anonymous inner classes:</p>

<pre><code>def printStuff():
   print "hello"

def doit(what):
   what()

doit(printStuff)
</code></pre>

<p>Edit: I'm aware that this is not what is needed in this special case. I just described the most common python solution to the problem most commonly by anonymous inner classes in Java.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You can accomplish this in three ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>Proper subclass (of course)</li>
<li>a custom method that you invoke with the object as an argument</li>
<li>(what you probably want) -- adding a new method to an object (or replacing an existing one).</li>
</ol>

<p>Example of option 3 (edited to remove use of "new" module -- It's deprecated, I did not know ):</p>

<pre><code>import types
class someclass(object):
    val = "Value"
    def some_method(self):
        print self.val

def some_method_upper(self):
    print self.val.upper()

obj = someclass()
obj.some_method()

obj.some_method = types.MethodType(some_method_upper, obj)
obj.some_method()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Well, classes are first class objects, so you can create them in methods if you want.  e.g.</p>

<pre><code>from optparse import OptionParser
def make_custom_op(i):
  class MyOP(OptionParser):
    def exit(self):
      print 'custom exit called', i
  return MyOP

custom_op_class = make_custom_op(3)
custom_op = custom_op_class()

custom_op.exit()          # prints 'custom exit called 3'
dir(custom_op)            # shows all the regular attributes of an OptionParser
</code></pre>

<p>But, really, why not just define the class at the normal level?  If you need to customise it, put the customisation in as arguments to <code>__init__</code>.</p>

<p>(edit: fixed typing errors in code)</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Python doesn't support this directly (anonymous classes) but because of its terse syntax it isn't really necessary:</p>

<pre><code>class MyOptionParser(OptionParser):
    def exit(self, status=0, msg=None):
        # body of method

p = MyOptionParser()
</code></pre>

<p>The only downside is you add MyOptionParser to your namespace, but as John Fouhy pointed out, you can hide that inside a function if you are going to do it multiple times.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Python probably has better ways to solve your problem. If you could provide more specific details of what you want to do it would help.</p>

<p>For example, if you need to change the method being called in a specific point in code, you can do this by passing the function as a parameter (functions are first class objects in python, you can pass them to functions, etc). You can also create anonymous <code>lambda</code> functions (but they're restricted to a single expression).</p>

<p>Also, since python is very dynamic, you can change methods of an object after it's been created <code>object.method1 = alternative_impl1</code>, although it's actually a bit more complicated, see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/357997/python-does-have-something-like-anonymous-inner-classes-of-java#358055">gnud's answer</a></p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You can use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#type" rel="nofollow"><code>type(name, bases, dict)</code></a> builtin function to create classes on the fly.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>op = type("MyOptionParser", (OptionParser,object), {"foo": lambda self: "foo" })
op().foo()
</code></pre>

<p>Since OptionParser isn't a new-style class, you have to explicitly include <code>object</code> in the list of base classes.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>In python you have anonymous functions, declared using lambda statement. I do not like them very much - they are not so readable, and have limited functionality.</p>

<p>However, what you are talking about may be implemented in python with a completely different approach:</p>

<pre><code>class a(object):
  def meth_a(self):
    print "a"

def meth_b(obj):
  print "b"

b = a()
b.__class__.meth_a = meth_b
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>You can always hide class by variables:</p>

<pre><code> class var(...):
     pass
 var = var()
</code></pre>

<p>instead of</p>

<pre><code> var = new ...() {};
</code></pre>
