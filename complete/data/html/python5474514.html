<h3>Question (ID-5474514):</h3><h2>Use of OR as branch control in FP</h2><p>I undertook an interview last week in which I learnt a few things about python I didn't know about (or rather realise how they could be used), first up and the content of this question is the use of <code>or</code> for the purposes of branch control. </p>

<p>So, for example, if we run:</p>

<pre><code>def f():
    # do something. I'd use ... but that's actually a python object.

def g():
    # something else.

f() or g()
</code></pre>

<p>Then if <code>f()</code> evaluates to some true condition then that value is returned, if not, <code>g()</code> is evaluated and whatever value it produces is returned, whether true or false. This gives us the ability to implement an <code>if</code> statement using <code>or</code> keywords.</p>

<p>We can also use <code>and</code> such that <code>f() and g()</code> will return the value of <code>g()</code> if <code>f()</code> is true and the value of <code>f()</code> if <code>g()</code> is false.</p>

<p>I am told that this (the use of <code>or</code> for branch control) is a common thing in languages such as lisp (hence the lisp tag). I'm currently following <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">SICP</a> learning Scheme, so I can see that <code>(or (f x) (g x))</code> would return the value of <code>(g x)</code> assuming <code>(f x)</code> is <code>#f</code>.</p>

<p>I'm confused as to whether there is any advantage of this technique. It clearly achieves branch control but to me the built in keywords seem more self-explanatory.</p>

<p>I'm also confused as to whether or not this is "functional"? My understanding of pure functional programming is that you use constructs like this (an example from my recent erlang experiments):</p>

<pre><code>makeeven(N,1) -&gt; N+1;
makeeven(N,0) -&gt; N;
makeeven(N)   -&gt; makeeven(N,N rem 2). 
</code></pre>

<p>Or a better, more complicated example using <a href="http://bartoszmilewski.wordpress.com/2009/10/21/what-does-haskell-have-to-do-with-c/">template meta-programming in C++</a> (discovered via cpp-next.com). My thought process is that one aspect of functional programming boils down the use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piecewise">piecewise defined functions in code</a> for branch control (and if you can manage it, tail recursion).</p>

<p>So, my questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is this "functional"? It appears that way and my interviewers said they had backgrounds in functional programming, but it didn't match what I thought was functional. I see no reason why you couldn't have a logical operator as part of a function - it seems to lend itself nicely to the concept of higher order functions. I just hadn't thought that the use of logical operators was how functional programmers achieved branch control. Right? Wrong? I can see that circuits use logic gates for branch control so I guess this is a similar (related) concept?</li>
<li>Is there some advantage to using this technique? Is it just language conciseness/a syntax issue, or are there implications in terms of building an interpreter to using this construct?</li>
<li>Are there any use cases for this technique? Or is it not used very often? Is it used at all? As a self-taught guy I'd never seen it before although that in itself isn't necessarily surprising.</li>
</ul>

<p>I apologise for jumping over so many languages; I'm simply trying to tie together my understanding across them. Feel free to answer in any language mentioned. I also apologise if I've misunderstood any definitions or am missing something vital here, I've never formally studied computer science.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Your interviewers must have had a "functional background" way back.  It used to be common to write</p>

<pre><code>(or (some-condition) (some-side-effect))
</code></pre>

<p>but in CL and in Scheme implementation that support it, it is much better written with <code>unless</code>.  Same goes for <code>and</code> vs <code>when</code>.</p>

<p>So, to be more concrete -- it's not more functional (and in fact the common use of these things was for one-sided conditionals, which are not functional to begin with); there is no advantage (which becomes very obvious in these languages when you know that things are implemented as macros anyway -- for example, most <code>or</code> and <code>and</code> implementations expand to an <code>if</code>); and any possible use cases should use <code>when</code> and <code>unless</code> if you have them in your implementation, otherwise it's better to define them as macros than to not use them.</p>

<p>Oh, and you could use a combination of them instead of a two sided <code>if</code>, but that would be obfuscatingly ugly.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I'm not aware of any issues with the way this code will execute, but it is confusing to read for the uninitiated.  In fact, this kind of syntax is like a Python anti-pattern:  you can do it, but it is in no way Pythonic.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><code>condition and true_branch or false_branch</code> works in all languages that have short circuting logical operators. On the other hand it's not really a good idea to use in a language where values have a boolean value.</p>

<p>For example</p>

<pre><code>zero = (1==0) and 0 or 1   # (1==0) -&gt; False 
zero = (False and 0) or 1  # (False and X) -&gt; X
zero = 0 or 1              # 0 is False in most languages
zero = False or 1 
zero = 1
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>As Eli said; also, performing control flow purely with logical operators tends to be taught in introductory FP classes -- more as a mind exercise, really, not something that you necessarily want to use IRL. It's always good to be able to translate any control operator down to <code>if</code>.</p>

<p>Now, the big difference between FPs and other languages is that, in more functional languages, <code>if</code> is actually an expression, not a statement. An <code>if</code> block <em>always</em> has a value! The C family of languages has a macro version of this -- the <code>test? consequent : alternative</code> construct -- but it gets really unreadable if you nest more expressions.</p>

<p>Prior to Python 2.5, if you want to have a control-flow expression in Python you might have to use logical operators. In Python 2.5, though, there <em>is</em> an FP-like if-expression syntax, so you can do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>(42 if True else 7) + 35
</code></pre>

<p>See <a href="http://docs.python.org/whatsnew/2.5.html" rel="nofollow">PEP 308</a></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You only mention the case where there are exactly 2 expressions to evaluate.  What happens if there are 5?</p>

<pre><code>;; returns first true value, evaluating only as many as needed
(or (f x) (g x) (h x) (i x) (j x))
</code></pre>

<p>Would you nest if-statements?  I'm not sure how I'd do this in Python.  It's <em>almost</em> like this:</p>

<pre><code>any(c(x) for c in [f, g, h, i, j])
</code></pre>

<p>except Python's <code>any</code> throws away the value and just returns <code>True</code>.  (There might be a way to do it with <code>itertools.dropwhile</code>, but it seems a little awkward to me.  Or maybe I'm just missing the obvious way.)</p>

<p>(As an aside: I find that Lisp's builtins don't <em>quite</em> correspond to what their names are in other languages, which can be confusing.  Lisp's <code>IF</code> is like C's ternary operator <code>?:</code> or Python's conditional expressions, for example, not their if-statements.  Likewise, Lisp's <code>OR</code> is in some ways more like (but not exactly like) Python's <code>any()</code>, which only takes 2 expressions.  Since the normal <code>IF</code> returns a value already, there's no point in having a separate kind of "if" that can't be used like this, or a separate kind of "or" that only takes two values.  It's already as flexible as the less common variant in other languages.)</p>

<p>I happen to be writing code like this right now, coincidentally, where some of the functions are "go ask some server for an answer", and I want to stop as soon as I get a positive response.  I'd never use <code>OR</code> where I really want to say <code>IF</code>, but I'd rather say:</p>

<pre><code>(setq did-we-pass (or (try-this x)
                      (try-that x)
                      (try-some-other-thing x)
                      (heck-maybe-this-will-work x))
</code></pre>

<p>than make a big tree of IFs.  Does that qualify as "flow control" or "functional"?  I guess it depends on your definitions.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><ol>
<li><p>It may be considered "functional" in the sense of style of programming that is/was preferred in functional language. There is nothing functional in it otherwise.</p></li>
<li><p>It's just syntax.</p></li>
<li><p>It may be sometimes more readable to use or, for example:</p>

<pre><code>def foo(bar=None):
    bar = bar or []
    ...
    return bar

def baz(elems):
    print "You have %s elements." % (len(elems) or "no")
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>You could use <code>bar if bar else []</code>, but it's quite elaborate.</p>
