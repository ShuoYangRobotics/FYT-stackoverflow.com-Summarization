<h3>Question (ID-5056064):</h3><h2>element that appear more that once in the list in Python</h2><p>Please help (I know that it's a silly question):</p>

<p>I have a list <code>d = [' ABA', ' AAB', ' BAA', ' BAA', ' AAB', ' ABA']</code>. How can I exclude elements that appear more than once?</p>

<pre><code>list(set(d))
</code></pre>

<p>If order matters, you can pass the values through a dict that remembers the original indices. This approach, while expressible as a single expression, is considerably more complicated:</p>

<pre><code>[x for (i, x) in sorted((i, x) for (x, i) in dict((x, i) for (i, x) in reversed(list(enumerate(d)))).iteritems())]
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, you don't have to use comprehensions. For this problem, a fairly simple solution is available:</p>

<pre><code>a = []
for x in d:
    if x not in a:
        a.append(x)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that both the order-preserving solutions assume that you want to keep the first occurrence of each duplicated element.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>To <strong>exclude</strong> items from the list that appear more than once:</p>

<pre><code>d = [x for x in d if d.count(x) == 1]
</code></pre>

<p>For the example provided above, d will bind to an empty list.</p>

<p>Others have posted good solutions to <strong>remove duplicates</strong>.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Lets say you got a list named <code>Words</code> and a list <code>UniqueWords</code>, start a loop on <code>Words</code>, on each iteration you check if the list <code>UniqueWords</code> contains the iterated element, if so then <code>continue</code>, if not then add it to the UniqueWords. In the end you will have a list without duplicates.  Another way you could do is a loop in a loop and instead of adding you'd remove it if it was found more than once :)</p>

<p>I bet there are far more efficient ways though.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>If you're not worried about the order, <code>d = list(set(d)))</code>. </p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>If you shouldn't have done that already, make sure to read <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/itertools.html" rel="nofollow">the python docs on itertools</a>, especially product(), permutations() and combinations().</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>If order matters check out the <code>unique_everseen</code> function in the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/itertools.html#recipes" rel="nofollow">itertools recpies</a> documentation. It give a relatively clean iterator-based solution.</p>

<p>If order doesn't matter, convert to a set.</p>
