<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I found <a href="http://www.ferg.org/thinking%5Fin%5Ftkinter/index.html" rel="nofollow">Thinking in Tkinter</a> very helpful for getting my head around the concepts of GUI programming (notably, packing widgets inside other widgets, and binding callbacks to events).</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>This is what I used: <a href="http://www.pythonware.com/library/tkinter/introduction/" rel="nofollow">Pythonware -- An introduction to TKinter</a>.</p>

<p>I quickly switched to <a href="http://www.qtrac.eu/pyqtbook.html" rel="nofollow">PyQT</a>, though :)</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Mark Lutz's tome <em>Programming Python</em> deals at length with Tkinter. The <em>Introduction to Tkinter</em> ( effbot.org) and <em>Tkinter reference: a GUI for Python</em> (John Shipman, New Mexico Tech) are good summaries of the major features. I have read that the Tk/Tcl manual is a good reference but that might be for later.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Here are several <a href="http://showmedo.com/videotutorials/series?name=pythonShawnTkinterSeries" rel="nofollow">video series</a> on building python GUIs that got me started</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>If you learn best from video, Charlie, I recommend <a href="http://showmedo.com/videotutorials/video?name=pythonShawnTkinter1&amp;fromSeriesID=58" rel="nofollow">http://showmedo.com/videotutorials/video?name=pythonShawnTkinter1&amp;fromSeriesID=58</a> ; if from books, <a href="http://www.manning.com/grayson/" rel="nofollow">http://www.manning.com/grayson/</a> .  For a free online tutorial, I second bedwyr's advice -- and I <em>especially</em> second his (implicit;-) advice to use PyQt instead.  (A web search for pyqt tutorial shows many pointers).</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>You have the source for idle.  That shows useful tkinter code.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>I just came across <a href="http://www.shido.info/py/python6%5Fe.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.shido.info/py/python6_e.html</a> which looks very handy</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>I used Manning's book on Tkinter, as someone else mentioned. The tutorials are very thorough, and you quickly get into the habit of thinking like a GUI coder. The New Mexico Tech worksheet is useful as a reference, but a bit too clumsy for a first resource.</p>
