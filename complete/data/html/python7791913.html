<h3>Question (ID-7791913):</h3><h2>syntaxerror: "unexpected character after line continuation character in python" math</h2><p>I am having problems with this Python program I am creating to do maths, working out and so solutions but I'm getting the syntaxerror: "unexpected character after line continuation character in python"</p>

<p>this is my code</p>

<pre><code>print("Length between sides: "+str((length*length)*2.6)+" \ 1.5 = "+str(((length*length)*2.6)\1.5)+" Units")
</code></pre>

<p>My problem is with <b>\1.5</b> I have tried <b>\1.5</b> but it doesn't work</p>

<p>Using python 2.7.2</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The division operator is <code>/</code>, not <code>\</code></p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The backslash <code>\</code> is the line continuation character the error message is talking about, and after it, only newline characters/whitespace are allowed (before the next non-whitespace continues the "interrupted" line.</p>

<pre><code>print "This is a very long string that doesn't fit" + \
      "on a single line"
</code></pre>

<p>Outside of a string, a backslash can only appear in this way. For division, you want a slash: <code>/</code>.</p>

<p>If you want to write a verbatim backslash in a string, escape it by doubling it: <code>"\\"</code> </p>

<p>In your code, you're using it twice:</p>

<pre><code> print("Length between sides: " + str((length*length)*2.6) +
       " \ 1.5 = " +                   # inside a string; treated as literal
       str(((length*length)*2.6)\1.5)+ # outside a string, treated as line cont
                                       # character, but no newline follows -&gt; Fail
       " Units")
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>The division operator is <code>/</code> rather than <code>\</code>.</p>

<p>Also, the backslash has a special meaning inside a Python string. Either escape it with another backslash:</p>

<pre><code>"\\ 1.5 = "`
</code></pre>

<p>or use a raw string</p>

<pre><code>r" \ 1.5 = "
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Well, what do you try to do? If you want to use division, use "/" not "\".
If it is something else, explain it in a bit more detail, please.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>As the others already mentioned: the division operator is <strong>/</strong> rather than *<em>*</em>.
If you wanna print the *<em>*</em> character within a string you have to escape it:</p>

<pre><code>print("foo \\")
# will print: foo \
</code></pre>

<p>I think to print the string you wanted I think you gonna need this code:</p>

<pre><code>print("Length between sides: " + str((length*length)*2.6) + " \\ 1.5 = " + str(((length*length)*2.6)/1.5) + " Units")
</code></pre>

<p>And this one is a more readable version of the above (using the format method):</p>

<pre><code>message = "Length between sides: {0} \\ 1.5 = {1} Units"
val1 = (length * length) * 2.6
val2 = ((length * length) * 2.6) / 1.5
print(message.format(val1, val2))
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><pre><code>print ("Length between sides: \"+str((length*length)*2.6)+\" \ 1.5 = \"+str(((length*length)*2.6)\1.5)+\" Units")
</code></pre>

<p>This works for me.. if it's a string u want to print..</p>
