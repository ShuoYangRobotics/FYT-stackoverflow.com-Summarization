<h3>Question (ID-1377429):</h3><h2>What is faster in Python, "while" or "for xrange"</h2><p>We can do numeric iteration like:</p>

<pre><code>for i in xrange(10):
    print i,
</code></pre>

<p>and in C-style:</p>

<pre><code>i = 0
while i &lt; 10:
    print i,
    i = i + 1
</code></pre>

<p>Yes, I know, the first one is less error-prone, more pythonic but is it fast enough as C-style version?</p>

<p>PS. I'm from C++ planet and pretty new on Python one.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Who cares? Seriously. If you want to know, use timeit package (you can invoke it from command line with -m).</p>

<p>But it doesn't matter at all, because the difference is negligible. And in general, Python is not a language that you choose if you want speed.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I am sure the <code>while</code> version is slower. Python will have to lookup the add operation for the integer object on each turn of the loop etc, it is not pure C just because it looks like it!</p>

<p>And if you want a pythonic version of exactly the above, use:</p>

<pre><code>print " ".join(str(i) for i in xrange(10))
</code></pre>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>Edit: My timings look like this. This is just a silly running loop without printing, just to show you what writing out "i += 1" etc costs in Python.</p>

<pre><code>$ python -mtimeit "i=0" "while i &lt; 1000: i+=1"
1000 loops, best of 3: 303 usec per loop
$ python -mtimeit "for i in xrange(1000): pass"
10000 loops, best of 3: 120 usec per loop
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>The first one.</p>

<p>You mean, faster to develop, right?</p>

<p>PS: It doesn't matter, machines these days are so fast that it is meaningless to ponder on micro optimizations, prior to identifying the bottlenecks using a thorough profiler.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>They are <strong>both</strong> to avoid :-)</p>

<p>Generally speaking, each time I see an iteration over numbers, I see some non-pythonic code, that could be expressed in a better way using iterations over lists or generators.<br />
Actually, I've said "pythonic", but it is all about <strong>readability</strong>. Using idiomatic code will increase readability, and ultimately also performance, because the compiler will better know how to optimize it.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Well, if you are after efficiency in numerical code, you ought to use <a href="http://numpy.scipy.org" rel="nofollow" title="numpy">numpy</a> and <a href="http://www.scipy.org" rel="nofollow" title="scipy">scipy</a>. Your integration can be quickly written as <code>numpy.sum( numpy.arange( 10 ) )</code></p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>If your program is too slow, try using <a href="http://psyco.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">psyco</a>.</p>

<p>Don't worry about the kind of micro-optimisation in your question.  Write your program to be maintainable (which includes following standard Python style so other programmers can read it easier).</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>In Python, the shorter and clearer version is always better. If I am not mistaken the range and xrange functions are not native, if you try xrange(sys.maxint+1) you will get an overflow error.</p>

<p>Besides, what the hell could this be useful for? If you are just printing 10 numbers, then surely readability counts a thousand times more - and I don't think you're going to print over a million numbers...</p>
