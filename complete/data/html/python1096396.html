<h3>Question (ID-1096396):</h3><h2>What is the easiest way to handle dates/times in Python?</h2><p>My use case is that I'm just making a website that I want people all over the world to be able to use, and I want to be able to say things like "This happened at 5:33pm on October 5" and also "This happened 5 minutes ago," etc.</p>

<p>Should I use the datetime module? 
Or just strftime?
Or something fancier that isn't part of the std distro of Python?</p>

<p><a href="http://labix.org/python-dateutil" rel="nofollow">http://labix.org/python-dateutil</a></p>

<p>It's good at doing the types of things you're looking for - see some of the examples in the documentation.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You may have a look at Django's <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/humanize/#ref-contrib-humanize" rel="nofollow">humanize module</a>.<br />
It is part of Django, but I think it would be quite easy to adapt it to your needs.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If you're going to use <code>datetime</code>, make sure you read this recent and most excellent article:
 <a href="http://www.enricozini.org/2009/debian/using-python-datetime/" rel="nofollow">Tips on using python's datetime module</a>. <code>datetime</code> will take care of most of the niceties of handling time arithmetic, but it won't give you the English-language pretty printing you're looking for.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The datetime module in Python will allow you to get/set/manipulate dates and times. 
A question about relative date formatting in Python has already been asked: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/410221/natural-relative-days-in-python">Stack Overflow Post</a>
but with very little responce. </p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Try <a href="http://jehiah.cz/archive/printing-relative-dates-in-python" rel="nofollow">relativeDates Module</a> module. It exactly brings you the stuff you wanted.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I have always been very happy using the datetime package. You get a lot of stuff for free, and it's pretty easy to create datetime objects as well, calculate duration ect.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>There is also the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/time.html" rel="nofollow">Time module</a>.</p>
