<h3>Question (ID-407734):</h3><h2>A generic priority queue for Python</h2><p>I need to use a priority queue in my Python code. Looking around for something efficient, I came upon <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/heapq.html" rel="nofollow">heapq</a>. It looks good, but seems to be specified only for integers. I suppose it works with any objects that have comparison operators, but it doesn't specify what comparison operators it needs. </p>

<p>Besides, <code>heapq</code> seems to be implemented in Python, so it's not fast.</p>

<p>Are you aware of any fast implementations for priority queues in Python ? Optimally, I'd like the queue to be generic (i.e. work well for any object with a specified comparison operator).</p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>Re comparison in <code>heapq</code>, I can either use a <code>(priority, object)</code> as Charlie Martin suggests, or just implement <code>__cmp__</code> for my object. </p>

<p>I'm still looking for something faster than <code>heapq</code>.</p>

Recall that Python isn't strongly typed, so you can save anything you like: just make a tuple of (priority,thing) and you're set.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>How do you know it's too slow? Have you profiled it yet? Also since 2.4, there's a C implementation of heapq in the standard library which is used.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Did you look at the <a href="http://docs.python.org/_sources/library/heapq.txt" rel="nofollow">"Show Source" link</a> on the heapq page? There's an example a little less than halfway down of using a heap with a list of (int, char) tuples as a priority queue.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I've not used it, but you could try <a href="http://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dyoo/python/" rel="nofollow">PyHeap</a>. It's written in C so hopefully it is fast enough for you. </p>

<p>Are you positive heapq/PriorityQueue won't be fast enough? It might be worth going with one of them to start, and then profiling to see if it really is your performance bottlneck.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I ended up implementing a wrapper for <code>heapq</code>, adding a dict for maintaining the queue's elements unique. The result should be quite efficient for all operators:</p>

<pre><code>class PriorityQueueSet(object):
    """ Combined priority queue and set data structure. Acts like
        a priority queue, except that its items are guaranteed to
        be unique.

        Provides O(1) membership test, O(log N) insertion and 
        O(log N) removal of the smallest item.

        Important: the items of this data structure must be both
        comparable and hashable (i.e. must implement __cmp__ and
        __hash__). This is true of Python's built-in objects, but
        you should implement those methods if you want to use
        the data structure for custom objects.
    """
    def __init__(self, items=[]):
        """ Create a new PriorityQueueSet.

            items:
                An initial item list - it can be unsorted and 
                non-unique. The data structure will be created in
                O(N).
        """
        self.set = dict((item, True) for item in items)
        self.heap = self.set.keys()
        heapq.heapify(self.heap)

    def has_item(self, item):
        """ Check if *item* exists in the queue
        """
        return item in self.set

    def pop_smallest(self):
        """ Remove and return the smallest item from the queue
        """

        del self.set[smallest]
        return smallest

    def add(self, item):
        """ Add *item* to the queue. The item will be added only
            if it doesn't already exist in the queue.

        if not (item in self.set):
            self.set[item] = True

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You can use heapq for non-integer elements (tuples)</p>

<pre><code>from heapq import *

heap = []
data = [(10,"ten"), (3,"three"), (5,"five"), (7,"seven"), (9, "nine"), (2,"two")]
for item in data:
    heappush(heap, item)
sorted = []
while heap:
    sorted.append(heappop(heap))
print sorted
data.sort()
print data == sorted
