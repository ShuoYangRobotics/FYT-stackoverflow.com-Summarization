<h3>Question (ID-327776):</h3><h2>Read the last lineof the file</h2><p>Imagine I have a file with </p>

<p>Xpto,50,30,60
Xpto,a,v,c
Xpto,1,9,0
Xpto,30,30,60</p>

<p>that txt file can be appended a lot of times and when I open the file I want only to get the values of the last line of the txt file... How can i do that on python? reading the last line?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you're on a unix box,
  <code>os.popen("tail -10 " +
  filepath).readlines()</code> will probably
  be the fastest way.  Otherwise, it 
  depends on how robust you want it to
  be.  The methods proposed so far will
  all fall down, one way or another. 
  For robustness and speed in the most
  common case you probably want
  something like a logarithmic search:
  use file.seek to go to end of the file
  minus 1000 characters, read it in,
  check how many lines it contains, then
  to EOF minus 3000 characters, read in
  2000 characters, count the lines, then
  EOF minus 7000, read in 4000
  characters, count the lines, etc.
  until you have as many lines as you
  need.  But if you know for sure that
  it's always going to be run on files
  with sensible line lengths, you may
  not need that.</p>

  <code>tail</code> command.</p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I prefer to treat file lines with</p>

<p>for Line in inFile:</p>

<pre><code> last_one = Line.split(",")
</code></pre>

<p>so there is any chance my for goes until the last Line and only split the last line of my file? </p>

<p>I need something very easy.</p>

<p>thanks</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p><code>f.seek( pos ,2)</code> seeks to 'pos' relative to the end of the file.
try a reasonable value for pos then readlines() and get the last line.</p>

<p>You have to account for when 'pos' is not a good guess, i.e. suppose you choose 300, but the last line is 600 chars long! in that case, just try again with a reasonable guess, until you capture the entire line. (this worst case should be very rare)</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Not sure about a python specific implementation, but in a more language agnostic fashion, what you would want to do is skip (seek) to the end of the file, and then read each character in backwards order until you reach the line feed character that your file is using, usually a character with value 13.  just read forward from that point to the end of the file, and you will have the last line in the file.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>is your file really so huge that you can't just read the whole file and discard all but the last line?  KISS</p>
