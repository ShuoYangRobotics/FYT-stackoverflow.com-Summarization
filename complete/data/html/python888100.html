<h3>Question (ID-888100):</h3><h2>Why python compile the source to bytecode before interpreting?</h2><p>Why python compile the source to bytecode before interpreting?</p>

<p>Why not interpret from the source directly?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Nearly no interpreter really interprets code <em>directly</em>, line by line â€“ it's simply too inefficient. Almost all interpreters use some intermediate representation which can be executed easily. Also, small optimizations can be performed on this intermediate code.</p>

<p>Python furthermore stores this code which has a huge advantage for the next time this code gets executed: Python doesn't have to parse the code anymore; parsing is the slowest part in the compile process. Thus, a bytecode representation reduces execution overhead quite substantially.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Because interpretting from bytecode directly is faster.  It avoids the need to do lexing, for one thing.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Because you can compile to a <code>.pyc</code> once and interpret from it many times.</p>

<p>So if you're running a script many times you only have the overhead of parsing the source code once.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Re-lexing and parsing the source code over and over, rather than doing it just once (most often on the first <code>import</code>), would obviously be a silly and pointless waste of effort.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Although there is a small efficiency aspect to it (you can store the bytecode on disk or in memory), its mostly engineering: it allows you separate parsing from interpreting. Parsers can often be nasty creatures, full of edge-cases and having to conform to esoteric rules like using just the right amount of lookahead and resolving shift-reduce problems. By contrast, interpreting is really simple: its just a big switch statement using the bytecode's opcode.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I doubt very much that the reason is performance, albeit be it a nice side effect. I would say that it's only natural to think a VM built around some high-level assembly language would be more practical than to find and replace text in some source code string.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Okay, clearly, who ever put a -1 vote on my post without leaving a reasonable comment to explain knows very little about virtual machines (run-time environments).</p>
