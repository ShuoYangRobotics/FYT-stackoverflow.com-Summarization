<h3>Question (ID-5995485):</h3><h2>Backpropagation through time</h2><p>Does anyone know of a library with a working implementation of backpropagation through time?
Any of Java/Python/C#/VB.NET/F# (preferably the last one) will do!</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Assuming you're already using some library for BP, it should be (TM) rather straightforward to implement BPTT using BP as a step in the process.</p>

<p>The Wikipedia entry for BPTT [1] includes relevant pseudo code. </p>

<p>My own starting point, about 18 years ago, was "The Truck Backer-Upper: An Example of Self-Learning in Neural Networks" [2].</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I've used <a href="http://neurondotnet.freehostia.com/manual/index.html" rel="nofollow">NeuronDotNet</a> only for a limited time though.  It allows you to create a feed-forward BackPropagation NN.  I especially liked their use of intuitively named classes.  Good luck!</p>

<p>This is a .net library.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I'm from a Java background but <a href="http://www.heatonresearch.com/encog" rel="nofollow">Encog</a> has a .net implementation as well (and is a seriously good framework for NNets, with good time series support)</p>

<p>Can't help with an F# framework, but what domain are you coding for?  If it's finance I'll reassert the "take a look at Encog"</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Perhaps <a href="http://pybrain.org/" rel="nofollow">pybrain</a> would do?  The docstring for its <code>BackpropTrainer</code> class suggests that it does backpropagation through time:</p>

<pre><code>class BackpropTrainer(Trainer):
    """Trainer that trains the parameters of a module according to a
    supervised dataset (potentially sequential) by backpropagating the errors
    (through time)."""
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>What about <a href="http://snarli.sourceforge.net/docs/edu/wlu/cs/levy/SNARLI/BPLayer.html" rel="nofollow">this one</a> ? Just a Google search to help...</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I've had good experiences with <a href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/" rel="nofollow">Weka</a> - In my view one of the best and almost certainly the most comprehensive general purpose machine learning libraries around.  </p>

<p>You could certainly do BPTT with Weka - you may find a ready made classifier that does what you need but even if not you can just chain a few normal backpropagation units together as per the very good <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation_through_time" rel="nofollow">wikipedia article on BPTT</a></p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I made backpropagation algorithm in Java quite time ago. I uploaded it into GitHub, maybe you can find it useful: <a href="https://github.com/bernii/NeuralNetwokPerceptronKohonen" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/bernii/NeuralNetwokPerceptronKohonen</a></p>

<p>Let me now if it was helpful :)</p>
