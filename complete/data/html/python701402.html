<h3>Question (ID-701402):</h3><h2>Best way to choose a random file from a directory</h2><p>What is the best way to choose a random file from a directory in Python?</p>

<p><em>Edit:</em> Here is what I am doing:</p>

<pre><code>import os
import random
import dircache

dir = 'some/directory'
filename = random.choice(dircache.listdir(dir))
path = os.path.join(dir, filename)
</code></pre>

<p>Is this particularly bad, or is there a particularly better way?</p>

random.choice(os.listdir("C:\\")) #change dir name to whatever
</code></pre>

<p>Regarding your edited question: first, I assume you know the risks of using a <code>dircache</code>, as well as the fact that it is <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/dircache.html" rel="nofollow">deprecated since 2.6, and removed in 3.0</a>.</p>

<p>Second of all, I don't see where any race condition exists here. Your <code>dircache</code> object is basically immutable (after directory listing is cached, it is never read again), so no harm in concurrent reads from it.</p>

<p>Other than that, I do not understand why you see any problem with this solution. It is fine.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Language agnostic solution:</p>

<p>1) Get the total no. of files in specified directory.</p>

<p>2) Pick a random number from 0 to [total no. of files - 1].</p>

<p>3) Get the list of filenames as a suitably indexed collection or such.</p>

<p>4) Pick the nth element, where n is the random number.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Independant from the language used, you can read all references to the files in a directory into a datastructure like an array (something like 'listFiles'), get the length of the array. calculate a random number in the range of '0' to 'arrayLength-1' and access the file at the certain index. This should work, not only in python.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>If you don't know before hand what files are there, you will need to get a list, then just pick a random index in the list.</p>

<p>Here's one attempt:</p>

<pre><code>import os
import random

def getRandomFile(path):
  """
  Returns a random filename, chosen among the files of the given path.
  """
  files = os.listdir(path)
  index = random.randrange(0, len(files))
  return files[index]
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: The question now mentions a fear of a "race condition", which I can only assume is the typical problem of files being added/removed while you are in the process of trying to pick a random file.</p>

<p>I don't believe there is a way around that, other than keeping in mind that any I/O operation is inherently "unsafe", i.e. it can fail. So, the algorithm to open a randomly chosen file in a given directory should:</p>

<ul>
<li>Actually <code>open()</code> the file selected, and handle a failure, since the file might no longer be there</li>
<li>Probably limit itself to a set number of tries, so it doesn't die if the directory is empty or if none of the files are readable</li>
</ul>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>If you want directories included, Yuval A's answer. Otherwise:</p>

<pre><code>import os, random

random.choice([x for x in os.listdir("C:\\") if os.path.isfile(os.path.join("C:\\", x))])
</code></pre>
