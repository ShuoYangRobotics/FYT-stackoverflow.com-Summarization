<h3>Question (ID-1872261):</h3><h2>While loop example</h2><pre><code>x = y // 2  # For some y &gt; 1
while x &gt; 1:
   if y % x == 0: # Remainder 
      print(y, 'has factor', x) 
      break  # Skip else
   x -= 1 
else: # Normal exit
   print(y, 'is prime')
</code></pre>

<p>This is an example for understanding while loop in a book I'm reading, I don't quite understand why a floor division and then y % x? Can someone please explain this piece of code, whats it doing?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>% is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo%5Foperation" rel="nofollow">mod operator</a>. It performs division and returns the remainder rather than the result of the division. For example, 5 // 2 == 2, and 5 % 2 == 1.</p>

<p>Commented:</p>

<pre><code>x = y // 2  # For some y &gt; 1  ##Reduce search space to half of y
while x &gt; 1:
  if y % x == 0: # Remainder  ##If x divides y cleanly (4 / 2 == 2)
    print(y, 'has factor', x) ##y is not prime
    break  # Skip else        ##Exit the loop
  x -= 1   # Normal exit  ##Try the next value
else:
  print(y, 'is prime')

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>the logic is:</p>

<p>if y modulo x is 0, it means that x is a dividor of y, so y has a factor. print that, and break out of the loop.</p>

<p>if not, decrease x by 1, and try again.</p>

<p>but some things are broken in this code:</p>

<ol>
<li>the else statement position</li>
<li>the fact the 'print y is prime' is after the loop - it will always print it. </li>
</ol>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>The program prints at least one factor of an integer y, or if it has no factors (other than itself and 1), prints that y is prime.</p>

<p>It uses the variable x to try all possible factors greater than one.  It starts at the floor of y divided by 2, because no number larger than half of y could be a factor.  Using normal division rather than floor division could give you a fractional value if y is odd.  (An even better solution is to start with the square root of y - if y is not prime, one of its factors will be less than or equal to its square root.)</p>

<p>Inside the loop, it tests y % x, which is the remainder after dividing y by x.  If the remainder is zero, that means that x is a factor of y, and it prints it.</p>

<p>The else clause is executed at the end of the loop, unless a factor is found, in which case the "break" skips out of the loop and the else clause.  So either a factor is found, or it's prime.</p>

<p>Here's the improved code with the indentation fixed:</p>

<pre><code>import math

def check_primality(y):
  x = int(math.sqrt(y))
  while x &gt; 1:
    if y % x == 0:                                                
      print y, 'has factor', x
      break
    x -= 1
  else:
    print y, 'is prime'
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The code simply checks if the square root of x has been reached. Note that you can check the primality of a number by checking if the integers from 2 up to the square root of x divides x perfectly (without a remainder).</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>For any number (x) which is not prime, there would be a factor greater than 1 and less than (x/2). 
9 = 3*3
The logic is to iterate through all the numbers &lt;= x/2 and check if the number divides.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I think the program tries to find the biggest prime factors of y.
If y is a prime factor it prints this as well.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p><code>x = y // 2</code> is for testing the numbers in the range x: <code>2..y/2</code>.<br>
A better approach would be to test only the numbers x: <code>2..sqrt(y)</code></p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>the % denotes a modulus which gives you the remainder of division...</p>

<p>and this code checks for prime Y and also checks if Y is a multiplier of x...</p>

<p>x = y // 2     #x=the division or modulus of y , 2</p>

<p>while x > 1:  #you want to check if this is a division result or a modulus</p>

<p>if y % x == 0:  # if y is a multiplier of x </p>

<pre><code>  print(y, 'has factor', x) 

  break  # break the while loop

x -= 1 # decreament x
</code></pre>

<p>else: # this line executes if the wihle reached x > 1 and didnt break 
    print(y, 'is prime')</p>

<p>so if y is a multiplier of x it will decreament x and the loop continue
otherwise it will print y is prime</p>
