<h3>Question (ID-6793872):</h3><h2>Variable assignment and modification (in python)</h2><p>When I ran this script (Python v2.6):</p>

<pre><code>a = [1,2]
b = a
a.append(3)
print a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [1,2,3]
print b
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [1,2,3]
</code></pre>

<p>I expected <code>print b</code> to output <code>[1,2]</code>. Why did b get changed when all I did was change a? Is b permanently tied to a? If so, can I make them independant? How?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Objects in Python are stored by reference—you aren't assigning the value of <code>a</code> to <code>b</code>, but a pointer to the object that <code>a</code> is pointing to.</p>

<p>To emulate assignation by value, you can make a copy like so: </p>

<pre><code>import copy

b = copy.copy(a)

# now the code works as "expected"
</code></pre>

<p>Be aware this has performance disadvantages.</p>

<p>In the case of an array, there's a special method that relies on slices:</p>

<pre><code>b = a[:]

# code also works as expected here
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><em>Update</em>– In addition to this, with some objects you can use the constructor—this includes lists:</p>

<pre><code>b = list(a)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Memory management in Python involves a private heap memory location containing all Python objects and data structures.</p>

<p>Python's runtime only deals in references to objects (which all live in the heap): what goes on Python's stack are always references to values that live elsewhere.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1, 2]
</code></pre>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; b = a
</code></pre>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/01ufg.png" alt="python variables"></p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a.append(3)
</code></pre>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/3HsUL.png" alt="python variables"></p>

<p>Here we can clearly see that the variable <code>b</code> is bound to the same object as <code>a</code>.</p>

<p>You can use the <code>is</code> operator to tests if two objects are physically the same, that means if they have the same address in memory. This can also be tested also using the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#id" rel="nofollow"><code>id()</code></a> function.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a is b
&gt;&gt;&gt; True
&gt;&gt;&gt; id(a) == id(b)
&gt;&gt;&gt; True
</code></pre>

<p>So, in this case, <strong>you must explicitly ask for a copy</strong>.
Once you've done that, there will be no more connection between the two distinct list objects.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; b = list(a)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a is b
&gt;&gt;&gt; False
</code></pre>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You might want to look at <a href="http://henry.precheur.org/python/copy_list" rel="nofollow">this</a> link. The problem you have here is <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> both point to the same memory location, so changing one changes the other. Instead, you want to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>a = [1,2]
b = list(a)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Short answer - Pointers.</p>

<p>When you type <code>b = a</code> it is setting <code>b</code> to look at the same array that <code>a</code> looks at.  You have to make a new array with copies of the elements to separate them.  In this case, something like <code>b = [n for n in a]</code> would work fine.  For more complex operations you may want to check out <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/copy.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/library/copy.html</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p><code>a</code> is a pointer to the list <code>[1,2]</code>.</p>

<p>When you do the assignment <code>b = a</code> the value of b is the address of the list <code>[1,2]</code>.</p>

<p>So when you do <code>a.append(3)</code> you are not actually changing <code>a</code>, you are changing the list that <code>a</code> points to. Since <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> both point to the same list, they both appear to change when you modify the other.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>If you simply want to copy the contents of list a to b, instead of making b a pointer to a:</p>

<pre><code>b = a[:]
</code></pre>

<p>Using the slice operator will copy the contents of the list into b such that you example would become:</p>

<pre><code>a = [1,2]
b = a[:]
a.append(3)
print a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [1,2,3]
print b
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [1,2]
</code></pre>
