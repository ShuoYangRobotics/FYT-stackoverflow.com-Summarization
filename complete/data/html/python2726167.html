<h3>Question (ID-2726167):</h3><h2>Parse a CSV file using python (to make a decision tree later)</h2><p>First off, full disclosure: This is going towards a uni assignment, so I don't want to receive code.  :).  I'm more looking for approaches; I'm <em>very</em> new to python, having read a book but not yet written any code.</p>

<p>The entire task is to import the contents of a CSV file, create a decision tree from the contents of the CSV file (using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3_algorithm" rel="nofollow">ID3 algorithm</a>), and then parse a second CSV file to run against the tree.  There's a big (understandable) preference to have it capable of dealing with different CSV files (I asked if we were allowed to hard code the column names, mostly to eliminate it as a possibility, and the answer was no).</p>

<p>The CSV files are in a fairly standard format; the header row is marked with a # then the column names are displayed, and every row after that is a simple series of values.  Example:</p>

<pre><code># Column1, Column2, Column3, Column4
Value01, Value02, Value03, Value04
Value11, Value12, Value13, Value14
</code></pre>

<p>At the moment, I'm trying to work out the first part: parsing the CSV.  To make the decisions for the decision tree, a dictionary structure seems like it's going to be the most logical; so I was thinking of doing something along these lines:</p>

<pre><code>Read in each line, character by character
If the character is not a comma or a space
    Append character to temporary string
If the character is a comma
    Append the temporary string to a list
    Empty string
Once a line has been read
    Create a dictionary using the header row as the key (somehow!)
    Append that dictionary to a list
</code></pre>

<p>However, if I do things that way, I'm not sure how to make a mapping between the keys and the values.  I'm also wondering whether there is some way to perform an action on every dictionary in a list, since I'll need to be doing things to the effect of "Everyone return their values for columns Column1 and Column4, so I can count up who has what!" - I assume that there is some mechanism, but I don't think I know how to do it.</p>

<p>Is a dictionary the best way to do it?  Would I be better off doing things using some other data structure?  If so, what?</p>

<pre>
with open(name_of_file,"r") as file:
    for line in file:
         # process the line
</pre>

<p>You can use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/string.html#string.split" rel="nofollow">string.split</a> function to separate the line along commas, and you can use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/string.html#string.strip" rel="nofollow">string.strip</a> to eliminate intervening whitespace. Python has very powerful <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists" rel="nofollow">lists</a> and <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries" rel="nofollow">dictionaries</a>.</p>

<p>To create a list, you simply use empty brackets like [], while to create an empty dictionary you use {}:</p>

<pre>
mylist = []; # Creates an empty list
mydict = {}; # Creates an empty dictionary
</pre>

<p>You can insert into the list using the .append() function, while you can use indexing subscripts to insert into the dictionary. For example, you can use <code>mylist.append(5)</code> to add 5 to the list, while you can use <code>mydict[key]=value</code> to associate the key <code>key</code> with the value <code>value</code>. To test whether a key is present in the dictionary, you can use the <code>in</code> keyword. For example:</p>

<pre>
if key in mydict:
   print "Present"
else:
   print "Absent"
</pre>

<p>To iterate over the contents of a list or dictionary, you can simply use a for-loop as in:</p>

<pre>
for val in mylist:
    # do something with val

for key in mydict:
    # do something with key or with mydict[key]
</pre>

<p>Since, in many cases, it is necessary to have both the value and index when iterating over a list, there is also a builtin function called enumerate that saves you the trouble of counting indices yourself:</p>

<pre>
for idx, val in enumerate(mylist):
    # do something with val or with idx. Note that val=mylist[idx]
</pre>

<p>The code above is identical in function to:</p>

<pre>
idx=0
for val in mylist:
   # process val, idx
   idx += 1
</pre>

<p>You could also iterate over the indices if you so chose:</p>

<pre>
for idx in xrange(len(mylist)):
    # Do something with idx and possibly mylist[idx]
</pre>

<p>Also, you can get the number of elements in a list or the number of keys in a dictionary using <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#len" rel="nofollow">len</a>.</p>

<p>It is possible to perform an operation on each element of a dictionary or list via the use of list comprehension; however, I would recommend that you simply use for-loops to accomplish that task. But, as an example:</p>

<pre>
>>> list1 = range(10)
>>> list1
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
>>> list2 = [2*x for x in list1]
>>> list2
[0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]
</pre>

<p>When you have the time, I suggest you read the <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/" rel="nofollow">Python tutorial</a> to get some more in-depth knowledge.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Example using the <code>csv</code> module from <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/csv.html#examples" rel="nofollow">docs.python.org</a>:</p>

<pre><code>import csv
reader = csv.reader(open("some.csv", "rb"))
for row in reader:
    print row
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of <code>print</code>ing the rows, you could just save each row into a list, and then process it in the ID3 later.</p>

<pre><code>database.append(row)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Short answer: don't waste time and mental energy (1) reimplementing the built-in csv module (2) reading the csv module's source (it's written in C) -- <strong>just USE it!</strong></p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Look at csv.DictReader.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>import csv
reader = csvDictReader(open('my_file.csv','rb') # 'rb' = read binary
for d in reader:
    print d # this will print out a dictionary with keys equal to the first row of the file.
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Take a look at the built-in <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow">CSV module</a>. Though you probably can't just use it, you can take a sneak peek at the code...</p>

<p>If that's a no-no, your (pseudo)code looks perfectly fine, though you should make use of the <code>str.split()</code> function and use that, reading the file line-by-line.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><h1>Parse the CSV correctly</h1>

<p>I'd avoid using str.split() to parse the fields because str.split() will not recognize quoted values.  And many real-world CSV files use quotes.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values</a></p>

<p>Example record using quoted values:</p>

<pre><code>1997,Ford,E350,"Super, luxurious truck"
</code></pre>

<p>If you use str.split(), you'll get a record like this with 5 fields:</p>

<pre><code>('1997', 'Ford', 'E350', '"Super', ' luxurious truck"')
</code></pre>

<p>But what you really want are records like this with 4 fields:</p>

<pre><code>('1997', 'Ford', 'E350', 'Super, luxurious truck')
</code></pre>

<p>Also, besides commas being in the data, you may have to deal with newlines "\r\n" or just "\n" in the data.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>1997,Ford,E350,"Super
luxurious truck"
1997,Ford,E250,"Ok? Truck"
</code></pre>

<p>So be careful using:</p>

<pre><code>file = open('filename.csv', 'r')
for line in file:
    # problem here, "line" may contain partial data
</code></pre>

<p>Also, like John mentioned, the CSV standard is, that in quotes, if you get a double-double quote, then it turns into one quote.</p>

<pre><code>1997,Ford,E350,"Super ""luxurious"" truck"

('1997', 'Ford', 'E350', 'Super "luxurious" truck')
</code></pre>

<p>So I'd suggest to modify your finite state machine like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Parse each character at a time.
<li>Check to see if it's a quote, then set the state to "in quote"
<li>If "in quote", store all the characters in the current field until there's another quote.
<li>If "in quote", and there's another quote, store the quote character in the field data. (not the end, because a blank field shouldn't be `data,"",data` but instead `data,,data`)
<li>If not "in quote", store the characters until you find a comma or newline.
<li>If comma, save field and start a new field.
<li>If newline, save field, save record, start a new record and a new field.
</ul>

<p>On a side note, interestingly, I've never seen a header commented out using # in a CSV.  So to me, that would imply that you may have to look for commented lines in the data too.  Using # to comment out a line in a CSV file is not standard.</p>

<h1>Adding found fields into a record dictionary using header keys</h1>

<p>Depending on memory requirements, if the CSV is small enough (maybe 10k to 100k records), using a dictionary is fine.  Just store a <code>list</code> of all the column names so you can access the column name by index (or number).  Then in the finite state machine, increment the column index when you find a comma, and reset to 0 when you find a newline.</p>

<p>So if your header is <code>header = ['Column1', 'Column2']</code>  Then when you find a data character, add it like this:</p>

<pre><code>record[header[column_index]] += character
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I don't know too much about the builtin csv module that @Kaloyan Todorov talks about, but, if you're reading comma separated lines, then you can easily do this:</p>

<pre><code>for line in file:
    columns = line.split(',')
    for column in columns:
        print column.strip()
</code></pre>

<p>This will print all the entries of each line without the leading a tailing whitespaces.</p>
