<h3>Question (ID-6392773):</h3><h2>Change string value by function</h2><p>Maybe a silly question but I noticed that my code has many statements like this:</p>

<pre><code>var = "some_string"
var = some_func(var)
var = another_func(var)
print var # outputs "modified_string"
</code></pre>

<p>It's really annoying me, it's just look awful (in the opposite of whole python)
How to avoid using that and start using it in way like this:</p>

<pre><code>var = "some_string"
modify(var, some_func)
modify(var, another_func)
print var # outputs "modified_string"
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you in advance</p>

I guess I understand why they didn't... But hey, that doesn't mean we can't make one ourselves:</p>

<pre><code>def compose(f1, f2):
    def composition(*args, **kwargs):
        return f1(f2(*args, **kwargs))
    return composition

def compose_many(*funcs):
    if len(funcs) == 1:
        return funcs[0]
    if len(funcs) == 2:
        return compose(funcs[0], funcs[1])
    else:
        return compose(funcs[0], compose_many(*funcs[1:]))
</code></pre>

<p>Tested:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def append_foo(s):
...     return s + ' foo'
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; def append_bar(s):
...     return s + ' bar'
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; append_bar(append_foo('my'))
'my foo bar'
&gt;&gt;&gt; compose(append_bar, append_foo)('my')
'my foo bar'
&gt;&gt;&gt; def append_baz(s):
...     return s + ' baz'
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; compose_many(append_baz, append_bar, append_foo)('my')
'my foo bar baz'
</code></pre>

<p>Come to think of it, this probably isn't the best solution to your problem. But it was fun to write.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>This question has been already asked and has quite a nice answear: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/986006/python-how-do-i-pass-a-variable-by-reference">Python: How do I pass a variable by reference?</a></p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>the others already explained why that's not possible, but you could:</p>

<pre><code>for modify in some_func, other_func, yet_another_func:
 var = modify(var)
</code></pre>

<p>or as pst said:</p>

<pre><code>var = yet_another_func(other_func(some_func(var)))
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Strings are immutable in python, so your second example can't work. In the first example you are binding the name <code>var</code> to a completely new object on each line.</p>

<p>Typically multiple assignments to a single name like that are a code smell. Perhaps if you posted a larger sample of code someone here could show you a better way?</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I'm just gonna put this right here (since none of the answers seem to have addressed it yet)</p>

<p>If you're commonly repeating the same sequences of functions, consider wrapping them in a higher level function:</p>

<pre><code>def metafunc(var):
    var = somefunc(var)
    var = otherfunc(var)
    var = thirdfunc(var)
    return lastfunc(var)
</code></pre>

<p>Then when you call the function <code>metafunc</code> you know exactly what's happening to your <code>var</code>: nothing. All you get out of the function call is whatever <code>metafunc</code> returns.
Additionally you can be certain that nothing is happening in parts of your program that you forgot about. This is really important especially in scripting languages where there's usually a lot going on behind the scenes that you <strong>don't</strong> know about/remember.</p>

<p>There are benefits and drawbacks to this, the theoretical discussion is under the category of pure functional programming. Some real-world interactions (such as i/o operations) require non-pure functions because they need real-world implications beyond the scope of your code's execution.
The principle behind this is defined briefly here:</p>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>The problem is that <code>str</code>, <code>int</code> and <code>float</code> (<code>long</code> too, if you're in Py 2.x (True and False are really <code>int</code>s, so them too)) are what you call 'immutable types' in Python. That means that you can't modify their internal states: all manipulations of an <code>str</code> (or <code>int</code> or <code>float</code>) will result in a <em>"new"</em> instance of the <code>str</code> (or whatever) while the old value will remain in Python's cache until the next garbage collection cycle.</p>

<p>Basically, there's nothing you can do. Sorry.</p>
