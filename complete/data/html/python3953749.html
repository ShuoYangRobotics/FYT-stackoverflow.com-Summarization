<h3>Question (ID-3953749):</h3><h2>Python Fibonacci Generator</h2><p>I need to make a program that asks for the amount of fibonacci numbers printed and then prints them like 0, 1, 1, 2... but I cant get it to work. My code looks the following:</p>

<pre><code>a = int(raw_input('Give amount: '))

def fib():
    a, b = 0, 1
    while 1:
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

a = fib()
a.next()
0
for i in range(a):
    print a.next(),
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You are giving <code>a</code> too many meanings:</p>

<pre><code>a = int(raw_input('Give amount: '))
</code></pre>

<p>vs.</p>

<pre><code>a = fib()       
</code></pre>

<p>You won't run into the problem (as often) if you give your variables more descriptive names (3 different uses of the name <code>a</code> in 10 lines of code!):</p>

<pre><code>amount = int(raw_input('Give amount: '))
</code></pre>

<p>and change <code>range(a)</code> to <code>range(amount)</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Your <code>a</code> is a global name so-to-say.</p>

<pre><code>a = int(raw_input('Give amount: '))
</code></pre>

<p>Whenever Python sees an <code>a</code>, it thinks you are talking about the above one. Calling it something else (elsewhere or here) should help.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>python is a dynamically typed language. the type of a variable is determined at run time and it can vary as the execution is in progress.
Here at first, you have declared a to hold an integer type and later you have assigned a function to it and so its type now became a function.</p>

<p>you are trying to apply '<strong>a</strong>' as argument to <strong>range()</strong> function which expects and int arg but you have in effect provided a function variable as argument.</p>

<p>the corrected code shoud be</p>

<pre><code> a = int(raw_input('Give amount: '))

def fib():
    a, b = 0, 1
    while 1:
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

b = fib()
b.next()

for i in range(a):
    print b.next(),
</code></pre>

<p>this will work</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I would use this method:</p>

<pre><code>a = int(raw_input('Give amount: '))

def fib(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in xrange(n):
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

print list(fib(a))
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Also you can try the closed form solution (no guarantees for very large values of n due to rounding/overflow errors):</p>

<pre>
root5 = pow(5, 0.5)
ratio = (1 + root5)/2

def fib(n):
    return int((pow(ratio, n) - pow(1 - ratio, n))/root5)
</pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Since you are writing a generator, why not use two yields, to save doing the extra shuffle?</p>

<pre><code>import itertools as it

num_iterations = int(raw_input('How many? '))
def fib():
    a,b = 1,0
    while True:
        yield a
        b = a+b
        yield b
        a = a+b

for x in it.islice(fib(), num_iterations):
    print x
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I've build this a while ago:</p>

<pre><code>a = int(raw_input('Give amount: '))

fab = [0, 1, 1]
def fab_gen():
    while True:
        fab.append(fab[-1] + fab[-2])
        yield fab[-4]

fg = fab_gen()
for i in range(a): print(fg.next())
</code></pre>

<p>No that <code>fab</code> will grow over time, so it isn't a perfect solution.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Also you can use enumerate infinite generator:</p>

<pre><code>for i,f  in enumerate(fib()):
    print i, f
    if i&gt;=n: break
</code></pre>
