<h3>Question (ID-6439140):</h3><h2>int((0.1+0.7)*10) = 7 in several languages. How to prevent this?</h2><p>Recently I came across a bug/feature in several languages. I have a very basic knowledge about how it's caused (and I'd like some detailed explanation), but when I think of all the bugs I must have made over the years, the question is how can I determine "<strong><em>Hey, this might cause a riddiculous bug, I'd better use arbitrary precision functions</em></strong>", what other languages do have this bug (and those who don't, <strong>why</strong>). Also, why 0.1+0.7 does this and i.e. 0.1+0.3 doesn't, are there any other well-known examples?</p>

<p>PHP </p>

<pre><code>//the first one actually doesn't make any sense to me,
//why 7 after typecast if it's represented internally as 8?
debug_zval_dump((0.1+0.7)*10); //double(8) refcount(1)
debug_zval_dump((int)((0.1+0.7)*10)); //long(7) refcount(1)
debug_zval_dump((float)((0.1+0.7)*10)); //double(8) refcount(1)
</code></pre>

<p>Python:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; ((0.1+0.7)*10)
7.9999999999999991
&gt;&gt;&gt; int((0.1+0.7)*10)
7
</code></pre>

<p>Javascript:</p>

<pre><code>alert((0.1+0.7)*10); //7.999999999999999
alert(parseInt((0.7+0.1)*10)); //7
</code></pre>

<p>Ruby:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; ((0.1+0.7)*10).to_i                                                  
=&gt; 7                                                                    
&gt;&gt;((0.1+0.7)*10)                                                       
=&gt; 7.999999999999999

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>It's not a language issue. It's general issue with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point" rel="nofollow">float point arithmetic</a>. </p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point#Accuracy_problems" rel="nofollow">Stop using floats</a>. No, really.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point#Accuracy_problems" rel="nofollow">floating point representation of numbers is not exact</a>.</p>

<p>In Python, <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#int" rel="nofollow">int</a> truncates floats <strong>towards zero</strong> to the nearest integer. 
<code>(int)</code> in PHP, <code>parseInt</code> in Javascript, and <code>to_i</code> in Ruby do the same thing.</p>

<p>This is not a bug; it's just how these functions work.</p>

<p>For example, from <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#int" rel="nofollow">the docs</a> for Python's <code>int</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Conversion of floating point numbers
  to integers truncates (towards zero).</p>
</blockquote>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>This is a known problem that has to do with floating point representation, from which you can find more information here:</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754-2008" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754-2008</a></p>

<p>The specific problem is that 7.9 will be directly converted (trunc) to 7 while transforming it to an int. In Python you can solve this with:</p>

<pre><code>int( round(((0.1+0.7)*10)) )
</code></pre>

<p>... and similarly in other languages.</p>

<p>But yes, this can be a problem in many situations. Floating point numbers are not reliable enough for payroll programs, for example.</p>

<p>Maybe others can give you other hints. Hpe this helps, anywway.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Use the <code>decimal</code> module:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; int((decimal.Decimal('0.1')+decimal.Decimal('0.7'))*10)
8
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>PHP uses floating point numbers by default, you need to manually cast to integers.</p>

<p>You should be aware of floating point arithmetic. The other posts here provide enough links about that.</p>

<p>Personally I use round/ ceil/ float depending on what I expect as opposed to int</p>

<pre><code>$a = (int) round((0.7 + 0.1) * 10);
</code></pre>
