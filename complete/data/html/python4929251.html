<h3>Question (ID-4929251):</h3><h2>Can you step through python code to help debug issues?</h2><p>In java/c# you can easily step through code to trace what might be going wrong, and IDE's make this process very user friendly.</p>

<p>Can you trace through python code in a similiar fashion?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Yes! There's a Python debugger called <code>pdb</code> just for doing that!</p>

<p>You can launch a Python program through <code>pdb</code> by using <code>pdb myscript.py</code> or <code>python -m pdb myscript.py</code>.</p>

<p>There are a few commands you can then issue, which are documented on the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/pdb.html" rel="nofollow"><code>pdb</code></a> page.</p>

<p>Some useful ones to remember are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>b</code>: set a breakpoint</li>
<li><code>c</code>: continue debugging until you hit a breakpoint</li>
<li><code>s</code>: step through the code</li>
<li><code>l</code>: list all the variables in the current scope</li>
<li><code>u</code>: navigate up a stack frame</li>
<li><code>d</code>: navigate down a stack frame</li>
</ul>

<p>If you don't want to use a command line debugger, some IDEs like <a href="http://pydev.org/" rel="nofollow">Pydev</a> have a GUI debugger.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><a href="http://docs.python.org/library/pdb.html" rel="nofollow"><code>pdb</code></a></p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>There is a module called 'pdb' in python. At the top of your python script you do</p>

<pre><code>import pdb
pdb.set_trace()
</code></pre>

<p>and you will enter into debugging mode. You can use 's' to step, 'n' to follow next line similar to what you would do with 'gdb' debugger.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You can look at <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/pdb.html" rel="nofollow">python debugger</a> which does exactly what you're looking for only not through a GUI</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>If you want an IDE with integrated debugger, try <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pyscripter/" rel="nofollow">PyScripter</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>If you come from Java/C# background I guess your best bet would be to use <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/" rel="nofollow">Eclipse</a> with <a href="http://pydev.org/" rel="nofollow">Pydev</a>. This gives you a fully functional IDE with debugger built in. I use it with django as well.</p>
