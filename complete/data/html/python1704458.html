<h3>Question (ID-1704458):</h3><h2>Get uncompressed size of a .gz file in python</h2><p>Using gzip, tell() returns the offset in the uncompressed file.<br>
In order to show a progress bar, I want to know the original (uncompressed) size of the file.<br>
Is there an easy way to find out?  </p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The <a href="http://www.gzip.org/zlib/rfc-gzip.html#header-trailer" rel="nofollow">gzip format</a> specifies a field called <code>ISIZE</code> that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This contains the size of the original (uncompressed) input data modulo 2^32.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In <a href="http://pydoc.org/get.cgi/usr/local/lib/python2.5/gzip.py" rel="nofollow">gzip.py</a>, which I assume is what you're using for gzip support, there is a method called <code>_read_eof</code> defined as such:</p>

<pre><code>def _read_eof(self):
    # We've read to the end of the file, so we have to rewind in order
    # to reread the 8 bytes containing the CRC and the file size.
    # We check the that the computed CRC and size of the
    # uncompressed data matches the stored values.  Note that the size
    # stored is the true file size mod 2**32.
    self.fileobj.seek(-8, 1)
    crc32 = read32(self.fileobj)
    isize = U32(read32(self.fileobj))   # may exceed 2GB
    if U32(crc32) != U32(self.crc):
        raise IOError, "CRC check failed"
    elif isize != LOWU32(self.size):
        raise IOError, "Incorrect length of data produced"
</code></pre>

<p>There you can see that the <code>ISIZE</code> field is being read, but only to to compare it to <code>self.size</code> for error detection. This then should mean that <code>GzipFile.size</code> stores the actual uncompressed size. However, I <em>think</em> it's not exposed publicly, so you might have to hack it in to expose it. Not so sure, sorry.</p>

<p>I just looked all of this up right now, and I haven't tried it so I could be wrong. I hope this is of some use to you. Sorry if I misunderstood your question.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The last 4 bytes of the .gz hold the original size of the file</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Unix way: use "gunzip -l file.gz" via subprocess.call / os.popen, capture and parse its output.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Looking at the source for the <code>gzip</code> module, I see that the underlying file object for <code>GzipFile</code> seems to be <code>fileobj</code>.  So:</p>

<pre><code>mygzipfile = gzip.GzipFile()
...
mygzipfile.fileobj.tell()
</code></pre>

<p>?  </p>

<p>Maybe it would be good to do some sanity checking before doing that, like checking that the attribute exists with <code>hasattr</code>.</p>

<p>Not exactly a public API, but...</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>GzipFile.size stores the uncompressed size, but it's only incremented when you read the file, so you should prefer len(fd.read()) instead of the non-public GzipFile.size.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><pre><code>    f = gzip.open(filename)
    # kludge - report uncompressed file position so progess bars
    # don't go to 400%
    f.tell = f.fileobj.tell
</code></pre>
