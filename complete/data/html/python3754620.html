<h3>Question (ID-3754620):</h3><h2>a basic question about "while true"</h2><p>level: beginner</p>

<pre><code>def play_game(word_list):
    hand = deal_hand(HAND_SIZE) # random init
    while True:
        cmd = raw_input('Enter n to deal a new hand, r to replay the last hand, or e to end game: ')
        if cmd == 'n':
            hand = deal_hand(HAND_SIZE)
            play_hand(hand.copy(), word_list)
            print
        elif cmd == 'r':
            play_hand(hand.copy(), word_list)
            print
        elif cmd == 'e':
            break
        else:
            print "Invalid command."
</code></pre>

<p>my question: while WHAT is True?</p>

<p>i reckon saying 'while true' is shorthand but for what? while the variable 'hand' is being assigned a value? and what if the variable 'hand' is not being assigned a value?</p>

The <code>while</code> statement takes an expression and executes the loop body while the expression evaluates to (boolean) "true". <code>True</code> always evaluates to boolean "true" and thus executes the loop body indefinitely. It's an idiom that you'll just get used to eventually! Most languages you're likely to encounter have equivalent idioms.</p>

<p>Note that most languages usually have some mechanism for breaking out of the loop early. In the case of Python it's the <code>break</code> statement in the <code>cmd == 'e'</code> case of the sample in your question.</p>

<p>While <code>True</code> is <code>True</code>.</p>

<p>The while loop will run as long as the conditional expression evaluates to <code>True</code>.</p>

<p>Since <code>True</code> always evaluates to <code>True</code>, the loop will run indefinitely, until something within the loop <code>return</code>s or <code>break</code>s.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>while <code>True</code> is true -- ie always.  This is an infinite loop</p>

<p>Note the important distinction here between <code>True</code> which is a keyword in the language denoting a constant value of a particular type, and 'true' which is a mathematical concept.</p>

<p>Everything inside the () of the while statement is going to be evaluated as a boolean. Meaning it gets converted into either true or false.</p>

<p>Consider in the statement <code>while(6 &gt; 5)</code> </p>

<p>It first evaluates the expression <code>6 &gt; 5</code> which is <code>true</code> so is the same as saying <code>while(true)</code></p>

<p>Anything that is not FALSE, 0, an emptry string "", null, or undefined is likely to be evaluated to true.</p>

<p>When I first started programming I used to do things like <code>if(foo == true)</code>, I didn't realise that was virtually the same thing as <code>if(foo)</code>. </p>

<p>So when you say <code>while(true)</code> its like are saying <code>while(true == true)</code></p>

<p>So to answer you question: While TRUE is True.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>In this context, I suppose it could be interpreted as </p>

<pre><code>do
...
while cmd  != 'e' 
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>A <code>while</code> loop takes a conditional argument (meaning something that is generally either true or false, or can be interpreted as such), and only executes while the condition yields <code>True</code>.</p>

<p>As for <code>while True</code>? Well, the simplest true conditional is <code>True</code> itself! So this is an infinite loop, usually good in a game that requires lots of looping. (More common from my perspective, though, is to set some sort of "done" variable to false and then making that true to end the game, and the loop would look more like <code>while not done:</code> or whatever.)</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p><code>while</code> loops continue to loop until the condition is false. For instance (pseudocode):</p>

<pre><code>i = 0
while i &lt; 10
  i++
</code></pre>

<p>With each iteration of the loop, <code>i</code> will be incremented by 1, until it is 10. At that point, the condition <code>i &lt; 10</code> is no longer true, and the loop will complete.</p>

<p>Since the condition in <code>while True</code> is explicitly and always <code>true</code>, the loop will never end (until it is broken out of some other way, usually by a construct like <code>break</code> within the loop body).</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>In some languages True is just and alias for the number.  You can learn more why this is by reading more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_logic" rel="nofollow">boolean logic</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>Formally, <code>True</code> is a Python <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/constants.html" rel="nofollow">built-in constant</a> of <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#bool" rel="nofollow">bool</a> type. </p>

<p>You can use <a href="http://docs.python.org/release/2.5.2/lib/boolean.html" rel="nofollow">Boolean operations</a> on bool types (at the interactive python prompt for example) and <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html?highlight=bool#bool" rel="nofollow">convert numbers</a> into bool types:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print not True
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; print not False
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; print True or False
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; print True and False
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; a=bool(9)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print a
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; b=bool(0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print b
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; b=bool(0.000000000000000000000000000000000001)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print b
True
</code></pre>

<p>And there are "gotcha's" potentially with what you see and what the Python compiler sees:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; n=0
&gt;&gt;&gt; print bool(n)
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; n='0'
&gt;&gt;&gt; print bool(n)
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; n=0.0
&gt;&gt;&gt; print bool(n)
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; n="0.0"
&gt;&gt;&gt; print bool(n)
True
</code></pre>

<p>As a hint of how Python stores bool types internally, you can cast bool types to integers and True will come out to be 1 and False 0:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print True+0
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; print True+1
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; print False+0
0
&gt;&gt;&gt; print False+1
1
</code></pre>

<p>But <strong>you should not rely on that</strong>! It is just interesting. In many C programs, which lacks a bool type, there are commonly these definitions in standard header files to define TRUE and FALSE to be used logically in the C program:</p>

<pre><code>#ifndef FALSE
#define FALSE (0)
#define TRUE (!(FALSE))
#endif
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>#ifndef (TRUE)
#define TRUE (1)
#endif
</code></pre>

<p>This is where the <code>True==1</code> assumption came from I suppose. Python does have a bool type and it would be poor practice to assume any value for <code>True</code> other than <code>True</code>.  </p>

<p>The more important part of your question is "What is <code>while True</code>?" And an important corollary: What is false? </p>

<p>First, for every language you are learning, learn what the language considers TRUE and FALSE. Python considers <a href="http://docs.python.org/release/2.5.2/lib/truth.html" rel="nofollow">Truth</a> slightly differently than <a href="http://www.foo.be/docs/tpj/issues/vol4_2/tpj0402-0002.html" rel="nofollow">Perl Truth</a> for example. Other languages have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type" rel="nofollow">slightly different concepts</a> of true / false. <strong>Know what your language considers to be True and False for different operations and flow control to avoid many headaches later!</strong></p>

<p>There are many algorithms where you want to process something until you find what you are looking for. Hence the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_loop" rel="nofollow">infinite loop</a> or indefinite loop. Each language tend to have its own idiom for these constructs. Here are common C infinite loops, which also work for Perl:</p>

<pre><code>for(;;) { /* loop until break */ }
while (1) {
   return if (function(arg) &gt; 3);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>while True:</code> form is common in Python for indefinite loops with some way of breaking out of the loop. Learn Python <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/controlflow.html#break-and-continue-statements-and-else-clauses-on-loops" rel="nofollow">flow control</a> to understand how you break out of <code>while True</code> loops. Unlike most languages, for example, Python can have an <code>else</code> clause on a loop. There is an example in the last link.</p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p><code>True</code> is always <code>True</code>, so <code>while True</code> will loop forever.</p>

<p>The <code>while</code> keyword takes an expression, and loops while the expression is true. <code>True</code> is an expression that is always true.</p>

<p>As a possibly clarifying example, consider the following:</p>

<pre><code>a = 1
result = a == 1
</code></pre>

<p>Here, <code>a == 1</code> will return <code>True</code>, and hence put <code>True</code> into <code>result</code>. Hence, </p>

<pre><code>a = 1
while a == 1:
  ...
</code></pre>

<p>is equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>while True:
  ...
</code></pre>

<p>provided you don't alter the value of <code>a</code> inside the <code>while</code> loop.</p>
<br /><b>#10</b><br /><p>Nothing evaluates to <code>True</code> faster than <code>True</code>. So, it is good if you use <code>while True</code> instead of <code>while 1==1</code> etc.</p>
<br /><b>#11</b><br /><pre><code>while True:
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>means infinite loop.</p>

<p>The while statement is often used of a finite loop. But using the constant 'True' guarantees the repetition of the while statement without the need to control the loop (setting a boolean value inside the iteration for example), unless you want to break it.</p>

<p>In fact</p>

<pre><code>True == (1 == 1)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#12</b><br /><p>while True mean infinite loop, this usually use by long process.
you can change </p>

<pre><code>while True:
</code></pre>

<p>with</p>

<pre><code>while 1:
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#13</b><br /><p>To answer your question directly: while the loop condition is True.  Which it always is, in this particular bit of code.</p>
