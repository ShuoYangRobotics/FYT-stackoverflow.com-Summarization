<h3>Question (ID-8912327):</h3><h2>How to make a gui in python</h2><p>I was wondering if any of you know where I could find a simple tutorial on the web maybe to make a very simplistic gui. I have no idea how to start out in code to make one so I need your help. What I want the gui to be used for is I have written a program that I want to be to use it on other computers that already don't have python on it. I have already made an executable but I would much rather use a gui just because of the more "polished" look it has.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-10):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Consider <a href="http://wxpython.org/what.php">wxPython</a> (which is cross-platform). Here is <a href="http://wiki.wxpython.org/Getting%20Started">a tutorial</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Using <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/products/" rel="nofollow">Qt</a> in Python is a really pleasant experience: <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt</a></p>

<p>For the quick tutorial: <a href="http://zetcode.com/tutorials/pyqt4/" rel="nofollow">http://zetcode.com/tutorials/pyqt4/</a></p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Just look at the python GUI programming options at <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming</a>.
But, Consider Wxpython for your GUI application as it is cross platform. And,from above link you could also get some IDE to work upon.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>If you're looking to build a GUI interface to trace an IP address, I would recommend VB. </p>

<p>But if you insist on sticking with Python, <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter" rel="nofollow">TkInter</a> and <a href="http://wxpython.org/" rel="nofollow">wxPython</a> are the best choices. </p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>For a start I would recommend <a href="http://wxglade.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">wxglade</a>. It is a rather easy to use tool that helps you build wxPython applications. wx is already cross platform and can be packaged with tools like <a href="http://www.py2exe.org/" rel="nofollow">py2exe</a> or <a href="http://svn.pythonmac.org/py2app/py2app/trunk/doc/index.html" rel="nofollow">py2app</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Tkinter is the "standard" GUI for Python, meaning it should be available with every Python installation.</p>

<p>In terms of learning it, and particularly learning how to use recent versions of Tkinter (which have improved a lot), I very highly recommend the TkDocs tutorial that I put together a while back - see <a href="http://www.tkdocs.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.tkdocs.com</a></p>

<p>Loaded with examples, covers basic concepts and all of the core widgets.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Docs on the python interface to tcl/tk:  <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/tkinter.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/library/tkinter.html</a></p>

<p>And an intro to using same: <a href="http://www.pythonware.com/library/tkinter/introduction/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pythonware.com/library/tkinter/introduction/</a></p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>While some suggestions have included tkinter and wxPython, the other part of the answer to your question is that you will also need to package it using something like py2app, pyinstaller, or py2exe (depending on the operating system). You mentioned the other machines do not have python, so this would be required in order to distribute the entire python environment with your app.</p>

<p>Also have a look at PySide or PyQt. They have a ton of tutorials everywhere and heavy documentation from Qt.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.ferg.org/easygui/tutorial.html" rel="nofollow">easygui</a> is a wrapper around <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter" rel="nofollow">Tkinter</a> to make things easier</p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>If you're more into gaming you can use PyGame for GUIs.  </p>
