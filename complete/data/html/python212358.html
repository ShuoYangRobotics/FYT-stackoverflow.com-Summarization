<h3>Question (ID-212358):</h3><h2>Binary Search in Python</h2><p>Is there a library function that performs binary search on a list/tuple and return the position of the item if found and 'False' (-1, None, etc.) if not?</p>

<p>I found the functions bisect_left/right in the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/bisect.html" rel="nofollow">bisect module</a>, but they still return a position even if the item is not in the list. That's perfectly fine for their intended usage, but I just want to know if an item is in the list or not (don't want to insert anything).</p>

<p>I thought of using bisect_left and then checking if the item at that position is equal to what I'm searching, but that seems cumbersome (and I also need to do bounds checking if the number can be larger than the largest number in my list). If there is a nicer method I'd like to know about it.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> To clarify what I need this for: I'm aware that a dictionary would be very well suited for this, but I'm trying to keep the memory consumption as low as possible. My intended usage would be a sort of double-way look-up table. I have in the table a list of values and I need to be able to access the values based on their index. And also I want to be able to find the index of a particular value or None if the value is not in the list.</p>

<p>Using a dictionary for this would be the fastest way, but would (approximately) double the memory requirements.</p>

<p>I was asking this question thinking that I may have overlooked something in the Python libraries. It seems I'll have to write my own code, as Moe suggested.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Why not look at the code for bisect_left/right and adapt it to suit your purpose.</p>

<p>like this:</p>

<pre><code>def binary_search(a, x, lo=0, hi=None):
    if hi is None:
        hi = len(a)
    while lo &lt; hi:
        mid = (lo+hi)//2
        midval = a[mid]
        if midval &lt; x:
            lo = mid+1
        elif midval &gt; x: 
            hi = mid
        else:
            return mid
    return -1
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>This is a little off-topic (since Moe's answer seems complete to the OP's question), but it might be worth looking at the complexity for your whole procedure from end to end.  If you're storing thing in a sorted lists (which is where a binary search would help), and then just checking for existence, you're incurring (worst-case, unless specified):</p>

<p><strong>Sorted Lists</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>O( n log n) to initially create the list (if it's unsorted data, or O(n) )</li>
<li>O( log n) lookup</li>
<li>O( n ) insert / delete  (might be O(1) or O(log n) average case, depending on your pattern)</li>
</ul>

<p>Whereas with a <strong>set</strong>, you're incurring</p>

<ul>
<li>O(n) to create</li>
<li>O(1) lookup</li>
<li>O(1) insert / delete</li>
</ul>

<p>The thing a sorted list really gets you are "next", "previous", and "ranges" (including inserting or deleting ranges), which are O(1) or O(|range|), given a starting index.  If you aren't using those sorts of operations often, then storing as sets, and sorting for display might be a better deal overall.  set() incurs very little additional overhead in python.  </p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Simplest is to use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/bisect.html" rel="nofollow">bisect</a> and check one position back to see if the item is there:</p>

<pre><code>def binary_search(a,x,lo=0,hi=-1):
    i = bisect(a,x,lo,hi)
    if i == 0:
        return -1
    elif a[i-1] == x:
        return i-1
    else:
        return -1
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><pre><code>from bisect import bisect_left

def binary_search(a, x, lo=0, hi=None):   # can't use a to specify default for hi
    hi = hi if hi is not None else len(a) # hi defaults to len(a)   
    pos = bisect_left(a,x,lo,hi)          # find insertion position
    return (pos if pos != hi and a[pos] == x else -1) # don't walk off the end
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>If you just want to see if it's present, try turning the list into a dict:</p>

<pre><code># Generate a list
l = [n*n for n in range(1000)]

# Convert to dict - doesn't matter what you map values to
d = dict((x, 1) for x in l)

count = 0
for n in range(1000000):
    # Compare with "if n in l"
    if n in d:
        count += 1
</code></pre>

<p>On my machine, "if n in l" took 37 seconds, while "if n in d" took 0.4 seconds.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Using a dict wouldn't like double your memory usage unless the objects you're storing are really tiny, since the values are only pointers to the actual objects:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 'foo'
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = [a]
&gt;&gt;&gt; c = [a]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b[0] is c[0]
True
</code></pre>

<p>In that example, 'foo' is only stored once.  Does that make a difference for you?  And exactly how many items are we talking about anyway?</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>It might be worth mentioning that the bisect docs now provide searching examples:
<a href="http://docs.python.org/library/bisect.html#searching-sorted-lists" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/library/bisect.html#searching-sorted-lists</a></p>

<p>(Raising ValueError instead of returning -1 or None is more pythonic â€“ list.index() does it, for example. But of course you can adapt the examples to your needs.)</p>
