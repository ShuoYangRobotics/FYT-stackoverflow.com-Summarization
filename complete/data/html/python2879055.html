<h3>Question (ID-2879055):</h3><h2>Help thinking "Pythony"</h2><p>I'm brand new to Python and trying to learn it by replicating the following C++ function into python</p>

<pre><code>// determines which words in a vector consist of the same letters
// outputs the words with the same letters on the same line
void equivalentWords(vector &lt;string&gt; words, ofstream &amp; outFile) {
    outFile &lt;&lt; "Equivalent words\n";

    // checkedWord is parallel to the words vector. It is
    // used to make sure each word is only displayed once.
    vector &lt;bool&gt; checkedWord (words.size(), false);

    for(int i = 0; i &lt; words.size(); i++) {
        if (!checkedWord[i]){
            outFile &lt;&lt; "  ";
            for(int j = i; j &lt; words.size(); j++){
                if(equivalentWords(words[i], words[j], outFile)) {
                    outFile &lt;&lt; words[j] &lt;&lt; " ";
                    checkedWord[j] = true;
                }
            }
            outFile &lt;&lt; "\n";    
        }   
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In my python code (below), rather than having a second vector, I have a list ("words") of lists of a string, a sorted list of the chars in the former string (because strings are immutable), and a bool (that tells if the word has been checked yet). However, I can't figure out how to change a value as you iterate through a list.</p>

<pre><code>    for word, s_word, checked in words:
    if not checked:
        for word1, s_word1, checked1 in words:
            if s_word1 == s_word:
                checked1 = True # this doesn't work
                print word1,
        print ""
</code></pre>

<p>Any help on doing this or thinking more "Pythony" is appreciated.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Keeping things simple, this is O(N) complexity and should be sufficient if you don't have GBs of word data. Note that <code>set()</code> and <code>dict()</code> basically is a hashed index (free and builtin!).</p>

<pre><code>index = {}
for word, s_word in words:
    index[s_word] = index.get(s_word, []) + [word]

for similar_words in index.values():
    print ' '.join(similar_words)

<p>Don't know what you are using it for, but it might be of interest to you that in python 2.7 a <strong><a href="http://docs.python.org/dev/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow">Counter</a></strong> class was introduced in the collections module.</p>

<p>If you really want to keep your algorithm and update a boolean list (which you don't because that algorithm would do inefficient double loops), you would do it like this:</p>

<pre><code>checked = [False] * len(words)
for i, (word, word_s) in enumerate(words):
    if checked[i]:
       continue
    for j, (other, other_s) in enumerate(words[i:]):
        if word_s == other_s:
            print other,
            checked[i+j] = True
    print

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I generally like catchmeifyoutry's answer, but I would personally tighten it up a bit further as</p>

<pre><code>for word in set(words):
    print word
</code></pre>

<p><em><strong>Edit</strong>:  My answer is a shorter but functionally equivalent form of catchmeifyoutry's original, pre-edited answer.</em></p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I think the word you're looking for is Pythonic, here's a pythonic code sample for what you're tying to do, determine words that are equivalent, where equivalence is determined by having the same set of letters </p>

<pre><code>import collections

def print_equivalent_words(words):
    eq_words = defaultdict(list)
    for word in words:
        eq_words["".join(sorted(set(word)))].append(word)

    for k,v in eq_words.items():
        print(v)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>This is not the best algorithm to solve this problem (it's O(N^2) instead of O(N)), but here's a pythonic version of it. The method I've used is to replace your array of bits with a set that contains words you've already seen.</p>

<pre><code>checked = set()
for i, word in enumerate(words):
    if word in checked:
        continue
    to_output = [word]
    for word2 in words[i + 1:]:
        if equivalentWords(word, word2):
            to_output.append(word2)
            checked.add(word2)
    print ' '.join(to_output)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Make <code>words</code> a list of objects:</p>

<pre><code>class Word(object):
  def __init__(self, word, s_word, checked=False):
    self.word = word
    self.s_word = s_word
    self.checked = checked

 ....
    for word1 in words:
      if word1.s_word == word.s_word:
        word1.checked = True
        print word1.word
    print
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>First lesson, it's "Pythonic" or "Pythonically"  :-)</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Based on the comment:</p>

<pre><code>// determines which words in a vector consist of the same letters
// outputs the words with the same letters on the same line
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not quite sure that the original code works, and even if it does, I can't say I like it much. First of all, based on the loop nesting, it looks like the complexity is O(N<sup>2</sup>). Second, I can't figure out what it's doing well enough to be sure it really does what's stated above (it uses a three-parameter overload of <code>equivalentWords</code>, which seems to be missing, which makes it hard to say though).</p>

<p>Some of the Python solutions are a lot shorter and simpler -- to the point that I feel reasonably certain they simply don't work. A couple seem to simply print out unique words, which (at least as I interpret it) is <em>not</em> the intent at all.</p>

<p>Here's a version in C++ that does what I interpret the requirements to be:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;set&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;algorithm&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;map&gt;

std::string 
sort_word(std::string word) { 
    std::sort(word.begin(), word.end());
    return word;
}

namespace std { 
    std::ostream &amp;
    operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream &amp;os, 
               std::pair&lt;std::string, std::set&lt;std::string&gt; &gt;const &amp;words) 
    { 
        std::copy(words.second.begin(), words.second.end(), 
            std::ostream_iterator&lt;std::string&gt;(os, "\t"));
        return os;
    }
}

void 
equivalentWords(std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; const &amp;words, std::ostream &amp;os) { 
    typedef std::map&lt;std::string, std::set&lt;std::string&gt; &gt; word_list_t;
    word_list_t word_list;

    for (int i=0; i&lt;words.size(); i++)
        word_list[sort_word(words[i])].insert(words[i]);

    std::copy(word_list.begin(), word_list.end(),
              std::ostream_iterator&lt;word_list_t::value_type&gt;(os, "\n"));
}

int 
main() { 
    std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; input;

    std::copy(std::istream_iterator&lt;std::string&gt;(std::cin),
        std::istream_iterator&lt;std::string&gt;(),
        std::back_inserter(input));
    equivalentWords(input, std::cout);
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I <em>think</em> using that as a starting point for a Python version is more likely to produce a clean, working result.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>I wouldn't say this is pythonic, but I'm quite proud of it.</p>

<pre><code>import itertools

for _, to_output in itertools.groupby(sorted(words, key=sorted), sorted):
    print ' '.join(to_output)
</code></pre>
