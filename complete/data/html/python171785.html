<h3>Question (ID-171785):</h3><h2>How do you organize Python modules?</h2><p>When it comes to organizing python modules, my Mac OS X system is a mess. I've packages lying around everywhere on my hdd and no particular system to organize them.</p>

<p>How do you keep everything manageable?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>My advice:</p>

<ul>
<li>Read <a href="http://docs.python.org/install/index.html" rel="nofollow">Installing Python Modules</a>.</li>
<li>Read <a href="http://docs.python.org/distutils/index.html" rel="nofollow">Distributing Python Modules</a>.</li>
<li>Start using easy_install from <a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools" rel="nofollow">setuptools</a>. Read the documentation for setuptools.</li>
<li>Always use <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv" rel="nofollow">virtualenv</a>. My site-packages directory contains <strong>setuptools and virtualenv only</strong>.</li>
<li>Check out Ian Bicking's new project <a href="http://www.openplans.org/projects/topp-engineering/blog/2008/09/24/pyinstall-a-new-hope/" rel="nofollow">pyinstall</a>. </li>
<li>Follow everything <a href="http://blog.ianbicking.org" rel="nofollow">Ian Bicking</a> is working on. It is always goodness.</li>
<li>When creating your own packages, use distutils/setuptools. Consider using <code>paster create</code> (see <a href="http://pythonpaste.org" rel="nofollow">http://pythonpaste.org</a>) to create your initial directory layout.</li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>In addition to PEP8 and easy_install, you should check out virtualenv. Virtualenv allows you to have multiple different python library trees. At work, we use virtualenv with a bootstrapping environment to quickly set up a development/production environment where we are all in sync w.r.t library versions etc. We generally coordinate library upgrades.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>There are several families of Python componentry.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The stuff that comes with Python.  This takes care of itself.</p></li>
<li><p>The stuff that you got with easy_install.  This, also, takes care of itself.</p></li>
<li><p>The packages that you had to get some other way, either as TARballs or SVN checkouts. Create a <code>Components</code> folder.  Put the downloads or the SVN's in there first.  Every Single Time.  Do installs from there.</p></li>
<li><p>The packages that you wrote that are reusable.  I have a <code>Projects</code> folder with each project in that folder.  If the project is a highly reusable thing, it has a <code>setup.py</code> and I actually run the install as if I downloaded it.   I don't have many of these, but a few.  Some of them might become open source projects.</p></li>
<li><p>The final applications you write.  I have a folder in <code>Projects</code> with each of these top-level applications.  These are usually big, rambling things (like Django sites) and don't have <code>setup.py</code>.  Why?  They're often pretty complex with only a few server installations to manage, and each of those server installations is unique.  These generally rely on <code>PYTHONPATH</code> to identify their parts.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Notice the common theme.  Either they're Components you downloaded or they're Projects you're working on.</p>

<p>Also, I keep this separate (to an extent) from the client.  I have a master directory of Client folders, each of which has Projects and each project has Sales and Delivery.  Not all projects have both sales and delivery.  </p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Maybe <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow">PEP8</a> and <a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall" rel="nofollow">easy_install</a> can help you?</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I keep all the source for my packages inside ~/Packages/ , and then I do a standard install with "python2.5 setup.py install" on them.  This tosses into (for me) /Library/Frameworks/Python/Versions/current/lib/python2.5/site-packages/ .  For the development of my own software, I have aliases set up to switch between trunk/ branches/1.0, etc, by pre-prending onto PYTHONPATH.  (I have to run 'setup.py build_ext --inplace' in each of these directories before they will import properly.)</p>

<p>It's worth noting that Python2.6 has a <a href="http://docs.python.org/dev/whatsnew/2.6.html#pep-370-per-user-site-packages-directory" rel="nofollow">per-user site-packages directory</a>, which you may find more convenient.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/tut/node8.html" rel="nofollow">The "Modules" Python documentation page</a> is a useful guide on organising code, specifically the "packages" sections</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>My advice is to try to put everything into your site-packages directory(ies) unless you have a good reason not to.  And I try to avoid easy_install because I find that it tends to cruft up my sys.path with egg locations, but that's just me.  Some people find it useful.</p>

<p>If you have lots of programs that use different libraries that may conflict with each other, you may also want to check out <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv" rel="nofollow">virtualenv</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Just ran across this site from another StackOverflow question: <a href="http://infinitemonkeycorps.net/docs/pph/" rel="nofollow">http://infinitemonkeycorps.net/docs/pph/</a> This addresses more than just module placement, but once you place it write how you can easily handle documentation, testing, and distribution.</p>
