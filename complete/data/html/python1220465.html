<h3>Question (ID-1220465):</h3><h2>"Watching" program being proccessed line-by-line?</h2><p>I'm looking for a debugging tool that will run my Python app, but display which line is currently being processed -- like an automatically stepping debugger.  Basically I want to see what is going on, but be able to jump in if a traceback occurs.</p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Here's a radical thought: Don't.</p>

<p>"Watching" is a crutch.  You should be writing small sections of code that you <strong>know</strong> will work.  Then put those together.</p>

<p>Watching sometimes results from "I'm not sure what Python's really doing", so there's an urge to "watch" execution and see what's happening.  Other times watching results from writing a script that's too big and complex without proper decomposition.  Sometimes watching results from having a detailed specification which was translated into Python without a deep understanding.  I've seen people doing these; of course, there are lots more reasons.</p>

<p>The advice, however, is the same for all:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Break things into small pieces,
usually classes of functions.  Make
them simple enough that you can
actually understand what Python is
doing.  </p></li>
<li><p>Knit them together to create your
larger application from pieces you
actually understand.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Watching will limit your ability to actually write working software.  It will -- in a very real way -- limit you to trivial programming exercises.  It's not a good learning tool; and it's a perfectly awful way to create production code.</p>

<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong>.</p>

<p>Don't pursue "watching".  Decompose into smaller pieces so you don't need to watch.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The integrated debugger in <a href="http://www.wingware.com/" rel="nofollow">Wing IDE</a> is quite versatile and nice to work with. (The <a href="http://www.wingware.com/wingide-101/index" rel="nofollow">Wing IDE 101</a> version is freeware.)</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>There is also a very nice debugger in The <a href="http://pydev.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">Python Eclipse plugin.</a></p>
