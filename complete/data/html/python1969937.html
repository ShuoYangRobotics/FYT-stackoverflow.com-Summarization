<h3>Question (ID-1969937):</h3><h2>Iteration WAS working in my script, now I cant get python to iterate - what happened?</h2><p>Did my python ide break or something?</p>

<pre><code>import sys

i = 0
sample = ("this", "is", "Annoying!")

for line in sample:
    print i, line
    i + 1
</code></pre>

<p>Now gives me...</p>

<pre>
0 this 
0 is 
0 Annoying!
</pre>

<p>I THOUGHT, it would give me:</p>

<pre>
1 this 
2 is 
3 Annoying
</pre>

<p>I had other scripts that I was working on and it they all just broke - they all have the same line number when they print numerous iterations using the for statement - can someone PLEASE tell me what the heck is going on - very frustrated lol... did Python break? Do I need sleep?  What is wrong here?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>While the other answers are correct, this is how you usually do this in python:</p>

<pre><code>sample = ("this", "is", "Annoying!")

for i, line in enumerate(sample):
    print i, line
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>enumerate</code> function does exactly what you want: Iterating through your tuple, while at the same time giving you (line) numbers.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You are calculating <code>i+1</code> but are not storing the result of that anywhere. Specifically you are not updating <code>i</code> to contain the new value. Use <code>i = i + 1</code> or <code>i += 1</code> instead.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>This works just fine for me:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import sys
&gt;&gt;&gt; i = 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; sample = ("abc", "def", "ghi")
&gt;&gt;&gt; for line in sample:
...   i = i + 1
...   print i, line
... 
1 abc
2 def
3 ghi
</code></pre>

<p>Are you sure you're incrementing and storing the value <code>i</code>? (Your sample omits this, but in another answer you say you did put <code>i = i + 1</code>.) Remember, Python is whitespace-sensitive, so if you did something like this, the result won't be what you expect:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; for line in sample:
...   print i, line
... i = i + 1 # &lt;-- This is not part of the loop!
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I suspect you have an indentation problem, that perhaps the i = i + 1 statement is somehow not part of the for-loop.  </p>

<p>But Instead of doing your own counter incrementing, better practice is to use enumerate:</p>

<pre><code>for i,line in enumerate(sample):
    print i,line
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>The problem is you're doing "i + 1", not "i=i+1"</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You're not incrementing the variable <code>i</code> in your code, you'd need to do something like:</p>

<pre><code>for line in sample:
    i = i + 1
    print i, line
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>The result that you expect would be obtained by using enumerate:</p>

<pre><code>sample = ("this", "is", "Annoying!")
for index, line in enumerate(sample):
    print index, line
</code></pre>

<p>I don't see how the code that you posted ever would have worked in any version of Python.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Just step through debugger to see the execution.</p>
