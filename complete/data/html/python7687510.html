<h3>Question (ID-7687510):</h3><h2>python - 'tuple' object does not support item assignment</h2><p>I am using the PIL library.</p>

<p>I am trying to make an image look red-er, this is what i've got.</p>

<pre><code>from PIL import Image
image = Image.open('balloon.jpg')
pixels = list(image.getdata())
for pixel in pixels: 
    pixel[0] = pixel[0] + 20    
image.putdata(pixels)
image.save('new.bmp')
</code></pre>

<p>However I get this error: <code>TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
</code></p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The second line should have been <code>pixels[0]</code>, with an S. You probably have a tuple named <code>pixel</code>, and tuples are immutable. Construct new pixels instead:</p>

<pre><code>image = Image.open('balloon.jpg')

pixels = [(pix[0] + 20,) + pix[1:] for pix in image.getdata()]

image.putdate(pixels)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>PIL pixels are tuples, and tuples are immutable. You need to construct a new tuple. So, instead of the for loop, do:</p>

<pre><code>pixels = [(pixel[0] + 20, pixel[1], pixel[2]) for pixel in pixels]
image.putdata(pixels)
</code></pre>

<p>Also, if the pixel is already too red, adding 20 will overflow the value. You probably want something like <code>max(pixel[0] + 20, 255)</code> or <code>int(255 * (pixel[0] / 255.) ** 0.9)</code> instead of <code>pixel[0] + 20</code>.</p>

<p>And, to be able to handle images in lots of different formats, do <code>image = image.convert("RGB")</code> after opening the image. The <a href="http://www.pythonware.com/library/pil/handbook/image.htm#Image.convert" rel="nofollow">convert</a> method will ensure that the pixels are always (r, g, b) tuples.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You probably want the next transformation for you pixels:</p>

<pre><code>pixels = map(list, image.getdata())
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You have misspelt the second <code>pixels</code> as <code>pixel</code>. The following works:</p>

<pre><code>pixels = [1,2,3]
pixels[0] = 5
</code></pre>

<p>It appears that due to the typo you were trying to accidentally modify some tuple called <code>pixel</code>, and in Python tuples are immutable. Hence the confusing error message.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>A tuple is immutable and thus you get the error you posted.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; pixels = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; pixels[0] = 5
&gt;&gt;&gt; pixels = (1, 2, 3)
&gt;&gt;&gt; pixels[0] = 5
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
</code></pre>

<p>In your specific case, as correctly pointed out in other answers, you should write:</p>

<pre><code>pixel = (pixel[0] + 20, pixel[1], pixel[2])
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Tuples, in python can't have their values changed. If you'd like to change the contained values though I suggest using a list:</p>

<p><code>[1,2,3]</code> not <code>(1,2,3)</code></p>
