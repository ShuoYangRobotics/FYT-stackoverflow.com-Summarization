<h3>Question (ID-603115):</h3><h2>python opens text file with a space between every character</h2><p>Whenever I try to open a .csv file with the python command
<code>fread = open('input.csv', 'r')</code>
it always opens the file with spaces between every single character.  I'm guessing it's something wrong with the text file because I can open other text files with the same command and they are loaded correctly.  Does anyone know why a text file would load like this in python?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Ok, I got it with the help of Jarret Hardie's post</p>

<p>this is the code that I used to convert the file to ascii</p>

<pre><code>fread = open('input.csv', 'rb').read()
mytext = fread.decode('utf-16')
mytext = mytext.encode('ascii', 'ignore')
fwrite = open('input-ascii.csv', 'wb')
fwrite.write(mytext)
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The post by recursive is probably right... the contents of the file are likely encoded with a multi-byte charset. If this is, in fact, the case you can likely read the file in python itself without having to convert it first outside of python.</p>

<p>Try something like:</p>

<pre><code>fread = open('input.csv', 'rb').read()
mytext = fread.decode('utf-16')
</code></pre>

<p>The 'b' flag ensures the file is read as binary data. You'll need to know (or guess) the original encoding... in this example, I've used utf-16, but YMMV. This will convert the file to unicode. If you truly have a file with multi-byte chars, I don't recommend converting it to ascii as you may end up losing a lot of the characters in the process.</p>

<p>EDIT: Thanks for uploading the file. There are two bytes at the front of the file which indicates that it does, indeed, use a wide charset. If you're curious, open the file in a hex editor as some have suggested... you'll see something in the text version like 'I.D.|.' (etc). The dot is the extra byte for each char.</p>

<p>The code snippet above seems to work on my machine with that file.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Isn't csv a simple txt file with values separated with comma.
Just try to open it with a text editor to see if the file is correctly formed.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>First of all, use an hex-editor to view the file, see if there is anything irregular about it.</p>

<p>Secondly, please post the code you are using.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>It did never ocurred to me, but as truppo said, it must be something wrong with the file.</p>

<p>Try to open the file in Excel/BrOffice Calc and Save As the file as Csv again.</p>

<p>If the problem persists, try a subset of the data: fist 10/last 10/intermediate 10 lines of the file.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You might as well upload the file in question to a site like <a href="http://drop.io/" rel="nofollow">http://drop.io/</a> and give us a link.</p>

<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Open the file in binary mode, 'rb'.  Check it in a HEX Editor and check for null padding '00'.  Open the file in something like Scintilla Text Editor to check the characters present in the file.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>To read an encoded file, you can simply replace <code>open</code> with <code>codecs.open</code>.</p>

<pre><code>fread = codecs.open('input.csv', 'r', 'utf-16')
</code></pre>
