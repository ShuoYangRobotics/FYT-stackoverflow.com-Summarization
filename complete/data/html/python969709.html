<h3>Question (ID-969709):</h3><h2>Joining a set of ordered-integer yielding Python iterators</h2><p>Here is a seemingly simple problem: given a list of iterators that yield sequences of integers in ascending order, write a concise generator that yields only the integers that appear in every sequence.</p>

<p>After reading a few papers last night, I decided to hack up a completely minimal full text indexer in Python, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ghetto-fts/" rel="nofollow">as seen here</a> (though that version is quite old now).</p>

<p>My problem is with the <code>search()</code> function, which must iterate over each posting list and yield only the document IDs that appear on every list. As you can see from the link above, my current non-recursive 'working' attempt is terrible.</p>

<p><b>Example</b>:</p>

<pre><code>postings = [[1,   100, 142, 322, 12312],
            [2,   100, 101, 322, 1221],
            [100, 142, 322, 956, 1222]]
</code></pre>

<p>Should yield:</p>

<pre><code>[100, 322]
</code></pre>

<p>There is at least one elegant recursive function solution to this, but I'd like to avoid that if possible. However, a solution involving nested generator expressions, <code>itertools</code> abuse, or any other kind of code golf is more than welcome. :-)</p>

<p>It should be possible to arrange for the function to only require as many steps as there are items in the smallest list, and without sucking the entire set of integers into memory. In future, these lists may be read from disk, and larger than available RAM.</p>

<p>For the past 30 minutes I've had an idea on the tip of my tongue, but I can't quite get it into code. Remember, this is just for fun!</p>

<p>... you could try and take advantage of the fact that the lists are ordered, but since reduce, generator expressions and set are all implemented in C, you'll probably have a hard time doing better than the above with logic implemented in python.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>This solution will compute the intersection of your iterators. It works by advancing the iterators one step at a time and looking for the same value in all of them. When found, such values are yielded -- this makes the <code>intersect</code> function a generator itself.</p>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>If these are really long (or even infinite) sequences, and you don't want to load everything into a set in advance, you can implement this with a 1-item lookahead on each iterator.</p>

<pre><code>EndOfIter = object() # Sentinel value

class PeekableIterator(object):
    def __init__(self, it):
        self.it = it
        self._peek = None
        self.next() # pump iterator to get first value

    def __iter__(self): return self

    def next(self):
        cur = self._peek
        if cur is EndOfIter:
            raise StopIteration()

        try:
            self._peek = self.it.next()
        except StopIteration:
            self._peek = EndOfIter
        return cur

    def peek(self): 
        return self._peek


def contained_in_all(seqs):
   if not seqs: return   # No items
   iterators = [PeekableIterator(iter(seq)) for seq in seqs]
   first, rest = iterators[0], iterators[1:]

   for item in first:
       candidates = list(rest)
       while candidates:
           if any(c.peek() is EndOfIter for c in candidates): return  # Exhausted an iterator
           candidates = [c for c in candidates if c.peek() &lt; item]
           for c in candidates: c.next()

       # Out of loop if first item in remaining iterator are all &gt;= item.
       if all(it.peek() == item for it in rest):
           yield item

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>What about this:</p>

<pre><code>import heapq

def inalliters(iterators):
  heap=[(iterator.next(),iterator) for iterator in iterators]
  heapq.heapify(heap)
  maximal = max(heap)[0]
  while True:
    value,iterator = heapq.heappop(heap)
    if maximal==value: yield value
    nextvalue=iterator.next()
    heapq.heappush(heap,(nextvalue,iterator))
    maximal=max(maximal,nextvalue)

postings = [iter([1,   100, 142, 322, 12312]),
            iter([2,   100, 101, 322, 1221]),

<p>I haven't tested it very thoroughly (just ran your example), but I believe the basic idea is sound.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I want to show that there's an elegant solution, which <strong>only iterates forward once</strong>. Sorry, I don't know the Python well enough, so I use fictional classes. This one reads <code>input</code>, an array of iterators, and writes to <code>output</code> on-the-fly without ever going back or using any array function!.</p>

<pre><code>    def intersect (input, output) 
        do:
            min = input[0]
            bingo = True
            for i in input:
                if (i.cur &lt; min.cur):
                     bingo = False
                     min =  i
            if bingo: 
                output.push(min.cur)
        while (min.step())
