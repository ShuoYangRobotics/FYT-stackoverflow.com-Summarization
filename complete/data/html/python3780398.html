<h3>Question (ID-3780398):</h3><h2>Integrating a script language into a C++ application</h2><p>I'm really new to C++ and I've come across a problem I've not been able to solve by reading documentations.</p>

<p>I want to embed a script language into my c++ application. That language could be javascript, lua or preferably python.</p>

<p>I'm not looking for something like Boost.Python / swig, something that is able to wrap my c++ functions / classes to a python interface, but rather a <code>python_evaluate_and_return_result_as_variable("my_code");</code> function.</p>

<p>I have a whole bunch of structs containing a few integers:</p>

<pre><code>struct my_integers {
    int a;
    int b;
    int c;
    int d;
    int e;
};
</code></pre>

<p>Now I want to do some math with these integers, for example:</p>

<pre><code>i.a = i.c * i.e;
</code></pre>

<p>The math I want to do will be changing a lot in the future and I need people other then me be able to change the math without having access to the c++ code.</p>

<p>I'm thinking about a code structure like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>I initialize my struct and fill it with the starting values</li>
<li>I load an external python function, lets say "my_python_function", that takes the struct as an argument and does so math with it before returning it.</li>
<li>I get my struct like <code>i = my_python_function_cppwrapper(i)</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Is something like that possible? I googled a lot for this but the only thing I seem to find are wrappers that provide c++ -> python (or the other way around) functionallity without really interacting with variables.</p>

<p>I'd be really thankful for any help,<br />
Robin.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Why not use Boost.Python? You can expose your data classes to Python and execute a script/function as described <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_44_0/libs/python/doc/tutorial/doc/html/python/embedding.html">here</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If you want to simply run Python scripts from C/C++, then use <a href="http://docs.python.org/c-api/index.html" rel="nofollow">the Python C API</a>.  In your C/C++ code:</p>

<pre><code>PyRun_SimpleString("import math; x = math.sqrt(2 * 2)");
</code></pre>

<p>For more complicated things, you will have to look at the API docs, but it's pretty straightforward.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>How about embedding a JavaScript engine, such as <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/v8/intro.html" rel="nofollow">V8</a>?</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>dont forget the grand-daddy of embedded scripting language - tcl.</p>

<p>tcl has v nice c++ wrapper (modelled on boost.python) that makes it trivial to invoke and to wire up callbacks to your code</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Lua works pretty well too, especially since its small, is ansi c compliant, has a low memory foot print along with a great wiki and messaging list. If you need even more speed there is a x86 32 and 64 bit jit version(luajit). Binding can be done with an array of tools/libraries, like swig or lunar(the wiki lists them all). The only problem that i can see is binding the struct members so they can be referenced directly(ie: struct.member = 4), though its possible to set this up with metatables that have get and set methods bound to variable names </p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>You say that you're not looking for something to wrap your C++ functions / classes in a Python interface, but if you want Python code to be able to refer to members of your C++ <code>my_integers</code> structure, that <em>is</em> wrapping C++ classes in a Python interface.  Of course, you're free to wrap as many or as few classes as you want - in this example, you'd wrap <code>my_integers</code>, then you'd <a href="http://docs.python.org/extending/embedding.html" rel="nofollow">embed a Python interpreter</a> to do stuff with <code>my_integers</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>For something as simple as you describe, you could implement an interpreter for your own 'little language'. You could even call it the "Robin" language. ;-)</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>I advice using <strong><a href="http://www.lua.org/" rel="nofollow">Lua</a></strong> as internal scripting engine. Implementation is just a few lines, and though light, the language has sufficient power. So no need for TCL. You might as well look at python, integration in C++ is rather easy, as there exists a <strong><a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_44_0/libs/python/doc/index.html" rel="nofollow">Boost.Python</a></strong> implementation facilitating integration.</p>

<p>But depending on the application, I'd still recommend Lua.</p>
