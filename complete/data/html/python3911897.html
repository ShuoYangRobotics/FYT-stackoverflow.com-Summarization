<h3>Question (ID-3911897):</h3><h2>"Pythonic" multithreaded (Concurrent) language</h2><p>I now primarily write in python, however I am looking for a language that is more thread friendly (not JAVA,C#,C or C++).</p>

<p>Python's threads are good when they are IO bound but it's coming up short when I am doing something CPU intensive.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Thanks,
James</p>

Apparently it's as fast as Java for a lot of things, despite being dynamically typed *.  Java interop is about as convenient as I could imagine possible, though the native clojure libraries are already decent enough that you don't need to hit up Java for most things.</p>

<p>It also adds some "scripting language" sensibilities, like maps (-> Python dicts) and vectors (-> Python lists) to help reduce the likelihood of parenthetical paroxysm.</p>

<p>Oh right, concurrency.  It uses a software transactional memory system which is pretty interesting in and of itself.  <a href="http://clojure.org/concurrent_programming" rel="nofollow">Extra, extra: Read all about it</a>.</p>

<p>*: I think you may need to use "type hinting" to get Java-like speed for a lot of tasks.  This is made quite convenient in Clojure.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Before anything else, what programming problem are you trying to solve? Has the GIL actually become a bottleneck yet? (If you're not sure, it probably hasn't.)</p>

<p>Without knowing this, you risk looking for a nail that fits your hammer, instead of the other way around.</p>

<p>If you really, really know that the GIL has become a bottleneck, and that you need to crunch numbers across multiple processors, then you want to consider:</p>

<ol>
<li>If you have known CPU-critical sections, compile them with C type declarations using <a href="http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/greg.ewing/python/Pyrex/" rel="nofollow">Pyrex</a>/<a href="http://www.cython.org/" rel="nofollow">Cython</a>, if you can. This will firstly make them much more CPU-efficient than Python bytecode interpretation, and as a bonus, allow you to release the GIL around sections that don't need it. (Moral: turn your donkeys into racehorses before trying to parallelize them.)</li>
<li>It should go without saying, but if you're using any CPU-intensive extension modules, make sure they're not already releasing the GIL for you.</li>
<li>For almost everything else, use the built-in <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html" rel="nofollow"><code>multiprocessing</code></a> module. This gives you roughly the same API and advantages as <code>threading</code>, but provides you with true <em>process-level concurrency</em>: among other things, this allows you to easily run your CPU-intensive code on multiple machines in concert, which is critical if your problem actually gets big.</li>
</ol>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><a href="http://boo.codehaus.org/" rel="nofollow">boo</a>'s syntax is Python-inspired. The programming language is a bit different, though: It's strongly typed with type-inference, and it's most imporant feature is probably the open compiler pipeline, i.e. the ability to create syntactic macros (in the LISP sense of the word "macro", not in the C sense of "preprocessor macro").</p>

<p>And, obviously, <a href="http://ironpython.net/" rel="nofollow">IronPyton</a> is quite pythonic and about as good at threading as other .NET languages.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>to overcome GIL, you can try interpreting python language with jython instead of cpython</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Python falls short when it comes to CPU intensive tasks because Python isn't a very efficient language. Many "dynamic" languages have that problem, since the compiler is limited in what it can assume about the program at compile-time. Method-calls, for example, may have to be looked up every single time in case someone has replaced the method on the object between each invokation.</p>

<p>I would recommend that you take a look at <a href="http://www.erlang.org/" rel="nofollow">Erlang</a>, even though it probably isn't "Pythonic" in your sense of the word. :-)</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.stackless.com/" rel="nofollow">Stackless Python</a> as used by the <a href="http://www.eveonline.com/devblog.asp?a=blog&amp;bid=786" rel="nofollow">EVE online</a> developers might fit.</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.stackless.com/" rel="nofollow">Stackless Python</a> is an enhanced
  version of the Python programming
  language. It allows programmers to
  reap the benefits of thread-based
  programming without the performance
  and complexity problems associated
  with conventional threads. The
  microthreads that Stackless adds to
  Python are a cheap and lightweight
  convenience, which if used properly,
  can not only serve as a way to
  structure an application or framework,
  but by doing so improve program
  structure and facilitate more readable
  code.</p>

<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Take the hint.  CPU intensive programs can also be made into multiple processes.  Multiple processes and a pipeline to pass status around can often have outstanding performance.</p>

<p>Rather than fish around randomly for other languages, do this.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Decompose the problem into a pipeline of steps that can be done concurrently.</p>

<p>In the shell, the top-level script is this: <code>a.py | b.py | c.py | d.py</code>...</p></li>
<li><p>Write each step as a very small Python loop that reads from <code>sys.stdin</code> and writes to <code>sys.stdout</code>.  Interesting, this is the default for <code>raw_input()</code> and <code>print()</code> making things simple.</p></li>
<li><p>Measure the performance.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You'll -- correctly -- spend all your time designing your algorithm.  You'll spend little time coding or learning a new language.  You'll trivially tie up every core on every CPU available to you.  You'll spend no time on thread synchronization or other foolishness.</p>

<p>This kind of thing works very, very well for "CPU Intensive" applications.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>You could just use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html" rel="nofollow">python multiprocessing</a> it mirrors the API of threading but runs separate processes. Might not be implemented for non-posix. For general CPU intensive problems you could always try <a href="http://www.stackless.com/" rel="nofollow">Stackless Python</a> (mentioned already) or <a href="http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/greg.ewing/python/Pyrex/" rel="nofollow">Pyrex</a>.</p>
