<h3>Question (ID-112970):</h3><h2>Python - When to use file vs open</h2><p>What's the difference between file and open in Python?  When should I use which one?  (Say I'm in 2.5)</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You should always use <code>open()</code>.</p>

<p>As the <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/built-in-funcs.html" rel="nofollow" title="BuiltinFuncs Doc">documentation</a> states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When opening a file, it's preferable
  to use open() instead of invoking this
  constructor directly. file is more
  suited to type testing (for example,
  writing "isinstance(f, file)").</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, python 3.0 will have <code>file()</code> <a href="http://docs.python.org/dev/3.0/whatsnew/3.0.html#other-language-changes" rel="nofollow" title="Changes">removed</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Two reasons: The python philosophy of "There ought to be one way to do it" and <code>file</code> is going away.</p>

<p><code>file</code> is the actual type (using e.g. <code>file('myfile.txt')</code> is calling its constructor). <code>open</code> is a factory function that will return a file object.</p>

<p>In python 3.0 <code>file</code> is going to move from being a built-in to being implemented by multiple classes in the <code>io</code> library (somewhat similar to Java with buffered readers, etc.)</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>'file' is a type, like an int or a list. 'open' is a function for opening files, and will return a 'file' object.</p>

<p>This is an example of when you should use open:</p>

<pre><code>f = open(filename, 'r')
for line in f:
    process(line)
f.close()
</code></pre>

<p>This is an example of when you should use file:</p>

<pre><code>class LoggingFile(file):
    def write(self, data):
        sys.stderr.write("Wrote %d bytes\n" % len(data))
        super(LoggingFile, self).write(data)
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, there's a good reason for both to exist, and a clear use-case for both.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Functionally, the two are the same; <code>open</code> will call <code>file</code> anyway, so currently the difference is a matter of style. The <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/built-in-funcs.html" rel="nofollow">Python docs</a> recommend using <code>open</code>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When opening a file, it's preferable to use open() instead of invoking the file constructor directly. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reason is that in future versions they is not guaranteed to be the same (<code>open</code> will become a factory function, which returns objects of  different types depending on the path it's opening).</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Only ever use open() for opening files. file() is actually being removed in 3.0, and it's deprecated at the moment. They've had a sort of strange relationship, but file() is going now, so there's no need to worry anymore.</p>

<p>The following is from the Python 2.6 docs. [bracket stuff] added by me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When opening a file, itâ€™s preferable to use open() instead of invoking this [file()] constructor directly. file is more suited to type testing (for example, writing isinstance(f, file)</p>
</blockquote>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>According to Mr Van Rossum, although open() is currently an alias for file() you should use open() because this might change in the future.</p>
