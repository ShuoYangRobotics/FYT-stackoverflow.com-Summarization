<h3>Question (ID-1191689):</h3><h2>Hierarchical Bayes for R or Python</h2><p>Hierarchical Bayes models are commonly used in Marketing, Political Science, and Econometrics. Yet, the only package I know of is <code>bayesm</code>, which is really a companion to a book (<em>Bayesian Statistics and Marketing</em>, by Rossi, et al.) Am I missing something? Is there a software package for R or Python doing the job out there, and/or a worked-out example in the associated language? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>There's OpenBUGS and R helper packages.  Check out Gelman's site for his book, which has most of the relevant links:</p>

<p>On the Python side, I only know of PyMC:</p>

<p>EDIT:  Added a link to the appropriate appendix from Gelman's book, available online, for an example using R and BUGS.  </p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Here are four books on hierarchical modeling and bayesian analysis written with R code throughout the books.</p>

<p>Hierarchical Modeling and Analysis for Spatial Data (Monographs on Statistics and Applied Probability) (Hardcover)
<a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/158488410X" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/158488410X</a></p>

<p>Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models (Paperback)
<a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/052168689X" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Analysis-Regression-Multilevel-Hierarchical-Models/dp/052168689X/ref=pd_sim_b_1</a></p>

<p>Bayesian Computation with R (Use R) (Paperback)
<a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0387922970" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Bayesian-Computation-R-Use/dp/0387922970/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_c</a></p>

<p>Hierarchical Modelling for the Environmental Sciences: Statistical Methods and Applications (Oxford Biology) (Paperback) (I'm assuming this one has R code as both authors use R extensively)</p>

<p>I know some python books dabble in multivariate analysis (Collective Intelligence, for example) but I haven't seen any that really delve into bayesian or hierarchical modeling.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>There are a few hierarchical models in <a href="http://mcmcpack.wustl.edu" rel="nofollow">MCMCpack</a> for R, which to my knowledge is the fastest sampler for many common model types. (I wrote the [hierarchical item response][2] model in it.)</p>

<p>[RJAGS][3] does what its name sounds like. Code up a jags-flavored .bug model, provide data in R, and call Jags from R.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>in python, try PyMC.  There is an example of multilevel modeling with it here:  <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/pymc/browse%5Fthread/thread/c6ce37a80edf7f85/1bfd9138c8db891d" rel="nofollow">http://groups.google.com/group/pymc/browse%5Fthread/thread/c6ce37a80edf7f85/1bfd9138c8db891d</a></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I apply hierarchical Bayes models in R in combination with JAGS (Linux) or sometimes WinBUGS (Windows, or Wine).  Check out the book of Andrew Gelman, as referred to above.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>The lme4 package, which estimates hierarchical models using frequentist methods, has a function called mcmcsamp that allows you to sample from the posterior distribution of the model using MCMC. This currently  works only for linear models, quite unfortunately.</p>
