<h3>Question (ID-4338474):</h3><h2>Python Object awareness of being in an array?</h2><p>Is there a way in Python for an object to <strong>'know'</strong> what its array element id is? I.e 6  in an array, and the object itself prints out its own array element number, so '0,1,2,3,4,5'</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>In a word, no...</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>No. The object could be inside everything and multiple objects at the same time, so it can't know unless you tell it.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Just to be pedantic: in general, no...
but technically it is <em>possible</em> for some (specific) objects, which are part of some arrays to "know their position"...</p>

<pre><code>class HelpfulClass(object):
  def __init__(self):
    self.arr = []

  def add(self, obj):
    pos = len(self.arr) + 1
    self.arr.append(obj)
    obj.pos = pos

class SmartObj(object):
  def __init__(self):
    self.pos = None

  def print_my_element(self):
    print self.pos

if __name__ == '__main__':
  s = HelpfulClass()
  o = SmartObj()
  s.add(o)

  o.print_my_element()  
</code></pre>

<p>...technically 'o' is an object...and part of an array (s.arr)...and "knows" it's position...</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Not unless you tell it, and telling it leads to very annoying coupling and/or separation of responsibility problems. What are you <strong>really</strong> trying to do?</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>No, but you can use the 'enumerate' builtin to iterate over the index and the element at the same time:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = ['a','b','c']
&gt;&gt;&gt; for index,element in enumerate(x):
...     print index,element
... 
0 a
1 b
2 c
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>If the object knows the list it is part of, it could find out by doing <code>the_list.index(self)</code>.  Otherwise, no.</p>
