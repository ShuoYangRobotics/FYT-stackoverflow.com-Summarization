<h3>Question (ID-685533):</h3><h2>python convert microsoft office docs to plain text on linux</h2><p>Any recomendations on a method to convert .doc, .ppt, and .xls to plain text on linux using python? Really any method of conversion would be useful. I have already looked at using Open Office but, I would like a solution that does not require having to install Open Office.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I'd go for the command line-solution (and then use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/subprocess.html" rel="nofollow">Python subprocess module</a> to run the tools from Python).</p>

<p>Convertors for msword (<strong>catdoc</strong>), excel (<strong>xls2csv</strong>) and ppt (<strong>catppt</strong>) can be found (in source form) here: <a href="http://vitus.wagner.pp.ru/software/catdoc/" rel="nofollow">http://vitus.wagner.pp.ru/software/catdoc/</a>.</p>

<p>Can't really comment on the usefullness of catppt but catdoc and xls2csv work great!</p>

<p>But be sure to first search your distributions repositories... On ubuntu for example catdoc is just one fast apt-get away.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>The usual tool for converting Microsoft Office documents to HTML or other formats was mswordview, which has since been renamed to <a href="http://wvware.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">vwWare</a>.</p>

<p>If you're looking for a command-line tool, they actually recommend using AbiWord to perform the conversion:</p>

<pre><code>AbiWord --to=txt
</code></pre>

<p>If you're looking for a library, start on the <a href="http://wvware.sourceforge.net/wvWare.html" rel="nofollow">wvWare overview page</a>. They also maintain <a href="http://wvware.sourceforge.net/wvInfo.html" rel="nofollow">a list of libraries and tools which read MS Office documents</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>For dealing with Excel Spreadsheets <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlwt" rel="nofollow">xlwt</a> is good.  But it won't help with <code>.doc</code> and <code>.ppt</code> files.</p>

<p>(You may have also heard of PyExcelerator.  xlwt is a fork of this and better maintained so I think you'd be better of with xlwt.)</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>At the command line, <a href="http://www.winfield.demon.nl/" rel="nofollow">antiword</a> or <a href="http://wvware.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">wv</a> work very nicely for .doc files. (Not a Python solution, but they're easy to install and fast.)</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Same problem here. Below is my simple script to convert all doc files in dir 'docs/' to dir 'txts/' using catdoc. Hope it will help someone:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python 
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

import glob, re, os
f = glob.glob('docs/*.doc') + glob.glob('docs/*.DOC')

outDir = 'txts'
if not os.path.exists(outDir):
    os.makedirs(outDir)
for i in f:
    os.system("catdoc -w '%s' &gt; '%s'" %
              (i, outDir + '/' + re.sub(r'.*/([^.]+)\.doc', r'\1.txt', i,
                                   flags=re.IGNORECASE)))
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I've had some success at using XSLT to process the XML-based office files into something usable in the past. It's not necessarily a python-based solution, but it does get the job done.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Interestingly enough, it looks like if you use OpenOffice to create a .ppt file, (saving it as Microsoft PowerPoint 97/2000/XP), then catppt will fail to extract the words from it.  </p>
