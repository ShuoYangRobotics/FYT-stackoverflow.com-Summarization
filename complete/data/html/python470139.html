<h3>Question (ID-470139):</h3><h2>Why does 1+++2 = 3 in python?</h2><p>I am from C background and I just started learning python... </p>

<p>while trying some programs, I got this doubt...</p>

<p>how python evaluates the expression 1+++2?</p>

<p>No matter how many number of '+' I put in between, it is printing 3 as the answer. Please can anyone explain this behavior</p>

<p>and for 1--2 it is printing 3 and for 1---2 it is printing -1 </p>

<p>please clear my doubt.</p>

<p>Regards</p>

<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Your expression is the same as:</p>

<pre><code>1+(+(+2))
</code></pre>

<p>Any numeric expression can be preceded by <code>-</code> to make it negative, or <code>+</code> to do nothing (the option is present for symmetry). With negative signs:</p>

<pre><code>1-(-(2)) = 1-(-2)
         = 1+2
         = 3
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>1-(-(-2)) = 1-(2)
          = -1
</code></pre>

<p>I see you clarified your question to say that you come from a C background. In Python, there are no increment operators like <code>++</code> and <code>--</code> in C, which was probably the source of your confusion. To increment or decrement a variable i in Python use this style:</p>

<pre><code>i += 1
j -= 1
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The extra +'s are not incrementors (like ++a or a++ in c++).  They are just showing that the number is positive.</p>

<p>There is no such ++ operator.  There is a unary + operator and a unary - operator though.  The unary + operator has no effect on its argument. The unary - operator negates its operator or mulitplies it by -1. </p>

<pre><code>+1
</code></pre>

<p>-> 1</p>

<pre><code>++1
</code></pre>

<p>-> 1</p>

<p>This is the same as +(+(1))</p>

<pre><code>   1+++2
</code></pre>

<p>-> 3
Because it's the same as 1 + (+(+(2))</p>

<p>Likewise you can do --1 to mean - (-1)  which is +1.</p>

<pre><code>  --1
</code></pre>

<p>-> 1</p>

<p>For completeness there is no * unary opeartor.  So *1 is an error.  But there is a ** 
operator which is power of, it takes 2 arguments. </p>

<pre><code> 2**3
</code></pre>

<p>-> 8</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>1+(+(+2)) = 3</p>

<p>1 - (-2) = 3</p>

<p>1 - (-(-2)) = -1</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Trying <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/expressions.html#unary-arithmetic-operations" rel="nofollow">Unary Plus and Unary minus</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The unary - (minus) operator yields the negation of its numeric argument.</p>
  
  <p>The unary + (plus) operator yields its numeric argument unchanged.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; +2
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; ++2
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; +++2
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; -2
-2
&gt;&gt;&gt; --2
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; ---2
-2
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1+(++2)
3
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I believe it's being parsed as, the first + as a binary operation (add), and the rest as unary operations (make positive). </p>

<pre><code> 1 + (+(+2))
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Think it as 1 + (+1*(+1*2))). The first + is operator and following plus signs are sign of second operand (= 2).</p>

<p>Just like 1---2 is same as 1 - -(-(2)) or 1- (-1*(-1*(2))</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>It's simple. There are no post-incrementation or post-decrementation operators in Python.</p>
