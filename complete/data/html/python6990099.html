<h3>Question (ID-6990099):</h3><h2>Explaining the python 'self' variable to a beginner</h2><p>I'm pretty much ignorant of OOP jargon and concepts. I know conceptually what an object is, and that objects have methods. I even understand that in python, classes are objects! That's cool, I just don't know what it means. It isn't clicking with me.</p>

<p>I'm currently trying to understand a few detailed answers that I think will illuminate my understanding of python:</p>

<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/231767/the-python-yield-keyword-explained/231855#231855">The Python yield keyword explained</a></li>

</ol>

<p>In the first answer, the author uses the following code as an example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class Bank(): # let's create a bank, building ATMs
...    crisis = False
...    def create_atm(self) :
...        while not self.crisis :
...            yield "$100"
</code></pre>

<p>I don't immediately grok what <code>self</code> is pointing to. This is definitely a symptom of not understanding classes, which I will work on at some point. To clarify, in </p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def func():
...   for i in range(3):
...     print i
</code></pre>

<p>I understand that <code>i</code> points to an item in the list <code>range(3)</code> which, since it is in a function, isn't global. But what does <code>self</code> "point to"?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>It may help you to think of the <code>obj.method(arg1, arg2)</code> invocation syntax as purely syntactic sugar for calling <code>method(obj, arg1, arg2)</code> (except that <code>method</code> is looked up via <code>obj</code>'s type, and isn't global).</p>

<p>If you view it that way, <code>obj</code> is the first argument to the function, which traditionally is named <code>self</code> in the parameter list. (You can, in fact, name it something else, and your code will work correctly, but other Python coders will frown at you.)</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I'll try to clear up some confusion about classes and objects for you first. "classes are objects!" is very far from the truth.</p>

<p>Lets look at this block of code:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class Bank(): # let's create a bank, building ATMs
...    crisis = False
...    def create_atm(self) :
...        while not self.crisis :
...            yield "$100"
</code></pre>

<p>The comment there is a bit deceptive. The above code does not "create" a bank. It defines what a bank is. A bank is something which has a property called <code>crisis</code>, and a function <code>create_atm</code>. That's what the above code says.</p>

<p>Now let's actually create a bank:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = Bank()
</code></pre>

<p>There, x is now a bank. x has a property <code>crisis</code> and a function <code>create_atm</code>. Calling <code>x.create_atm();</code> in python is the same as calling <code>Bank.create_atm(x);</code>, so now self refers to x. If you have more than one Bank, calling <code>y.create_atm()</code> will know to look at y's value of crisis, not x's since in that function <code>self</code> refers to <code>y</code>.</p>

<p><code>self</code> is just a naming convention, but it is very good to stick with it. It's still worth pointing out that the code above is equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class Bank(): # let's create a bank, building ATMs
...    crisis = False
...    def create_atm(thisbank) :
...        while not thisbank.crisis :
...            yield "$100"
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><code>self</code> refers to an instance of the class.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p><code>self</code> refers to the current instance of <code>Bank</code>.  When you create a new <code>Bank</code>, and call <code>create_atm</code> on it, <code>self</code> will be implicitly passed by python, and will refer to the bank you created.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><blockquote>
  <p>I don't immediately grok what <code>self</code> is pointing to. This is definitely a symptom of not understanding classes, which I will work on at some point.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>self</code> is an argument passed in to the function.  In Python, this first argument is implicitly the object that the method was invoked on.  In other words:</p>

<pre><code>class Bar(object):
    def someMethod(self):
        return self.field

bar = Bar()

bar.someMethod()
Bar.someMethod(bar)
</code></pre>

<p>These last two lines have equivalent behavior.  (Unless <code>bar</code> refers to an object of a subclass of <code>Bar</code> -- then <code>someMethod()</code> might refer to a different function object.)</p>

<p>Note that you can name the "special" first argument <em>anything you want</em> -- <code>self</code> is just a convention for methods.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I understand that <code>i</code> points to an item in the list <code>range(3)</code> which, since it is in a function, isn't global. But what does <code>self</code> "point to"?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The name <code>self</code> does not exist in the context of that function.  Attempting to use it would raise a <code>NameError</code>.</p>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>"<em>self</em>" is the instance object <strong>automatically</strong> passed to the class instance's method when called, to identify the instance that called it.  "<em>self</em>" is used to access other attributes or methods of the object from inside the method.  (methods are basically just functions that belong to a class)</p>

<p>"<em>self</em>" does not need to be used when calling a method when you already have an available instance.</p>

<p>Accessing the "some_attribute" attribute from inside a method:</p>

<pre><code>class MyClass(object):
    some_attribute = "hello"

    def some_method(self, some_string):
        print self.some_attribute + " " + some_string
</code></pre>

<p>Accessing the "some_attribute" attribute from an existing instance:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; # create the instance
&gt;&gt;&gt; inst = MyClass()
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; # accessing the attribute
&gt;&gt;&gt; inst.some_attribute
"hello"
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; # calling the instance's method
&gt;&gt;&gt; inst.some_method("world") # In addition to "world", inst is *automatically* passed here as the first argument to "some_method".
hello world
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>Here is a little code to demonstrate that self is the same as the instance:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class MyClass(object):
&gt;&gt;&gt;     def whoami(self, inst):
&gt;&gt;&gt;         print self is inst
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; local_instance = MyClass()

&gt;&gt;&gt; local_instance.whoami(local_instance)
True
</code></pre>

<p>As mentioned by others, it's named "<em>self</em>" by convention, but it could be named anything.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>The reason "self" is there (by convention) is that when the Python runtime sees a call of the form Object.Method(Param1,Param2), it calls Method with parameters (Object,Param1,Param2).  So if you call that first parameter "self", everyone will know what you are talking about.  </p>

<p>The reason you have to do this is the subject of another question.</p>

<p>As far as a metaclass, it's something rarely used.  You might want to look at:

He also has a nice article on some possible uses, but most people never directly use it at all.</p>
