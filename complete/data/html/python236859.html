<h3>Question (ID-236859):</h3><h2>Any python libs for parsing Bind zone files?</h2><p>Any python libs for parsing Bind zone files? 
Basically something that will aid in adding/removing zones and records.
This needs to work even if someone modifies the zone file by hand so overwriting the zone files every time is not a solution.  </p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I was unable to use bicop for classical zone files like these:</p>

<pre><code>    $TTL 86400
@   IN SOA ns1.first-ns.de. postmaster.robot.first-ns.de. (
    2006040800   ; serial
    14400        ; refresh
    1800         ; retry
    604800       ; expire
    86400 )      ; minimum

@

                    IN NS      ns1.first-ns.de.

<p>I will have a look at <a href="http://www.dnspython.com/" rel="nofollow">dnspython</a></p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You might try <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bicop" rel="nofollow"><code>bicop</code></a>, "a python library to process ISC bind-style configuration files".</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I know this is old but the only working one I could find is called iscpy. You can do an easy_install.</p>

<pre><code>easy_install iscpy
</code></pre>

<p>Then in python:</p>

<pre><code>import iscpy
iscpy.ParseISCString(open('somefile.conf', 'r').read())
</code></pre>

<p>Which returns a dictionary.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>See answer above about bicop.</p>

<p>As an aside, the Python Package Index at <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi" rel="nofollow">http://pypi.python.org/pypi</a> is a great place to look for Python packages.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: The below may still be helpful to someone trying to figure out simple parsing, but bicop is apparently an existing solution.</p>

<p>If someone has modified the config by hand, and you don't want to overwrite it, does that imply that you wish to insert/remove lines from an existing config, leaving all comments etc intact?  That does prevent parsing then re-outputting the config, but that's a positive as well -- you don't need to fully parse the file to accomplish your goal.</p>

<p>To add a record, you might try a simple approach like</p>

<pre><code># define zone_you_care_about and line_you_wish_to_insert first, then:
for line in bindfile.read():
    out.write(line + '\n')
    if ('zone "%s" in' % zone_you_care_about) in line:
        out.write(line_you_wish_to_insert)
</code></pre>

<p>Similar code works for removing a line:</p>

<pre><code># define zone_you_care_about and relevant_text_to_remove, then:
for line in bindfile.read():
    if not relevant_text_to_remove in line:
        out.write(line + '\n')
</code></pre>

<p>You may get as far as you need with simple snippets of code like this.</p>
