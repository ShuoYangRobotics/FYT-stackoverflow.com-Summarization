<h3>Question (ID-856948):</h3><h2>arrays in python</h2><p>Hi I just started work on my first python script
What's the best way to create 2 D arrays in python ?
What I want is want is to store values like this :
 X , Y , Z
so that I access date like X[2],Y[2],Z[2] or X[n]Y[n],Z[n] where n is varialble
I don't know in the beginning how big n would be so I would to append values at the end</p>

&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in xrange(3):
...     a.append([])
...     for j in xrange(3):
...             a[i].append(i+j)
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
[[0, 1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4]]

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>In Python one would usually use <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow">lists</a> for this purpose. Lists can be nested arbitrarily, thus allowing the creation of a 2D array. Not every sublist needs to be the same size, so that solves your other problem. Have a look at the examples I linked to.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If you want to do some serious work with arrays then you should use the <a href="http://numpy.scipy.org/" rel="nofollow">numpy library</a>. This will allow you for example to do vector addition and matrix multiplication, and for large arrays it is much faster than Python lists. </p>

<p>However, numpy requires that the size is predefined. Of course you can also store numpy arrays in a list, like:</p>

<pre><code>import numpy as np
vec_list = [np.zeros((3,)) for _ in range(10)]
vec_list.append(np.array([1,2,3]))
vec_sum = vec_list[0] + vec_list[1]  # possible because we use numpy
print vec_list[10][2]  # prints 3
</code></pre>

<p>But since your numpy arrays are pretty small I guess there is some overhead compared to using a tuple. It all depends on your priorities.</p>

<p>See also this other <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/261006/multidimensional-array-python">question</a>, which is pretty similar (apart from the variable size).</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Depending what you're doing, you may not really have a 2-D array.</p>

<p>80% of the time you have simple list of "row-like objects", which might be proper sequences.</p>

<pre><code>myArray = [ ('pi',3.14159,'r',2), ('e',2.71828,'theta',.5) ]

myArray[0][1] == 3.14159
myArray[1][1] == 2.71828
</code></pre>

<p>More often, they're instances of a class or a dictionary or a set or something more interesting that you didn't have in your previous languages.</p>

<pre><code>myArray = [ {'pi':3.1415925,'r':2}, {'e':2.71828,'theta':.5} ]
</code></pre>

<p>20% of the time you have a dictionary, keyed by a pair</p>

<pre><code>myArray = { (2009,'aug'):(some,tuple,of,values), (2009,'sep'):(some,other,tuple) }
</code></pre>

<p>Rarely, will you actually need a matrix.</p>

<p>You have a large, large number of collection classes in Python. Odds are good that you have something more interesting than a matrix.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I would suggest that you use a dictionary like so:</p>

<pre><code>arr = {}

arr[1] = (1, 2, 4)
arr[18] = (3, 4, 5)

print(arr[1])
&gt;&gt;&gt; (1, 2, 4)
</code></pre>

<p>If you're not sure an entry is defined in the dictionary, you'll need a validation mechanism when calling "arr[x]", e.g. try-except.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>If you are concerned about memory footprint, the Python standard library contains the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/array.html" rel="nofollow">array module</a>; these arrays contain elements of the same type.</p>
