<h3>Question (ID-2473983):</h3><h2>Calculate Matrix Rank using scipy</h2><p>I'd like to calculate the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_%28linear_algebra%29" rel="nofollow">mathematical rank</a> of a matrix using scipy. The most obvious function <code>numpy.rank</code> calculates the dimension of an array (ie. scalars have dimension 0, vectors 1, matrices 2, etc...). I am aware that the <code>numpy.linalg.lstsq</code> module has this capability, but I was wondering if such a fundamental operation is built into the matrix class somewhere.</p>

<p>Here is an explicit example:</p>

<pre><code>from numpy import matrix, rank
A = matrix([[1,3,7],[2,8,3],[7,8,1]])
print rank(A)
</code></pre>

<p>This gives <code>2</code> the dimension, where I'm looking for an answer of <code>3</code>. </p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>To provide a rough code snippet for people who need to get this done in practice.  Feel free to improve.</p>

<pre><code>u, s, v = np.linalg.svd(A)
rank = np.sum(s &gt; 1e-10)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The answer is noâ€”there is currently no function dedicated to calculating the matrix rank of an array/matrix in scipy. Adding one has been discussed before, but if it's going to happen, I don't believe it has yet.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If <code>numpy</code> does not offer a rank facility, why don't you write your own?</p>

<p>An efficient way to compute the rank is via the Singular Value Decomposition - the rank of the matrix is equal to the number of non-zero singular values.</p>

<pre><code>def rank(A, eps=1e-12):
    u, s, vh = numpy.linalg.svd(A)
     return len([x for x in s if abs(x) &gt; eps])
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that <code>eps</code> depends in your application - most would agree that 1e-12 corresponds to zero, but you may witness numerical instability even for eps=1e-9.</p>

<p>Using your example, the answer is three. If you change the second row to <code>[2, 6, 14]</code> (linearly dependent with row one) the answer is two (the "zero" eigenvalue is 4.9960E-16)</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I don't know about Numpy in particular, but that's unlikely to be a built-in operation on a matrix; it involves fairly intensive numerical computations (and associated concerns about floating-point roundoff error and so forth) and threshold selections that may or may not be appropriate in a given context, and algorithm selection is important to computing it accurately and quickly.</p>

<p>Things that are built into the basic classes tend to be things that can be performed in a unique and straightforward manner, such as matrix multiplications at the most complex.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>The <strong>linear algebra functions are generally grouped in <code>numpy.linalg</code></strong>. (They're also available from <code>scipy.linalg</code>, which has more functionality.) This allows polymorphism: the functions can accept any of the types that SciPy handles.</p>

<p>So, yes, <strong>the <code>numpy.linalg.lstsq</code> function</strong> does what you're asking. Why is that insufficient?</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Numpy provides <code>numpy.linalg.matrix_rank()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import numpy
&gt;&gt;&gt; numpy.__version__
'1.5.1'
&gt;&gt;&gt; A = numpy.matrix([[1,3,7],[2,8,3],[7,8,1]])
&gt;&gt;&gt; numpy.linalg.matrix_rank(A)
3
</code></pre>
