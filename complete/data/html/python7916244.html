<h3>Question (ID-7916244):</h3><h2>Best way to integrate Python code with HTML</h2><p>This is the first time I've tried to integrate Python and HTML. I have mod_python installed on my Apache server, and I'm wondering if there's a specific way I should run a script, or if I should (can I?) put the code directly in the HTML.</p>

<p>What are the best ways of using Python through HTML?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The best way is to set up a web framework that uses Python. Some good choices are <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" rel="nofollow">Django</a>, <a href="http://turbogears.org/" rel="nofollow">TurboGears</a>, and <a href="http://docs.pylonsproject.org/" rel="nofollow">Pyramid</a>. While it is possible to do pure Python CGI or as an ISAPI extension, you don't really gain much from that approach, and a web framework is bound to be more efficient, understandable, and helpful.</p>

<p>Furthermore, web frameworks come with a philosophy and contain a lot of careful thought and best practices that you can learn from while you're working.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>If your just looking to generate static pages, then all you need is a template language.</p>

<p><a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/api/#basics" rel="nofollow">Jinja2</a> is pretty well liked.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>As far as I know, there is no way you can just slap the code in your HTML like PHP (it's a good thing).</p>

<p>If you're looking for a simple way to get started, look into <a href="http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/" rel="nofollow">Bottle</a>
It's a very simple framework that allows you to use templates and process requests.</p>

<p>When you start getting into something more complex relating Web Development, and if you stick to Python, I would advice you to check out <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" rel="nofollow">Django</a>, which is a very complete web framework built on Python.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Use one of the many <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/WebFrameworks" rel="nofollow">Web Frameworks for Python</a>.
I prefer <a href="http://webpy.org/" rel="nofollow">web.py</a></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I used Mod_Python with Python Server Pages.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Ive recently been introduced to this myself.</p>

<p>Ive been using Pylons MVC on Linux and its incredibly easy to use. Im not sure how to do it on Windows (Ill assume thats what you are using) but the MVC elements are very easy to follow and modify.</p>

<p>Using Python code within HTML is just a matter of using the right syntax. Mostly you just use loops and global objects:</p>

<pre><code>%if c.data:
    &lt;p&gt;${c.data}&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
    %for i in c.data:
        &lt;td&gt;${i.dataChild}&lt;/td&gt;
    %endfor
    &lt;/tr&gt;
%else:
    &lt;p&gt;NO DATA!&lt;/p&gt;
%endif
</code></pre>
