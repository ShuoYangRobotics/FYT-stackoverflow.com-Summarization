<h3>Question (ID-1233655):</h3><h2>What is the simplest way to SSH using Python?</h2><p>What is the absolute simplest way to SSH to a remote server from a local Python (3.0) script, supply a login/password, execute a command and print the output to the Python console? I would rather not use any large external library and not install anything on the remote server.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You can code it yourself using Paramiko, as suggested above. Alternatively, you can look into Fabric, a python application for doing all the things you asked about:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fabric is a Python library and
  command-line tool designed to
  streamline deploying applications or
  performing system administration tasks
  via the SSH protocol. It provides
  tools for running arbitrary shell
  commands (either as a normal login
  user, or via sudo), uploading and
  downloading files, and so forth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this fits your needs. It is also not a large library and requires no server installation, although it does have dependencies on paramiko and pycrypt that require installation on the client.</p>

<p>The app used to be <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/fab/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. It can now be found <a href="http://docs.fabfile.org/0.9/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<pre><code>* The official, canonical repository is git.fabfile.org
* The official Github mirror is GitHub/bitprophet/fabric
</code></pre>

<p>There are several good articles on it, though you should be careful because it has changed in the last six months:</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I haven't tried it, but this <a href="http://commandline.org.uk/python/sftp-python-really-simple-ssh/">ssh module</a> might help, which in turn uses paramiko. I believe everything is client-side.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Ostensibly, the link to the code accompanying the above blog post is broken, and looking through the blog's comments it seems it has made its way to a proper Python package, <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pysftp/">pysftp</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If you want to avoid any extra modules, you can use the subprocess module to run</p>

<pre><code>ssh [host] [command]
</code></pre>

<p>and capture the output. </p>

<p>Try something like:</p>

<pre><code>process = subprocess.Popen("ssh example.com ls", shell=True,
    stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)
output,stderr = process.communicate()
status = process.poll()
print output
</code></pre>

<p>To deal with usernames and passwords, you can use subprocess to interact with the ssh process, or you could install a public key on the server to avoid the password prompt.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Your definition of "simplest" is important here - simple code means using a module (though "large external library" is an exaggeration).</p>

<p>I believe the most up-to-date (actively developed) module is <a href="http://www.lag.net/paramiko/" rel="nofollow">paramiko</a>. It comes with demo scripts in the download, and has detailed online API documentation. You could also try <a href="http://pexpect.sourceforge.net/pxssh.html" rel="nofollow">PxSSH</a>, which is contained in <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pexpect/" rel="nofollow">pexpect</a>. There's a short sample along with the documentation at the first link. </p>

<p>Again with respect to simplicity, note that good error-detection is always going to make your code look more complex, but you should be able to reuse a lot of code from the sample scripts then forget about it.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I have written <a href="http://www.no-ack.org/2010/11/python-bindings-for-libssh2.html">Python bindings for libssh2</a>. Libssh2 is a client-side library implementing the SSH2 protocol.</p>

<pre><code>import socket
import libssh2

sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
sock.connect(('exmaple.com', 22))

session = libssh2.Session()
session.startup(sock)
session.userauth_password('john', '******')

channel = session.channel()
channel.execute('ls -l')

print channel.read(1024)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Like hughdbrown, I like Fabric. Please notice that while it implement its own declarative scripting (for making deploys and the such) it can also be imported as a Python module and used on your programs without having to write a Fabric script.</p>

<p>Fabric has a new maintainer and is in the process of being rewriten; that means that most tutorials you'll (currently) find on the web will not work with the current version. Also, Google still shows the old Fabric page as the first result. </p>
