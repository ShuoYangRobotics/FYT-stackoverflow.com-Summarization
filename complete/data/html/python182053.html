<h3>Question (ID-182053):</h3><h2>Setup Python enviroment on windows</h2><p>How do I setup a Python enviroment on windows computer so I can start writing and running Python scripts, is there an install bundle?  Also which database should i use?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>Sorry I should of mentioned that I am using this for web based applications. Does it require apache? or does it use another http server? What is the standard setup for Python running web apps?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Download the Python 2.6 Windows installer from <a href="http://python.org/" rel="nofollow">python.org</a> (<a href="http://python.org/ftp/python/2.6/python-2.6.msi" rel="nofollow">direct link</a>). If you're just learning, use the included SQLite library so you don't have to fiddle with database servers.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>Most web development frameworks (Django, Turbogears, etc) come with a built-in webserver command that runs on the local computer without Apache.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><strong>Bundle</strong>: go with Activestate's Python, which bundles many useful win32-related libraries. It has no version 2.6 yet, but most code you'll find online refers to 2.5 and lower anyway.</p>

<p><strong>Database</strong>: any of the popular open-source DBs are simple to configure. But as John already suggested, for simple beginning stuff just use SQLite which already comes bundled with Python.</p>

<p><strong>Web server</strong>: depends on the scale. You can configure Apache, yes, but for trying simple things the following is a quite complete web server in Python that will also serve CGI scripts writte in Python:</p>

<pre><code>import CGIHTTPServer
import BaseHTTPServer

class Handler(CGIHTTPServer.CGIHTTPRequestHandler):
    cgi_directories = ["/cgi"]

PORT = 9999

httpd = BaseHTTPServer.HTTPServer(("", PORT), Handler)
print "serving at port", PORT
httpd.serve_forever()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I strongly recommend <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/activepython/index.mhtml" rel="nofollow">ActiveState Python</a> for python on windows development.  It comes with Win32Com and various other goodies, has a mature and clean installer, a chm version of the docs and works really well.  I use this all of the time.</p>

<p>As for a database, Activestate comes with odbc support, which plays very nicely with SQL server.  I've also had it working with Sybase and DB2/400 (although the connection strings for the latter tend to be rather convoluted).  For Oracle, I recommend <a href="http://python.net/crew/atuining/cx_Oracle/" rel="nofollow">CX_Oracle</a> as the best interface library.  Native drivers for most proprietary and open-source databases (such as <a href="http://mysql-python.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">MySQL</a> and <a href="http://www.pygresql.org/" rel="nofollow">PostGreSQL</a>) also exist.  Recent versions of Python (from 2.5 onwards IIRC) come with <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/lib/module-sqlite3.html" rel="nofollow">SQLite</a> bundled as standard.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Don't forget to install <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/" rel="nofollow">pywin32</a> after installing the official (command line) installer. This will define additional <em>start menu</em> items and the highly useful <em>PythonWin IDE</em>.</p>

<p>An installer for both is available at <a href="http://activestate.com/Products/activepython/index.mhtml" rel="nofollow">Activestate</a> (no 2.6 yet). The Activestate distribution contains additional documentation.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Might I suggest taking a look at <a href="http://karrigell.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">Karrigell</a>? It's really a nice Python web framework if you don't require everything Django and Turbogears offers. It might be easier for you to work with web frameworks until you get comfortable with them.</p>

<p>For development, I recommend downloading the latest <a href="http://pythonide.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">SPE</a> IDE. It should provide you nearly all the tools you will need, plus it includes wxGlade for GUI development.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Django tutorial <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/install/" rel="nofollow">How to install Django</a> provides a good example how a web-development Python environment may look.</p>
