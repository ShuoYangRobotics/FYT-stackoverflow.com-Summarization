<h3>Question (ID-904212):</h3><h2>Where can I find Python tutorials aimed at people who are already programmers?</h2><p>I'm a reasonably skilled programmer, and I'm interested in branching out into some new languages -- python, specifically -- but frankly I do NOT want to go through a tutorial that assumes I know nothing about programming.  I want a tutorial -- again, preferably for python -- that assumes I'm just unfamiliar with the language itself and describes the ways I can use the language to solve problems.</p>

<p>Does such a beast exist?  I mean, other than <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers" rel="nofollow">the Python wiki</a>?</p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I recently wrote a paper for Linux Magazine (France) on learning Python, and I had to ask myself the same question and do a thorough research on this.  My recommendation is to check the sources below in the following order:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://hetland.org/writing/instant-python.html" rel="nofollow">Instant Python</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.poromenos.org/tutorials/python" rel="nofollow">Learn Python in 10 minutes</a></li>
<li><a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/" rel="nofollow">The official tutorial</a> (to be skimmed through)</li>
<li><a href="http://homepage.mac.com/s_lott/books/python.html" rel="nofollow">Building Skills in Python: A Programmer's Introduction to Python</a>, by Stack Overflow contributor S. Lott</li>
<li><a href="http://diveintopython.org/index.html" rel="nofollow">Dive into Python</a> is quite good too, but is limited to the now quite old Python 2.3.</li>
</ol>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I will also recomment you to read the python cookbook, a really nice book full of recipes that will help you on several tasks.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I would suggest the following Books, these are all for Python 2</p>

<p>1). "A Byte of Python"</p>

<p>2). "Python 101 -- Introduction to Python"</p>

<p>3). "Building Skills in Python --- A Programmer's Introduction to Python"</p>

<p>4). "Python 201 -- (Slightly) Advanced Python Topics"</p>

<p>5). "How to Think Like a Computer Scientist ---Learning with Python 2nd Edition"</p>

<p>6). "Python Programming"</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>If you intend to learn Python 3 instead of Python 2.x (the difference is not large), you should take a look at <a href="http://diveintopython3.org/" rel="nofollow">Dive Into Python 3</a>. It's currently being written (by Mark Pilgrim) and is around 50% complete.</p>
