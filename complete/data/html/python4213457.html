<h3>Question (ID-4213457):</h3><h2>best version control system for personal/home use when developing with eclipse and python/django</h2><p>I am working on a small django project at home. I would like to install and use a small version control system for personal use for free. I don't want to use a web service like github because I am not always connected. I would like to have the VCS server/daemon installed and use it at my home pc (windows 7). </p>

<p>I would also like it to be compatible with eclipse+pydev which I use for programming. </p>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!
Thanks,
Chris</p>

<p>I don't see any advantage in your case to use SVN instead of GIT (you can host your own GIT server, no need to use github.com)</p>

<p><em>There are also GIT alternatives for distributed SCM:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Mercurial</li>
<li>Bazaar</li>
</ul>

<p>BTW, for my personal prototype DropBox is sufficient ;)</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I suggest using mercurial with a Bitbucket private repository.  Mercurial will work just fine when you're offline, and you can push your changes to Bitbucket to access your code elsewhere (your laptop, server, etc.) later.</p>

<p>There's also mercurial plugins for eclipse. (see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1629058/mercurial-eclipse-plugin">Mercurial Eclipse Plugin</a>)</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I would recommend to use Mercurial together with DropBox in order to make sure that you don't lose everything in case of crash.</p>

<p>I hope it helps</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p><a href="http://subversion.apache.org/" rel="nofollow">SVN</a> has Eclipse plugins (<a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/" rel="nofollow">Subclipse</a>, <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/subversive/" rel="nofollow">Subversive</a>), I don't know for pydev though. But it is one of the most used version control system and it is free.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>If it is for personal use, thus you probably don't have to go with distributed vcs, I would definitely go with subversion (svn). It has nice plugin for eclipse: subversive. I'm using it for years.

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>For <a href="http://www.foldertrack.com" rel="nofollow">personal version control</a>, I would recomend the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.filehamster.com" rel="nofollow">FileHamster</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.altaro.com" rel="nofollow">Oops! Backup</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.foldertrack.com" rel="nofollow">FolderTrack</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Note: I am an author of FolderTrack. I recomend it for use with programming because it will treat a group of source files as one "work product". If you want to rewind your code to yesterday and that requires deleting 2 files, renameing 1 file, and chaning 15 more then foldertrack will do it.</p>
