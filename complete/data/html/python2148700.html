<h3>Question (ID-2148700):</h3><h2>How do I find the shortest overlapping match using regular expressions?</h2><p>I'm still relatively new to regex. I'm trying to find the shortest string of text that matches a particular pattern, but am having trouble if the shortest pattern is a substring of a larger match. For example:</p>

<pre><code>import re
string = "A|B|A|B|C|D|E|F|G"
my_pattern = 'a.*?b.*?c'

my_regex = re.compile(my_pattern, re.DOTALL|re.IGNORECASE)
matches = my_regex.findall(string)

for match in matches:
    print match
</code></pre>

<p>prints: </p>

<pre><code>A|B|A|B|C
</code></pre>

<p>but I'd want it to return:</p>

<pre><code>A|B|C
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a way to do this without having to loop over each match to see if it contains a substring that matches? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-9):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Contrary to most other answers here, this can be done in a single regex using a lookahead assertion with a capturing group:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; my_pattern = '(?=(a.*?b.*?c))'
&gt;&gt;&gt; my_regex = re.compile(my_pattern, re.DOTALL|re.IGNORECASE)
&gt;&gt;&gt; matches = my_regex.findall(string)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print min(matches, key=len)
A|B|C
</code></pre>

<p><code>findall()</code> will return all overlapping matches, so you need <code>min()</code> to get the shortest one.</p>

<p>How this works:</p>

<ul>
<li>We're not matching any text in this regex, just positions in the string (which the regex engine steps through during a match attempt). </li>
<li>At each position, the regex engine looks ahead to see whether your regex would match at this position. </li>
<li>If so, it will be captured by the capturing group. </li>
<li>If not, it won't. </li>
<li>In either case, the regex engine then steps ahead one character and repeats the process until the end of the string. </li>
<li>Since the lookahead assertion doesn't consume any characters, all overlapping matches will be found.</li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>No.  Perl returns the longest, leftmost match, while obeying your non-greedy quantifiers.  You'll have to loop, I'm afraid.</p>

<p>Edit: Yes, I realize I said Perl above, but I believe it is true for Python.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>The regex engine starts searching from the beginning of the string till it finds a match and then exits. Thus if it finds a match before it even considers the smaller one, there is no way for you to force it to consider later matches in the same run - you will have to rerun the regex on substrings.</p>

<p>Setting the global flag and choosing the shortest matched string won't help as it is evident from your example - the shorter match might be a substring of another match (or partly included in it). I believe you will have to start subsequent searches from (1 + index of previous match) and go on like that.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I do not think that this task can be accomplished by a single regular expression. I have no proof that this is the case, but there are quite a lot of things that can't be done with regexes and I expected this problem to be one of them. Some good examples of the limitations of regexes are given in <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jaredpar/archive/2008/10/15/regular-expression-limitations.aspx" rel="nofollow">this blog post</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>This might be a useful application of <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node=sexeger" rel="nofollow">sexegers</a>. Regular-expression matching is biased toward the longest, leftmost choice. Using non-greedy quantifiers such as in <code>.*?</code> skirts the longest part, and reversing both the input and pattern can get around leftmost-matching semantics.</p>

<p>Consider the following program that outputs <code>A|B|C</code> as desired:</p>

<pre><code>#! /usr/bin/env python

import re

string = "A|B|A|B|C|D|E|F|G"
my_pattern = 'c.*?b.*?a'

my_regex = re.compile(my_pattern, re.DOTALL|re.IGNORECASE)
matches = my_regex.findall(string[::-1])

for match in matches:
    print match[::-1]
</code></pre>

<p>Another way is to make a stricter pattern. Say you don't want to allow repetitions of characters already seen:</p>

<pre><code>my_pattern = 'a[^a]*?b[^ab]*?c'
</code></pre>

<p>Your example is generic and contrived, but if we had a better idea of the inputs you're working with, we could offer better, more helpful suggestions.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You might be able to write the regex in such a way that it can't contain smaller matches.</p>

<p>For your regex:</p>

<pre><code>a.*?b.*?c
</code></pre>

<p>I think you can write this:</p>

<pre><code>a[^ab]*b[^c]*c
</code></pre>

<p>It's tricky to get that correct, and I don't see any more general or more obviously correct way to do it. <em>(Edit&mdash;earlier I suggested a negative lookahead assertion, but I don't see a way to make that work.)</em></p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>A Python loop to look for the shortest match, by brute force testing each substring from left to right, picking the shortest:</p>

<pre><code>shortest = None
for i in range(len(string)):
    m = my_regex.match(string[i:])
    if m: 
        mstr = m.group()
        if shortest is None or len(mstr) &lt; len(shortest):
            shortest = mstr

print shortest
</code></pre>

<p>Another loop, this time letting re.findall do the hard work of searching for all possible matches, then brute force testing each match right-to-left looking for a shorter substring:</p>

<pre><code># find all matches using findall
matches = my_regex.findall(string)

# for each match, try to match right-hand substrings
shortest = None
for m in matches:
    for i in range(-1,-len(m),-1):
        mstr = m[i:]        
        if my_regex.match(mstr):
            break
    else:
        mstr = m

    if shortest is None or len(mstr) &lt; len(shortest):
        shortest = mstr

print shortest
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>No, there isn't in the Python regular expression engine.</p>

<p>My take for a custom function, though:</p>

<pre><code>import re, itertools

# directly from itertools recipes
def pairwise(iterable):
    "s -&gt; (s0,s1), (s1,s2), (s2, s3), ..."
    a, b = itertools.tee(iterable)
    for elem in b:
        break
    return itertools.izip(a, b)

def find_matches(rex, text):
    "Find all matches, even overlapping ones"
    matches= list(rex.finditer(text))

    # first produce typical matches
    for match in matches:
        yield match.group(0)

    # next, run it for any patterns included in matches
    for match1, match2 in pairwise(matches):
        subtext= text[match1.start()+1:match2.end()+1]
        for result in find_matches(rex, subtext):
            yield result

    # also test the last match, if there was at least one
    if matches:
        subtext= text[matches[-1].start()+1:matches[-1].end()+1]
        # perhaps the previous "matches[-1].end()+1" can be omitted
        for result in find_matches(rex, subtext):
            yield result

def shortest_match(rex, text):
    "Find the shortest match"
    return min(find_matches(rex, text), key=len)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pattern= re.compile('a.*?b.*?c', re.I)
    searched_text= "A|B|A|B|C|D|E|F|G"
    print (shortest_match(pattern, searched_text))
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>Another regex solution; it finds only the last occurence of .*a.*b.*c:</p>

<pre><code>my_pattern = 'a(?!.*a.*b.*c).*b[^c]*c'

#a(?!.*a.*?b.*?c) - ensures that there is no 'a.*?b.*?c' after first 'A'
#strings like A|A|B|C or A|B|A|B|C or A|B|C|A|B|C in results are eliminated
#
#b[^c]*c - ensures that after 'B' there is only one 'C'
#strings like A|B|C|B|C or A|B|C|C in results are eliminated
#
#so you have the smallest matching 'a.*?b.*?c'
</code></pre>
