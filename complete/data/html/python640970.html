<h3>Question (ID-640970):</h3><h2>Email integration</h2><p>I was wondering if someone could help me out.  In some web application, the app will send out emails, say when a new message has been posted.  Then instead of signing into the application to post a reply you can just simply reply to the email and it will automatically update the web app with your response.</p>

<p>My question is, how is this done and what is it called?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>1) Set up a dedicated email account for the purpose.</p>

<p>2) Have a programm monitor the mailbox (let's say fetchmail, since that's what I do).</p>

<p>3) When an email arrives at the account, fetchmail downloads the email, writes it to disk, and calls script or program you have written with the email file as an argument.</p>

<p>4) Your script or program parses the email and takes an appropriate action.</p>

<p>The part that's usually mysterious to people is the fetchmail part (#2).</p>

<p><strong>Specifically on Mail Servers</strong> <em>(iff you control the mailserver enough to redirect emails to scripts)</em>:</p>

<p>1-3) Configure an address to be piped to a script you have written.</p>

<p>4) Same as above.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>From your tags, I'll assume you're wanting to do this in Django.</p>

<p>There's an app out there called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jutda-helpdesk/" rel="nofollow">jutda-helpdesk</a> that does exactly what you're looking for using poplib, which means you just have to set up a POP3 compatible email address.</p>

<p>Take a look at their <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jutda-helpdesk/source/browse/trunk/management/commands/get%5Femail.py" rel="nofollow">get_email.py</a> to see how they do it.  You just run this script from cron.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You should take a look at <a href="http://lamsonproject.org" rel="nofollow">Lamson</a>; it'll enable you do what you've described, and more besides.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>A common tool used for this purpose is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procmail" rel="nofollow">procmail</a>.</p>

<p>You need to set up dedicated email address (which is the "from_email" address in your outgoing email). Then your MTA, such as postfix or qmail, will deliver mail to that address to procmail instead of an actual mailbox.</p>

<p>Procmail can then pass the email on to your python script that can do updates in the app.  See <a href="http://www.b-list.org/weblog/2007/sep/22/standalone-django-scripts/" rel="nofollow">standalone django scripts</a> by James Bennett on how to code python scripts that can work with your app.</p>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>This is an area where the Rails-world is ahead: <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action%5Fmailer%5Fbasics.html#receiving-emails" rel="nofollow">Rails has built-in support for receiving emails</a>. The mail sever configuration though is probably just the same.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Check <a href="http://pushreply.com" rel="nofollow">http://pushreply.com</a>, a service designed exactly for this use case. It collects reply messages, extracts the relevant content and notifies your application using a HTTP POST request. </p>
