<h3>Question (ID-414679):</h3><h2>Add class to Django label_tag() output</h2><p>I need some way to add a class attribute to the output of the label_tag() method for a forms field. </p>

<p>I see that there is the ability to pass in an attrs dictionary and I have tested it in the shell and I can do something like:</p>

<pre><code>for field in form:
    print field.label_tag(attrs{'class':'Foo'})
</code></pre>

<p>I will see the class='Foo' in my output, but I don't see a way to add an attrs argument from the template - in fact, templates are designed specifically against that, no?</p>

<p>Is there a way in my form definition to define the class to be displayed in the label?</p>

<p>In the form, I can do the following to give the inputs a class</p>

<pre><code>self.fields['some_field'].widget.attrs['class'] = 'Foo'
</code></pre>

<p>I just need to have it output the class for the  as well.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>A <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/custom-template-tags/#howto-custom-template-tags" rel="nofollow">custom template tag</a> seems to be the solution. A custom filter would also do, although it can be less elegant. But you would need to fall back to custom form rendering in both cases.</p>

<p>If this is a task of high importance; I'd create a Mixin that allows me to annotate the form fields with label classes and supplies form rendering methods using those classes. So that the following code works:</p>

<pre><code>{{ form.as_table_with_label_classes }}
</code></pre>

<p>But I'd like to ask; Do you really need a class on the label tag? I mean HTML design-wise. It is absolutely necessary to <em>add</em> a class in there? Couldn't it be solved with some CSS like:</p>

<pre><code>encapsulating_selector label {
    some-attr: some-value;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I sometimes use <a href="http://jquery.com" rel="nofollow">jQuery</a> for such cases where; <em>it will improve the page if it works, but it won't be a disaster if it doesn't</em>. And keep the HTML source as lean as possible.</p>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I am aggre with answer number one, with css this could be done, but.
Why is the reson for this in django source.</p>

<p>class BoundField(StrAndUnicode): in django.forms.forms.py that has the definition of
def label_tag(self, contents=None, attrs=None):
had been prepare to display this attrs in
contents = u'%s' % (widget.id_for_label(id_), attrs, unicode(contents))</p>

<p>but def _html_output call this function without attrs in 
label = bf.label_tag(label) or ''</p>

<p>So I seed that django are partially prepare to this but actually it does not used that.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>How about adding the CSS class to the form field in the forms.py, like:</p>

<pre><code>class MyForm(forms.Form):
    title = forms.CharField(widget=forms.TextInput(attrs={'class': 'foo'}))
</code></pre>

<p>then I just do the following in the template:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;label for="id_{{form.title.name}}" class="bar"&gt;
    {{ form.title }}
&lt;/label&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Of course this can easily be modified to work within a for loop tag in the template.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><pre><code>@register.simple_tag
def advanced_label_tag(field):
    """ Return form field label html marked to fill by `*` """
    classes = []
    attrs = {}
    contents = force_unicode(escape(field.label))

    if field.field.required:
        classes.append(u'required')
        contents = force_unicode('%s &lt;span&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;'%escape(field.label))

    if classes:
        attrs['class'] = u' '.join(classes)

    return field.label_tag(contents=contents, attrs=attrs)
</code></pre>
