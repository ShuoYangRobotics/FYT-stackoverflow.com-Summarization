<h3>Question (ID-1080026):</h3><h2>Is there a map without result in python?</h2><p>Sometimes, I just want to execute a function for a list of entries -- eg.:</p>

<pre><code>for x in wowList:
   installWow(x, 'installed by me')
</code></pre>

<p>Sometimes I need this stuff for module initialization, so I don't want to have a footprint like x in global namespace. One solution would be to just use map together with lambda:</p>

<pre><code>map(lambda x: installWow(x, 'installed by me'), wowList)
</code></pre>

<p>But this of course creates a nice list [None, None, ...] so my question is, if there is a similar function without a return-list -- since I just don't need it.</p>

<p>(off course I can also use _x and thus not leaving visible footprint -- but the map-solution looks so neat ...)</p>

<pre><code>for x in wowList:
    installWow(x, 'installed by me')
del x
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You could make your own "each" function:</p>

<pre>
<code>
def each(fn, items):
    for item in items:
        fn(item)


# called thus
each(lambda x: installWow(x, 'installed by me'), wowList)
</code>
</pre>

<p>Basically it's just map, but without the results being returned.  By using a function you'll ensure that the "item" variable doesn't leak into the current scope.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You might try this:</p>

<pre><code>filter(lambda x: installWow(x, 'installed by me') and False, wowList)
</code></pre>

<p>That way, the return result is an empty list no matter what.</p>

<p>Or you could just drop the <code>and False</code> if you can force <code>installWow()</code> to always return <code>False</code> (or 0 or <code>None</code> or another expression that evaluates false).</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Every expression evaluates to something, so you always get a result, whichever way you do it. And any such returned object (just like your list) will get thrown away afterwards because there's no reference to it anymore.</p>

<p>To clarify: Very few things in python are statements that don't return anything. Even a function call like</p>

<pre><code>doSomething()
</code></pre>

<p>still returns a value, even if it gets discarded right away. There is no such thing as Pascal's function / procedure distinction in python.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>if it is ok to distruct wowList</p>

<pre><code>while wowList: installWow(wowList.pop(), 'installed by me')
</code></pre>

<p>if you do want to maintain wowList</p>

<pre><code>wowListR = wowList[:]
while wowListR: installWow(wowListR.pop(), 'installed by me')
</code></pre>

<p>and if order matters</p>

<pre><code>wowListR = wowList[:]; wowListR.reverse()
while wowListR: installWow(wowListR.pop(), 'installed by me')
</code></pre>

<p>Though as the solution of the puzzle I like the first :)</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I can not resist myself to post it as separate answer</p>

<pre><code>reduce(lambda x,y: x(y, 'installed by me') , wowList, installWow)
</code></pre>

<p>only twist is installWow should return itself e.g.</p>

<pre><code>def installWow(*args):
    print args
    return installWow
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>You could use a filter and a function that doesn't return a True value. You'd get an empty return list since filter only adds the values which evaluates to true, which I suppose would save you some memory. Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
y = 0
def myfunction(x):
  global y
  y += x

input = (1, 2, 3, 4)

print "Filter output: %s" % repr(filter(myfunction, input))
print "Side effect result: %d" % y
</code></pre>

<p>Running it produces this output:</p>

<pre><code>Filter output: ()
Side effect result: 10
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>first rewrite the for loop as a generator expression, which does not allocate any memory.  </p>

<pre><code>(installWow(x,  'installed by me') for x in wowList )
</code></pre>

<p>But this expression doesn't actually do anything without finding some way to consume it.  So we can rewrite this to yield something determinate, rather than rely on the possibly <code>None</code> result of <code>installWow</code>.  </p>

<pre><code>( [1, installWow(x,  'installed by me')][0] for x in wowList )
</code></pre>

<p>which creates a list, but returns only the constant 1.  this can be consumed conveniently with <code>reduce</code></p>

<pre><code>reduce(sum, ( [1, installWow(x,  'installed by me')][0] for x in wowList ))
</code></pre>

<p>Which conveniently returns the number of items in wowList that were affected.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>Just make installWow return None or make the last statement be pass like so:</p>

<pre><code>
def installWow(item, phrase='installed by me'):
  print phrase
  pass
</code></pre>

<p>and use this:</p>

<pre><code>
list(x for x in wowList if installWow(x))
</code></pre>

<p>x won't be set in the global name space and the list returned is [] a singleton</p>
