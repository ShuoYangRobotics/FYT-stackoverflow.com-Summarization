<h3>Question (ID-2174015):</h3><h2>recursive nested expression in Python</h2><p>I am using Python 2.6.4.</p>

<p>I have a series of select statements in a text file and I need to extract the field names from each select query. This would be easy if some of the fields didn't use nested functions  like to_char() etc. </p>

<p>Given select statement fields that could have several nested parenthese like "ltrim(rtrim(to_char(base_field_name, format))) renamed_field_name," or the simple case of just "base_field_name" as a field, is it possible to use Python's re module to write a regex to extract base_field_name? If so, what would the regex look like? </p>

Try, instead, a full-fledged parsing kit such as <a href="http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/" rel="nofollow">pyparsing</a> -- examples of using pyparsing specifically to parse SQL can be found <a href="http://michelhollands.net/blog/2007/10/24/using-pyparsing/" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://michelhollands.net/blog/2007/11/02/using-pyparsing-2/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, for example (you'll no doubt need to take the examples just as a starting point, and write some parsing code of your own, but, it's definitely not too difficult).</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Either a table-driven parser as Alex Martelli suggests or a hand-written recursive descent parser.  They're not hard and quite rewarding to write.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import re
&gt;&gt;&gt; string = 'ltrim(rtrim(to_char(base_field_name, format))) renamed_field_name'
&gt;&gt;&gt; rx = re.compile('^(.*?\()*(.+?)(,.*?)*(,|\).*?)*$')
&gt;&gt;&gt; rx.search(string).group(2)
'base_field_name'
&gt;&gt;&gt; rx.search('base_field_name').group(2)
'base_field_name'
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>This may be good enough:</p>

<pre><code>import re
print re.match(r".*\(([^\)]+)\)", "ltrim(to_char(field_name, format)))").group(1)
</code></pre>

<p>You would need to do further processing. For example pick up the function name as well and pull the field name according to function signature.</p>

<pre><code>.*(\w+)\(([^\)]+)\)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Here's a really hacky parser that does what you want.</p>

<p>It works by calling 'eval' on the text to be parsed, mapping all identifiers to a function which returns its first argument (which I'm guessing is what you want given your example). </p>

<pre><code>class FakeFunction(object):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def __call__(self, *args):
        return args[0]
    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

class FakeGlobals(dict):
    def __getitem__(self, x):
        return FakeFunction(x)

def ExtractBaseFieldName(x):
    return eval(x, FakeGlobals())

print ExtractBaseFieldName('ltrim(rtrim(to_char(base_field_name, format)))')
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Do you really need regular expressions? To get the one you've got up there I'd use</p>

<pre><code>  s[s.rfind('(')+1:s.find(')')].split(',')[0]
</code></pre>

<p>with 's' containing the original string.</p>

<p>Of course, it's not a general solution, but...</p>
