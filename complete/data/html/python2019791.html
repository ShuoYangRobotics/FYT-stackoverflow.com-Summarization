<h3>Question (ID-2019791):</h3><h2>python list that matches everything</h2><p>I probably didn't ask correctly: I would like a list value that can match any list: the "inverse" of <code>(None,)</code>
but even with <code>(None,)</code> it will match item as None (which I don't want)</p>

<p>The point is I have a function working with: <code>[x for x in my_list if x[field] not in filter_list]</code></p>

<p>and I would like to filter everything or nothing without making tests like:
<code>if filter_list==(None,): return []</code> and <code>if filter_list==('*',): return my_list</code></p>

<p>PS: I wanted to simplify my question leading to some errors (<code>list</code> identifier) or stupid thing <code>[x for x in x]</code> ;)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I need to do some filtering with list comprehension in python.</p>

<p>if I do something like that:</p>

<pre><code>[x for x in list if x in (None,)]
</code></pre>

<p>I get rid of all values, which is fine</p>

<p>but I would like to have the same thing to match everything</p>

<p>I can do something like:</p>

<pre><code>[x for x in list if x not in (None,)]
</code></pre>

<p>but it won't be homogeneous with the rest</p>

<p>I tried some things but for example <code>(True,)</code> matches only  <code>1</code></p>

<p>Note than the values to filter are numeric, but if you have something generic (like <code>(None,)</code> to match nothing), it would be great</p>

<p>Thanks
Louis</p>

<pre><code>class everything(object):
    def __contains__(self, _):
        return True           

for x in (1,2,3):
    print x in everything()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The better syntax would be:</p>

<pre><code>[x for x in lst if x is None]
[x for x in lst if x is not None]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>What do you mean by</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Just do</p>

<pre><code>[x for x in list]
</code></pre>

<p>and every item in <code>list</code> is matched.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You could change your program to accept a filter object, instead of a list. </p>

<p>The abstract base filter would have a <code>matches</code> method, that returns true if x *matches".</p>

<p>Your general case filters would be constructed with a list argument, and would filter on membership of the list - the <code>matches</code> function would search the list and return <code>true</code> if the argument was in the list.</p>

<p>You could also have two special subclasses of the filter object : none and all.</p>

<p>These would have special match functions which either always return <code>true</code> (all) or <code>false</code> (none).</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You don't need an <code>if</code>, you can just say</p>

<pre><code>[x for x in list]
</code></pre>

<p>To match everything, you don't need if statement</p>

<pre><code>[x for x in list1]
</code></pre>

<p>or If you really like to do</p>

<pre><code>[x for x in list1 if x in [x]]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Answering your revised question: the list that "matches" all possible values is effectively of infinite length. So you can't do what you want to do without an if test. I suggest that your arg should be either a list or one of two values representing the "all" and "none" cases:</p>

<pre><code>FILTER_NONE = object() # or []
FILTER_ALL = object()

def filter_func(alist, filter_list):
    if filter_list is FILTER_ALL:
        return []
    elif filter_list is FILTER_NONE:
        return alist
        # or maybe alist[:] # copy the list
    return [x for x in alist if x not in filter_list]
</code></pre>

<p>If filter_list is large, you may wish the replace the last line by:</p>

<pre><code>    filter_set = set(filter_list)
    return [x for x in alist if x not in filter_set]
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, don't bother; just document that filter_list (renamed as filter_collection) can be anything that supports  <code>__contains__()</code> and remind readers that sets will be faster than lists.</p>
