<h3>Question (ID-4246000):</h3><h2>Python: calling functions dynamically</h2><p>Suppose:</p>

<pre><code>fields = ['name','email']

def clean_name():
    pass

def clean_email():
    pass
</code></pre>

<p>How can I call clean_name() and clean_email() dynamically?
For example:</p>

<pre><code>for field in fields:
    clean_{field}()
</code></pre>

<p>I used the curly brackets because it's how I used to do it in PHP but obviously doesn't work.</p>

<p>How to do this with python?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Global is a very very bad way of doing this. You should be doing it this way.</p>

<pre><code>fields = {'name':clean_name,'email':clean_email}

for key in fields:
    fields[key]()
</code></pre>

<p>Edit2: Map your functions to values in a dictionary </p>

<p>Edit: Also using vars()[] is wrong too.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>It would be better to have dictionary of such functions than to look in globals(). Usual approach is to write a class with such functions:</p>

<pre><code>class Cleaner(object):
    def clean_name(self):
        pass
</code></pre>

<p>and then use getattr to get access to them:</p>

<pre><code>cleaner = Cleaner()
for f in fields:
    getattr(cleaner, 'clean_%s' % f)()
</code></pre>

<p>You could even move further and do something like that:</p>

<pre><code>class Cleaner(object):
    def __init__(self, fields):
        self.fields = fields

    def clean(self):
        for f in self.fields:
            getattr(self, 'clean_%s' % f)()
</code></pre>

<p>Then just inherit it and declare your <code>clean_&lt;name&gt;</code> methods on an inherited class and use like that:</p>

<pre><code>cleaner = Cleaner(['one', 'two'])
cleaner.clean()
</code></pre>

<p>Actually this can be extended even further to make it more clean (first step probably will be adding check with <code>hasattr()</code> if such method exists on your class), that's just a start.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>And, finally, if don't want to use <code>globals, vars</code> and don't want make a separate module and/or class to encapsulate functions you want to call dynamically, you can call them as the attributes of the current module:</p>

<pre><code>import sys
...
getattr(sys.modules[__name__], "clean_%s" % fieldname)()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p><code>globals()</code> will give you a <code>dict</code> of the global namespace. From this you can get the function you want:</p>

<pre><code>f = globals()["clean_%s" % field]
</code></pre>

<p>Then call it:</p>

<pre><code>f()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><pre><code>for field in fields:
    vars()['clean_' + field]()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Another one way:</p>

<p>myscript.py</p>

<pre><code>def f1():
    print 'f1'

def f2():
    print 'f2'

def f3():
    print 'f3'
</code></pre>

<p>test.py</p>

<pre><code>import myscript

for i in range(1, 4):
    getattr(myscript, 'f%d' % i)()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I would use a dictionary which mapped field names to cleaning functions. If some fields don't have corresponding cleaning function, the <code>for</code> loop handling them can be kept simple by providing some sort of default function for those cases. Here's what I mean:</p>

<pre><code>fields = ['name', 'email', 'subject']

def clean_name():
    pass
def clean_email():
    pass

# (one-time) field to cleaning-function map construction
def get_clean_func(field):
    try:
        return eval('clean_'+field)
    except NameError:
        return lambda: None  # do nothing
clean = dict((field, get_clean_func(field)) for field in fields)

# sample usage
for field in fields:
    clean[field]()
</code></pre>

<p>The code above constructs the function dictionary dynamically by determining if a corresponding function named <code>clean_&lt;field&gt;</code> exists for each one named in the <code>fields</code> list. You likely would only have to execute it once since it would remain the same as long as the field list or available cleaning functions aren't changed.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Here's another way: define the functions then define a dict with the names as keys:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; z=[clean_email, clean_name]
&gt;&gt;&gt; z={"email": clean_email, "name":clean_name}
&gt;&gt;&gt; z['email']()
&gt;&gt;&gt; z['name']()
</code></pre>

<p>then you loop over the names as keys.</p>

<p>or how about this one? Construct a string and use 'eval':</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; field = "email"
&gt;&gt;&gt; f="clean_"+field+"()"
&gt;&gt;&gt; eval(f)
</code></pre>

<p>then just loop and construct the strings for eval.</p>

<p>Note that any method that requires constructing a string for evaluation is regarded as kludgy.</p>
