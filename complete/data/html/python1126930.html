<h3>Question (ID-1126930):</h3><h2>Is it possible to go into ipython from code?</h2><p>For my debugging needs,<strong>pdb</strong> is pretty good. However, it would be <strong>MUCH</strong> cooler ( and helpful ) if I could go into ipython. Is this thing possible?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>There is an <code>ipdb</code> project which embeds iPython into the standard pdb, so you can just do:</p>

<pre><code>import ipdb; ipdb.set_trace()
</code></pre>

<p>It's installable via the usual <code>easy_install ipdb</code>.</p>

<p><code>ipdb</code> is pretty short, so instead of easy_installing you can also create a file <code>ipdb.py</code> somewhere on your Python path and paste the following into the file:</p>

<pre><code>import sys
from IPython.Debugger import Pdb
from IPython.Shell import IPShell
from IPython import ipapi

shell = IPShell(argv=[''])

def set_trace():
    ip = ipapi.get()
    def_colors = ip.options.colors
    Pdb(def_colors).set_trace(sys._getframe().f_back)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Normally, when I use ipython, I turn automatic debugging on with the "pdb" command inside it.</p>

<p>I then run my script with the "run myscript.py" command in the directory where my script is located.</p>

<p>If I get an exception, ipython stops the program inside the debugger.  Check out the help command for the magic ipython commands (%magic)</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>The equivalent of </p>

<pre><code>import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
</code></pre>

<p>with IPython is something like:</p>

<pre><code>from IPython.ipapi import make_session; make_session()
from IPython.Debugger import Pdb; Pdb().set_trace()
</code></pre>

<p>It's a bit verbose, but good to know if you don't have ipdb installed.  The <code>make_session</code> call is required once to set up the color scheme, etc, and <code>set_trace</code> calls can be placed anywhere you need to break.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>From the <a href="http://ipython.scipy.org/doc/stable/html/interactive/extension%5Fapi.html#launching-ipython-instance-from-normal-python-code" rel="nofollow">IPython docs</a>:</p>

<pre><code>import IPython.ipapi
namespace = dict(
    kissa = 15,
    koira = 16)
IPython.ipapi.launch_new_instance(namespace)
</code></pre>

<p>will launch an IPython shell programmatically.  Obviously the values in the <code>namespace</code> dict are just dummy values - it might make more sense to use <code>locals()</code> in practice.</p>

<p>Note that you have to hard-code this in; it's not going to work the way <code>pdb</code> does. If that's what you want, DoxaLogos' answer is probably more like what you're looking for.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>In IPython 0.11, you can embed IPython directly in your code like this</p>

<p>Your program might look like this</p>

<pre><code>In [5]: cat &gt; tmpf.py
a = 1

from IPython import embed
embed() # drop into an IPython session.
        # Any variables you define or modify here
        # will not affect program execution

c = 2

^D
</code></pre>

<p>This is what happens when you run it (I arbitrarily chose to run it inside an existing ipython session.  Nesting ipython sessions like this in my experience can cause it to  crash).</p>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>The fast-and-easy way:</p>

<pre><code>from IPython.Debugger import Tracer
debug = Tracer()
</code></pre>

<p>Then just write</p>

<pre><code>debug()
</code></pre>

<p>wherever you want to start debugging your program.</p>
