<h3>Question (ID-1047318):</h3><h2>Easiest way to persist a data structure to a file in python?</h2><p>Let's say I have something like this:</p>

<pre><code>d = { "abc" : [1, 2, 3], "qwerty" : [4,5,6] }
</code></pre>

<p>What's the easiest way to  <strong>progammatically</strong> get that into a file that I can load from python later?</p>

<p>Can I somehow save it as python source (from within a python script, not manually!), then <code>import</code> it later?</p>

<p>Or should I use JSON or something?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/pickle.html" rel="nofollow">pickle</a> module.</p>

<pre><code>import pickle
d = { "abc" : [1, 2, 3], "qwerty" : [4,5,6] }
afile = open(r'C:\d.pkl', 'wb')
pickle.dump(d, afile)
afile.close()

#reload object from file
file2 = open(r'C:\d.pkl', 'rb')
new_d = pickle.load(file2)
file2.close()

#print dictionary object loaded from file
print new_d
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Take your pick: <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/persistence.html" rel="nofollow">Python Standard Library - Data Persistance</a>.  Which one is most appropriate can vary by what your specific needs are.</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.python.org/library/pickle.html" rel="nofollow"><code>pickle</code></a> is probably the simplest and most capable as far as "write an arbitrary object to a file and recover it" goesâ€”it can automatically handle custom classes and circular references.</p>

<p>For the best pickling performance (speed and space), use <code>cPickle</code> at <code>HIGHEST_PROTOCOL</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Try the shelve module which will give you persistent dictionary, for example:</p>

<pre><code>import shelve
d = { "abc" : [1, 2, 3], "qwerty" : [4,5,6] }

shelf = shelve.open('shelf_file')
for key,val in d.items():
    shelf[key] = val

shelf.close()

....

# reopen the shelf
shelf = shelve.open('shelf_file')
print shelf # =&gt; {'qwerty': [4, 5, 6], 'abc': [1, 2, 3]}
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You also might want to take a look at <a href="http://wiki.zope.org/ZODB/FrontPage" rel="nofollow">Zope's Object Database</a> the more complex you get:-)  Probably overkill for what you have, but it scales well and is not too hard to use.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>If you want to save it in an easy to read JSON-like format, use <code>repr</code> to serialize the object and <code>eval</code> to deserialize it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>repr(object) -&gt; string</code>  </p>
  
  <p>Return the canonical string representation of the object.
  For most object types, <code>eval(repr(object)) == object</code>.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Just to add to the previous suggestions, if you want the file format to be easily readable and modifiable, you can also use <a href="http://pyyaml.org/" rel="nofollow">YAML</a>. It works extremely well for nested dicts and lists, but scales for more complex data structures (i.e. ones involving custom objects) as well, and its big plus is that the format is readable.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p><a href="http://json.org/" rel="nofollow">JSON</a> has faults, but when it meets your needs, it is also:</p>

<ul>
<li>simple to use</li>
<li>included in the standard library as the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/json.html" rel="nofollow"><code>json</code> module</a></li>
<li>interface somewhat similar to <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/pickle.html" rel="nofollow"><code>pickle</code></a>, which can handle more complex situations</li>
<li>human-editable text for debugging, sharing, and version control</li>
<li>valid Python code</li>
<li>well-established on the web (if your program touches any of that domain)</li>
</ul>
