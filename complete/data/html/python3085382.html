<h3>Question (ID-3085382):</h3><h2>python How can I strip first and last double quotes</h2><p>I want to strip double quotes from</p>

<pre><code>string = '"" " " ""\\1" " "" ""'
</code></pre>

<p>to become</p>

<pre><code>string = '" " " ""\\1" " "" "'
</code></pre>

<p>I tried to use rstrip, lstrip and strip('[^\"]|[\"$]') but it did not work.</p>

<p>How can I do this?
Thank you for helping me.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>If the quotes you want to strip are always going to be "first and last" as you said, then you could simply use:</p>

<p><code>string = string[1:-1]</code></p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>If you can't assume that all the strings you process have double quotes you can use something like this:</p>

<pre><code>if string.startswith('"') and string.endswith('"'):
    string = string[1:-1]
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>I'm sure that you just used <code>string</code> as the variable name for exemplification here and in your real code it has a useful name, but I feel obliged to warn you that there is a module named <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/string.html" rel="nofollow"><code>string</code></a> in the standard libraries.  It's not loaded automatically, but if you ever use <code>import string</code> make sure your variable doesn't eclipse it.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If string is always as you show:</p>

<pre><code>string[1:-1]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>If you are sure there is a " at the beginning and at the end, which you want to remove, just do:</p>

<pre><code>string = string[1:len(string)-1]
</code></pre>

<p>or </p>

<pre><code>string = string[1:-1]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>To remove the first and last characters, and in each case do the removal only if the character in question is a double quote:</p>

<pre><code>import re

s = re.sub(r'^"|"$', '', s)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the RE pattern is different than the one you had given, and the operation is <code>sub</code> ("substitute") with an empty replacement string (<code>strip</code> is a string method but does something pretty different from your requirements, as other answers have indicated).</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>find the position of the first and the last " in your string</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s = '"" " " ""\\1" " "" ""'
&gt;&gt;&gt; l = s.find('"')
&gt;&gt;&gt; r = s.rfind('"')

&gt;&gt;&gt; s[l+1:r]
'" " " ""\\1" " "" "'
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Almost done. Quoting from <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=strip#str.strip" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=strip#str.strip</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The chars argument is a string
  specifying the set of characters to be
  removed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[...]</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The chars argument is not a prefix or
  suffix; rather, all combinations of
  its values are stripped:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the argument is not a regexp.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; string = '"" " " ""\\1" " "" ""'
&gt;&gt;&gt; string.strip('"')
' " " ""\\1" " "" '
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note, that this is not exactly what you requested, because it eats multiple quotes from both end of the string!</strong></p>
