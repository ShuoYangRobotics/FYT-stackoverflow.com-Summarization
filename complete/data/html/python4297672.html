<h3>Question (ID-4297672):</h3><h2>Full text search engine for Python</h2><p>I'm searching for a Python full text search engine.</p>

<p>I took a look at PyLucense, but I think that using a Java-based library in a Python project is not good. As I understand, Sphinx does not have a Python API.</p>

<p>Any ideas ?</p>

<p>is not true. Download the release and look at <code>sphinx/api/sphinxapi.py</code></p>

<p>I use it myself and I'm pretty happy with it. The documentation is for PHP only but the Python API uses the exact same names for all functions.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I will recommend whoosh. You can easy install it ie easy_install Whoosh
It has a neat API too</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p><a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/" rel="nofollow">Apache Solr</a> is Lucene-based and offers a REST/HTTP interface to its search functions, so you have no platform lock-in or language issues. IMO it is by far the best search server out there with more features than you can ever wish for and active community to support it.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Have you tried sqlite's <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/fts3.html" rel="nofollow">FTS</a> features? You used the sqlite tag but I see no mention of sqlite in your question.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Particularly for full text search, Solr is an excellent choice.  You will have a hard time finding a more widely used and more open choice.  We use Solr/Lucene at my company with a PHP web application being the client and the HTTP/REST API to let you query the index.  It has as much functionality as a native PHP client would have and much more flexibility out of the box.  You can perform any query/filter you choose all using the REST API.  But, on top of all of that, you get an extremely performant and widely used search system with built-in replication that is constantly being improved.  Strongly recommend Solr 1.4.x as your starting point.</p>
