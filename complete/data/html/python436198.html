<h3>Question (ID-436198):</h3><h2>What is an alternative to execfile in Python 3.0?</h2><p>It seems they canceled in Python 3.0 all the easy way to quickly load a script file - both execfile() and reload(). </p>

<p>Is there an obvious alternative I'm missing?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You are just supposed to read the file and exec the code yourself. 2to3 current replaces</p>

<pre><code>execfile("somefile.py", local_vars, global_vars)
</code></pre>

<p>as</p>

<pre><code>exec(compile(open("somefile.py").read(), "somefile.py", 'exec'), global_vars, local_vars)
</code></pre>

<p>(The compile call isn't strictly needed, but it associates the filename with the code object making debugging a little easier.)</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>If the script you want to load is in the same directory than the one you run, maybe "import" will do the job ?</p>

<p>If you need to dynamically import code the built-in function <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#__import__" rel="nofollow">__ import__</a> and the module <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/imp.html" rel="nofollow">imp</a> are worth looking at.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import sys
&gt;&gt;&gt; sys.path = ['/path/to/script'] + sys.path
&gt;&gt;&gt; __import__('test')
&lt;module 'test' from '/path/to/script/test.pyc'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; __import__('test').run()
'Hello world!'
</code></pre>

<p>test.py:</p>

<pre><code>def run():
        return "Hello world!"
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using Python 3.1 or later, you should also take a look at <a href="http://docs.python.org/release/3.1/library/importlib.html" rel="nofollow">importlib</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><pre><code>def execfile(file, globals=globals(), locals=locals()):
    with open(file, "r") as fh:
        exec(fh.read()+"\n", globals, locals)
</code></pre>

<p>If you really needed to...</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>This one is better, since it takes the globals and locals from the caller:</p>

<pre><code>import sys
def execfile(filename, globals=None, locals=None):
    if globals is None:
        globals = sys._getframe(1).f_globals
    if locals is None:
        locals = sys._getframe(1).f_locals
    with open(filename, "r") as fh:
        exec(fh.read()+"\n", globals, locals)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Note that the above pattern will fail if you're using PEP-263 encoding declarations
that aren't ascii or utf-8. You need to find the encoding of the data, and encode it 
correctly before handing it to exec().</p>

<pre><code>class python3Execfile(object):
    def _get_file_encoding(self, filename):
        with open(filename, 'rb') as fp:
            try:
                return tokenize.detect_encoding(fp.readline)[0]
            except SyntaxError:
                return "utf-8"

    def my_execfile(filename):
        globals['__file__'] = filename
        with open(filename, 'r', encoding=self._get_file_encoding(filename)) as fp:
            contents = fp.read()
        if not contents.endswith("\n"):
            # http://bugs.python.org/issue10204
            contents += "\n"
        exec(contents, globals, globals)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>If you have to use <code>execfile</code>, you have a design problem.
Of course you can always read the entire file as a string and use the <code>exec</code> statement on it. But it would be even better to rethink your application's design so you won't need it in first place.</p>
