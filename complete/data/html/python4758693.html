<h3>Question (ID-4758693):</h3><h2>I want to use NumPy/SciPy. Should I use Python 2 or 3?</h2><p>I am about to embark on some signal processing work using NumPy/SciPy. However, I have never used Python before and don't know where to start.</p>

<p>I see there are currently two branches of Python in this world: Version 2.x and 3.x.<br>
Being a neophile, I instinctively tend to go for the newer one, but there seems to be a lot of talk about incompatibilities between the two. Numpy seems to be compatible with Python 3. I can't find any documents on SciPy.</p>

<p>Would you recommend to go with Python 3 or 2?</p>

<p>(could you point me to some resources to get started? I know C/C++, Ruby, Matlab and some other stuff and basically want to use NumPy instead of Matlab.)</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I am using Python 2.6 with Numpy. I can confirm that Python 3 is not backward compatible. So I myself am not very confident with upgrading. Have a look at the cookbook to get started</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Both scipy and numpy are compatible with py3k. However, if you'll need to plot stuff: matplotlib is not yet officially compatible with py3k. So, it'll depend on whether your signalling processing involves plotting.</p>

<p>Syntactic differences are not that great between the two version.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I personally suggest you begin with 2.7, 'cause it seems to me that there is a lot of time before 2.x will become deprecated.

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I am quite conservative in this respect, and so I use Python 2.6. That's what comes pre-installed on my Linux box, and it is also the target version for the latest binary releases of SciPy.</p>

<p>Python 3 is without a doubt a huge step forward, but if you do mainly numerical stuff with NumPy and SciPy, I'd still go for Python 2.</p>

<p>Scipy for python 3.2 available in beta: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/scipy/files/scipy/0.10.0b2/" rel="nofollow">http://sourceforge.net/projects/scipy/files/scipy/0.10.0b2/</a></p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I can recommend Using py3k over py2.6 if possible. Especially if you're a new user, since some of the syntax changes in py3k and it'll be harder to get used the new syntax if you're starting out learning the old.</p>

<p>The modules you mention all have support for py3k but as SilentGhost noted you might want to check for compatibility with plotting libraries too.</p>
