<h3>Question (ID-1703640):</h3><h2>How to implement a pythonic equivalent of tail -F?</h2><p>What is the pythonic way of watching the tail end of a growing file for the occurrence of certain keywords?</p>

<p>In shell I might say:</p>

<pre><code>tail -f "$file" | grep "$string" | while read hit; do
    #stuff
done
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You can use select to poll for new contents in a file.</p>

<pre><code>def tail(filename, bufsize = 1024):
    fds = [ os.open(filename, os.O_RDONLY) ]
    while True:
        reads, _, _ = select.select(fds, [], [])
        if 0 &lt; len(reads):
            yield os.read(reads[0], bufsize)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Well, the simplest way would be to constantly read from the file, check what's new and test for hits.</p>

<pre><code>import time

def watch(fn, words):
    fp = open(fn, 'r')
    while True:
        new = fp.readline()
        # Once all lines are read this just returns ''
        # until the file changes and a new line appears

        if new:
            for word in words:
                if word in new:
                    yield (word, new)
        else:
            time.sleep(0.5)

fn = 'test.py'
words = ['word']
for hit_word, hit_sentence in watch(fn, words):
    print "Found %r in line: %r" % (hit_word, hit_sentence)
</code></pre>

<p>This solution with <code>readline</code> works if you know your data will appear in lines. </p>

<p>If the data is some sort of stream you need a buffer, larger than the largest <code>word</code> you're looking for, and fill it first. It gets a bit more complicated that way...</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If you can't constraint the problem to work for a line-based read, you need to resort to blocks.</p>

<p>This should work:</p>

<pre><code>import sys

needle = "needle"

blocks = []

inf = sys.stdin

if len(sys.argv) == 2:
    inf = open(sys.argv[1])

while True:
    block = inf.read()
    blocks.append(block)
    if len(blocks) &gt;= 2:
        data = "".join((blocks[-2], blocks[-1]))
    else:
        data = blocks[-1]

    # attention, this needs to be changed if you are interested
    # in *all* matches separately, not if there was any match ata all
    if needle in data:
        print "found"
        blocks = []
    blocks[:-2] = []

    if block == "":
        break
</code></pre>

<p>The challenge lies in ensuring that you match needle even if it's separated by two block-boundaries.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Either open the file with <code>O_NONBLOCK</code> and use <code>select</code> to poll for read availability and then <code>read</code> to read the new data and the string methods to filter lines on the end of a file...or just use the <code>subprocess</code> module and let <code>tail</code> and <code>grep</code> do the work for you just as you would in the shell.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You can use <code>collections.deque</code> to implement tail.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/collections.html#deque-recipes" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/library/collections.html#deque-recipes</a> ...</p>

<pre><code>def tail(filename, n=10):
    'Return the last n lines of a file'
    return deque(open(filename), n)
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, this reads the entire file contents, but it's a neat and terse way of implementing tail.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><pre><code>def tail(f):
    f.seek(0, 2)

    while True:
        line = f.readline()

        if not line:
            time.sleep(0.1)
            continue

        yield line

def process_matches(matchtext):
    while True:
        line = (yield)  
        if matchtext in line:
            do_something_useful() # email alert, etc.


list_of_matches = ['ERROR', 'CRITICAL']
matches = [process_matches(string_match) for string_match in list_of_matches]    

for m in matches: # prime matches
    m.next()

while True:
    auditlog = tail( open(log_file_to_monitor) )
    for line in auditlog:
        for m in matches:
            m.send(line)
</code></pre>

<p>I use this to monitor log files.  In the full implementation, I keep list_of_matches in a configuration file so it can be used for multiple purposes.  On my list of enhancements is support for regex instead of a simple 'in' match.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>To my knowledge there's no equivalent to "tail" in the Python function list. Solution would be to use tell() (get file size) and read() to work out the ending lines.</p>

<p>This blog post (not by me) has the function written out, looks appropriate to me!
