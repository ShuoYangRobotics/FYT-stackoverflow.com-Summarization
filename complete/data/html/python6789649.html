<h3>Question (ID-6789649):</h3><h2>How can I get this Python code to run more quickly? [Project Euler Problem #7]</h2><p>I'm trying to complete this Project Euler challenge:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can
  see that the 6th prime is 13.</p>
  
  <p>What is the 10 001st prime number?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My code seem to be right because it works with small numbers, e.g 6th prime is 13.</p>

<p>How can i improve it so that the code will run much more quickly for larger numbers such as 10 001.</p>

<p>Code is below:</p>

<pre><code>#Checks if a number is a prime
def is_prime(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n%i == 0:
            return False
            break
        else:
            count += 1
    if count == n-2:
        return True

#Finds the value for the given nth term     
def term(n):
    x = 0
    count = 0
    while count != n:
        x += 1
        if is_prime(x) == True:
            count += 1
    print x


term(10001)
</code></pre>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>Thanks for your responses. I should have been more clear, I am not looking to speed up the interpreter or finding a faster interpreter, because i know my code isn't great, so i was looking for ways of make my code more efficient.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The purpose of Project Euler is not really to think learn programming, but to think about <strong>algorithms</strong>. On problem #10, your algorithm will need to be even faster than on #7, etc. etc. So you need to come up with a better way to find prime numbers, not a faster way to run Python code. People solve these problems under the time limit with far slower computers that you're using now by thinking about the <strong>math</strong>.</p>

<p>On that note, maybe ask about your prime number algorithm on <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/">http://math.stackexchange.com/</a> if you really need help thinking about the problem.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>A few questions to ponder:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do you really need to check the division until n-1? How earlier can you stop?</li>
<li>Apart from 2, do you really need to check the division by all the multiples of two ?</li>
<li>What about the multiples of 3? 5? Is there a way to extend this idea to all the multiples of previously tested primes?</li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>A faster interpreter won't cut it. Even an implementation written in C or assembly language won't be fast enough (to be in the "about one second" timeframe of project Euler). To put it bluntly, your algorithm is pathetic. Some research and thinking will help you write an algorithm that runs faster in a dog-slow interpreter than your current algorithm implemented in native code (I won't name any specifics, partly because that's your job and partly because I can't tell offhand how much optimization will be needed).</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Without discussing your algorithm, the <a href="http://pypy.org/" rel="nofollow">PyPy</a> interpreter can be ridiculously faster than the normal CPython one for tight numerical computation like this. You might want to try it out.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Many of the Euler problems (including this one) are designed to have a solution that computes in acceptable time on pretty much any given hardware and compiler (well, not INTERCAL on a PDP-11 maybe).</p>

<p>You algorithm works, but it has quadratic complexity. Using a faster interpreter will give you a linear performance boost, but the quadratic complexity will dwarf it long before you calculate 10,000 primes. There are algorithms with much lower complexity; find them (or google them, no shame in that and you'll still learn a lot) and implement them.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>As most people have said, it's all about coming up with the correct algorithm.  Have you considered looking at a
