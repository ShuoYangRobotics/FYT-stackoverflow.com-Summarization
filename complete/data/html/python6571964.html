<h3>Question (ID-6571964):</h3><h2>Which tool to use to parse programming languages in Python?</h2><p>Which Python tool can you recommend to parse programming languages? It should allow for a readable representation of the language grammar inside the source, and it should be able to scale to complicated languages (something with a grammar as complex as e.g. Python itself).</p>

<p>When I search, I mostly find pyparsing, which I will be evaluating, but of course I'm interested in other alternatives.</p>

<p>Edit: Bonus points if it comes with good error reporting and source code locations attached to syntax tree elements.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I really like <a href="http://fdik.org/pyPEG/" rel="nofollow" title="pyPEG: Parsing Expression Grammar for Python">pyPEG</a>. It's error reporting isn't very friendly, but it can add source code locations to the AST.</p>

<p>pyPEG doesn't have a separate lexer, which would make parsing Python itself hard (I think CPython recognises indent and dedent in the lexer), but I've used pyPEG to build a parser for subset of C# with surprisingly little work.</p>

<p>An example adapted from <a href="http://fdik.org/pyPEG/" rel="nofollow" title="pyPEG: Parsing Expression Grammar for Python">fdik.org/pyPEG/</a>: A simple language like this:</p>

<pre><code>function fak(n) {
    if (n==0) { // 0! is 1 by definition
        return 1;
    } else {
        return n * fak(n - 1);
    };
}
</code></pre>

<p>A pyPEG parser for that language:</p>

<pre><code>def comment():          return [re.compile(r"//.*"),
                                re.compile("/\*.*?\*/", re.S)]
def literal():          return re.compile(r'\d*\.\d*|\d+|".*?"')
def symbol():           return re.compile(r"\w+")
def operator():         return re.compile(r"\+|\-|\*|\/|\=\=")
def operation():        return symbol, operator, [literal, functioncall]
def expression():       return [literal, operation, functioncall]
def expressionlist():   return expression, -1, (",", expression)
def returnstatement():  return keyword("return"), expression
def ifstatement():      return (keyword("if"), "(", expression, ")", block,
                                keyword("else"), block)
def statement():        return [ifstatement, returnstatement], ";"
def block():            return "{", -2, statement, "}"
def parameterlist():    return "(", symbol, -1, (",", symbol), ")"
def functioncall():     return symbol, "(", expressionlist, ")"
def function():         return keyword("function"), symbol, parameterlist, block
def simpleLanguage():   return function

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If you're evaluating PyParsing, I think you should look at funcparserlib: <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/funcparserlib" rel="nofollow">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/funcparserlib</a></p>

<p>It's a bit similar, but in my experience resulting code is much cleaner.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>For a more complicated parser I would use pyparsing.
<a href="http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/" rel="nofollow">Pyparsing</a></p>

<p>Here is the parsed example from there home page</p>

<pre><code>from pyparsing import Word, alphas
greet = Word( alphas ) + "," + Word( alphas ) + "!" # &lt;-- grammar defined here
hello = "Hello, World!"
print hello, "-&gt;", greet.parseString( hello )
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Antlr generates LL(*) parsers. That can be good, but sometimes removing all left recursion can be cumbersome.</p>

<p>If you are LALR(1)-savvy, you can use <a href="http://www.freenet.org.nz/python/pybison/" rel="nofollow">PyBison</a>. It has similar syntax to Yacc, if you know what it is. Plus, there are a lot of people out there that know how yacc works.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Ned Batchelder did a survey of python parsing tools, which apparently he keeps updated (last updated July 2010):</p>

<p>If I was going to need a parser today, I would either roll my own recursive descent parser, or possibly use <a href="http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/" rel="nofollow">PLY</a> or <a href="http://www.acooke.org/lepl/" rel="nofollow">LEPL</a> -- depending on my needs and whether or not I was willing to introduce an external dependency. I wouldn't personally use PyParsing for anything very complicated.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>for the error reporting: did you detect, that pyPEG has a tracing facility? Just set pyPEG.print_trace = True, and pyPEG will give you a full trace of what's happening inside.</p>

<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>For <em>simple</em> task I tend to use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/shlex.html?highlight=shlex#module-shlex" rel="nofollow">shlex</a> module.</p>
