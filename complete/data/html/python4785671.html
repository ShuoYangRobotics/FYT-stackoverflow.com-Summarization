<h3>Question (ID-4785671):</h3><h2>Reading from a text file</h2><p>I'm not looking for an answer here but rather a guideline of how I should be approaching this task.</p>

<p>I have a txt file that contains the following information:</p>

<pre><code>...
    1947q2        -0.6
    1947q3        -0.3
    1947q4         6.2
    1948q1         6.5
    1948q2         7.6
    1948q3         2.2
    1948q4         0.6
...
</code></pre>

<p>My objective is to be able to read the text file based on a keyword selection. For example I want to read the lines that contain only 1947 so the output would be like:</p>

<pre><code>    1947q2        -0.6
    1947q3        -0.3
    1947q4         6.2
</code></pre>

<p>Because the numbers are tied to each year, I was thinking of putting each row in a tuple then combining all the tuples into a list. From this list, use regular expressions to search the list to get the tuples that match and print them out accordingly.</p>

<p>Is this an acceptable way to do it? Is there a simpler more obvious solution to this? Not really looking for the optimal method but rather different ideas on how to approach this problem.</p>

for line in open('file.txt'):

    sys.stdout.write(line)
</code></pre>

<p>You can also parse each line in the body of the <code>for</code> loop and then decide whether to accept it. If you want to get fancy, have a look at <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#map" rel="nofollow">map</a> and <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/itertools.html#itertools.ifilter" rel="nofollow">filter</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>One thing you can do is to <a href="http://www.dabeaz.com/generators/Generators.pdf" rel="nofollow">use generators</a> to filter out members of the list dynamically using a similar method to what you have done already:</p>

<pre><code>data = open("file.txt")
fortysevens = (line for line in data if contains_47(line))
for line in fortysevens:
    # do something here

def contains_47(line):
    # your existing code here to detect if a line contains 47
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Is your keyword always going to be the year? If so, I would store them in a dictionary like this:</p>

<pre><code>mydata[year][quarter] = value
</code></pre>

<p>So you could get to your example data via mydata['1947'].</p>

<p>To read the file, you might want to use csv.reader, then split the first column on 'q' to get the year and quarter individually.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I'd write code that took all of the lines in the function returned a sequence of tuples like (1947, 3, -7.0). Then its a simple iteration over the result to figure out which ones I really want.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>If the data in the lines of the input file are fixed -- as they appear to be -- then something as simple as this would work:</p>

<pre><code>with open('data.txt') as data:
    for line in data:
        if line[4:8] == '1947':
            print line,

# output:
#     1947q2        -0.6
#     1947q3        -0.3
#     1947q4         6.2
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the reason I used <code>print line,</code> is because each line string ends with a newline.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>As far as I know, regexes have been invented for this kind of job.</p>

<p>A regex will search directly the "lines containing the keyword" . A regex's search can also be based on more complex conditions that will be expressed in a more condensed code than with use of a clumsy "for line in f" loop.</p>

<p>My motto is : "There are no lines" in a text file. It's only a sequence of characters.</p>

<p>What a "for line in f" loop do is to analyse a stream of data to detect the newlines and stop at them: that is a first detection. Then on each line found, one (or more) simple (or complex) condition(s) must be tested on each line detected : that is a second research.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a regex finds directly what is searched, without preliminary searching the newlines. Condition of a line and condition of a keyword in the line are tested at the same time.</p>

<pre><code>import re

keyw = '1947'
pat = re.compile('.*?' + keyw + '.*')

with open('thefile.txt','r') as f:
    keyworded_lines = pat.findall(f.read())

# do what you need with keyworded_lines
</code></pre>

<p>Note that in 'r' mode Python transforms all the newlines in '\n'. Since the point in a RE  doesn't match '\n', the RE needs only '.*' after the keyw.</p>
