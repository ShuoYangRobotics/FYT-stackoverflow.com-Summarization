<h3>Question (ID-2200026):</h3><h2>Python: defining new functions on the fly using "with"</h2><p>I want to convert the following code:</p>

<pre><code>...
urls = [many urls]
links = []
funcs = []
for url in urls:
   func = getFunc(url, links)
   funcs.append(func)
...

def getFunc(url, links):
   def func():
      page = open(url)
      link = searchForLink(page)
      links.append(link)
   return func
</code></pre>

<p>into the much more convenient code:</p>

<pre><code>urls = [many urls]
links = []
funcs = []
for url in urls:
   &lt;STATEMENT&gt;(funcs):
        page = open(url)
        link = searchForLink(page)
        links.append(link)
</code></pre>

<p>I was hoping to do this with the <code>with</code> statement. As I commented bellow, I was hoping to achieve:</p>

<pre><code>def __enter__():
    def func():

..code in the for loop..

def __exit__():
  funcs.append(func)
</code></pre>

<p>Of course this doesn't work.</p>

<p>List comprehensions is not good for cases were the action <code>searchForLink</code> is not just one function but many functions. It would turn into an extremely unreadable code. For example even this would be problematic with list comprehensions:</p>

<pre><code>for url in urls:
  page = open(url)
  link1 = searchForLink(page)
  link2 = searchForLink(page)
  actionOnLink(link1)
  actionOnLink(link2)
  .... many more of these actions...
  links.append(link1)
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>It makes no sense to use <code>with</code> here. Instead use a list comprehension:</p>

<pre><code>funcs = [getFunc(url, links) for url in urls]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>A bit unconventional, but you can have a decorator register the func and bind any loop variables as default arguments:</p>

<pre><code>urls = [many urls]
links = []
funcs = []

for url in urls:
    @funcs.append
    def func(url=url):
        page = open(url)
        link = searchForLink(page)
        links.append(link)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Lose the line <code>&lt;STATEMENT&gt;(funcs):</code></p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>I mean:  why would you do this?  Why define a new function for each page?  Why not just do this?</p>

<pre><code>urls = [many urls]
links = []
for url in urls:
    page = open(url)
    link = searchForLink(page)
    links.append(link) 
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>There are only two ways to create functions: <code>def</code> and <code>lambda</code>. Lambdas are meant for tiny functions, so they may not be very appropriate for your case. However, if you really want to, you can enclose two lambdas within each other:</p>

<pre><code>urls = [many urls]
links = []
funcs = [(lambda x:
            lambda:
              links.append(searchForLink(open(x))))(u)
         for u in urls]
</code></pre>

<p>A little too LISPish for my taste.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You should not use "with" to do this (even though, given that it's Python, you almost certainly could, using some bizarre side-effect and Python's dynamicism).  </p>

<p>The purpose of "with" in Python is, <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-with-statement" rel="nofollow">as described in the docs</a>, "to wrap the execution of a block with methods defined by a context manager. This allows common try...except...finally usage patterns to be encapsulated for convenient reuse."</p>

<p>I think you're confusing Python's "with" with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/index.php?title=En/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Statements/With" rel="nofollow">Javascript</a>/<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wc500chb%28VS.80%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">VisualBasic</a> "with", which may be cosmetically similar but which is effectively unrelated.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Good old <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/itertools.html" rel="nofollow">itertools</a>.</p>

<pre><code>from itertools import imap
links.extend(imap(searchForLink, imap(open, urls)))
</code></pre>

<p>Although, maybe you'd prefer <a href="http://oakwinter.com/code/functional/" rel="nofollow">functional</a>.</p>

<pre><code>from functional import *
funcs = [partial(compose(compose(links.append, searchForLink), open), url) for url in urls]
for func in funcs: func()
</code></pre>

<p>I don't think it's worthwhile creating a class for <code>with</code> use: it's more work to create <code>__enter__</code> and <code>__exit__</code> than it is to just write a helper function.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>You may be better using generators to achieve the delayed computation you're after.</p>

<pre><code>def MakeLinks(urls):
    for url in urls:
        page = open(url)
        link = searchForLink(page)
        yield link

links = MakeLinks(urls)
</code></pre>

<p>When you want the links:</p>

<pre><code>for link in links:
    print link
</code></pre>

<p>The urls will be looked up during this loop, and not all at once (which it looks like you're tring to avoid).</p>
