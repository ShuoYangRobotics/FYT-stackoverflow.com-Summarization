<h3>Question (ID-534375):</h3><h2>Passing values in Python</h2><p>When you pass a collection like list, array to another function in python, does it make a copy of it, or is it just a pointer?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Python passes references-to-objects by
  value (like Java), and everything in
  Python is an object. This sounds
  simple, but then you will notice that
  some data types seem to exhibit
  pass-by-value characteristics, while
  others seem to act like
  pass-by-reference... what's the deal?</p>
  
  <p>It is important to understand mutable
  and immutable objects. Some objects,
  like strings, tuples, and numbers, are
  immutable.  Altering them inside a
  function/method will create a new
  instance and the original instance
  outside the function/method is not
  changed.  Other objects, like lists
  and dictionaries are mutable, which
  means you can change the object
  in-place.  Therefore, altering an
  object inside a function/method will
  also change the original object
  outside.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Thing is, the whole reference/value concept won't fit into python. Python has no "value" of a variable. Python has only objects and names that refer to objects.</p>

<p>So when you call a function and put a "name" inside the parenthesis, like this:</p>

<pre><code>def func(x): # defines a function that takes an argument
    ... # do something here

func(myname) # calling the function
</code></pre>

<p>The actual object that <code>myname</code> is pointing is passed, not the <strong>name</strong> <code>myname</code> <strong>itself</strong>. Inside the function <strong>another name</strong> (<code>x</code>) is given to refer to the same object passed. </p>

<p>You can modify the object inside the function if it is mutable, but you <strong>can't change what the outside name is pointing to</strong>. Just the same that happens when you do </p>

<pre><code>anothername = myname
</code></pre>

<p>Therefore I can answer your question with:  </p>

<p><strong>it is "pass by value" but all values are just references to objects.</strong></p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>A refernce is passed but if the parameter is an immutable object, modifying it within the method will create a new instance.</p>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The object is passed.  Not a copy, but a reference to the underlying object.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I would also recommend looking at the <code>copy</code> module:</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.python.org/library/copy.html" rel="nofollow">Python documentation for copy</a></p>

<p>It will help you to understand the underlying issues and how to use it to perform your own deep copy.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>By reference:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = [0,1,2,3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; def foo(x_list):
    x_list[0] = 1


&gt;&gt;&gt; foo(x)
&gt;&gt;&gt; x
[1, 1, 2, 3]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/21196/harper-shelby">@Harper</a> this will not work when x is a number,string or a tuple.</p>

<p>To put it in simple words, we can say that in python functions, the parameters passed are references to the objects and these references are passed by value.</p>
