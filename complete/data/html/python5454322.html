<h3>Question (ID-5454322):</h3><h2>Python: How to match nested parentheses with regex?</h2><p>I'm trying to match a mathematical-expression-like string, that have nested parentheses.</p>

<pre><code>import re

p = re.compile('\(.+\)')
str = '(((1+0)+1)+1)'
print p.findall(s)
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>['(((1+0)+1)+1)']</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wanted it to match all the enclosed expressions, such as (1+0), ((1+0)+1)...<br>
I don't even care if it matches unwanted ones like (((1+0), I can take care of those.</p>

<p>Why it's not doing that already, and how can I do it?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Regex languages aren't powerful enough to matching arbitrarily nested constructs. For that you need a push-down automaton (i.e., a parser). There are several such tools available, such as <a href="http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/" rel="nofollow">PLY</a>.</p>

<p>Python also provides a <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/parser.html" rel="nofollow">parser library</a> for its own syntax, which might do what you need. The output is extremely detailed, however, and takes a while to wrap your head around. If you're interested in this angle, the following discussion tries to explain things as simply as possible.</p>

<p>You can ease the pain with this short function:</p>

<pre><code>def shallow(ast):
    if not isinstance(ast, list): return ast
    if len(ast) == 2: return shallow(ast[1])
    return [ast[0]] + [shallow(a) for a in ast[1:]]

   '+',

<p>The numbers come from the Python modules <code>symbol</code> and <code>token</code>, which you can use to build a lookup table from numbers to names:</p>

<pre><code>map = dict(token.tok_name.items() + symbol.sym_name.items())
</code></pre>

<p>You could even fold this mapping into the <code>shallow()</code> function so you can work with strings instead of numbers:</p>

<pre><code>def shallow(ast):
    if not isinstance(ast, list): return ast

    return [map[ast[0]]] + [shallow(a) for a in ast[1:]]

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>As others have mentioned, regular expressions are not the way to go for nested constructs. I'll give a basic example using <a href="http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/" rel="nofollow">pyparsing</a>:</p>

<pre><code>import pyparsing # make sure you have this installed

thecontent = pyparsing.Word(pyparsing.alphanums) | '+' | '-'
parens     = pyparsing.nestedExpr( '(', ')', content=thecontent)
</code></pre>

<p>Here's a usage example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; parens.parseString("((a + b) + c)")
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>

<pre><code>(                          # all of str
 [
  (                        # ((a + b) + c)
   [
    (                      #  (a + b)
     ['a', '+', 'b'], {}   
    ),                     #  (a + b)      [closed]
    '+',
    'c'
   ], {}
  )                        # ((a + b) + c) [closed]
 ], {}  
)                          # all of str    [closed]
</code></pre>

<p>(With newlining/indenting/comments done manually)</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Modified to eliminate unnecessary <code>Forward</code>, as per Paul McGuire's suggestions. </p>

<p>To get the output in nested list format:</p>

<pre><code>res = parens.parseString("((12 + 2) + 3)")
res.asList()
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>

<pre><code>[[['12', '+', '2'], '+', '3']]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>The regular expression tries to match as much of the text as possible, thereby consuming all of your string. It doesn't look for additional matches of the regular expression on parts of that string. That's why you only get one answer.</p>

<p>The solution is to not use regular expressions. If you are actually trying to parse math expressions, use a real parsing solutions. If you really just want to capture the pieces within parenthesis, just loop over the characters counting when you see ( and ) and increment a decrement a counter. </p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You should write a proper parser for parsing such expression (e.g. using pyparsing). 
Regular expressions are not an appropriate tool for writing decent parsers.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I believe this function may suit your need, I threw this together fast so feel free to clean it up a bit. When doing nests its easy to think of it backwards and work from there =]</p>

<pre><code>def fn(string,endparens=False):
    exp = []
    idx = -1

        if char == "(":

        elif char == ")":
            idx -= 1
            if idx != -1:
                exp[idx] = "(" + exp[idx+1] + ")"
        else:

</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Balanced pairs (of parentheses, for example) is an example of a language that cannot be recognized by regular expressions.  </p>

<p>What follows is a brief explanation of the math for why that is.</p>

<p>Regular expressions are a way of defining finite state automata (abbreviated FSM).  Such a device has a finite amount of possible state to store information.  How that state can be used is not particularly restricted, but it does mean that there are an absolute maximum number of distinct positions it can recognize.  </p>

<p>For example, the state can be used for counting, say, unmatched left parentheses.  But because the amount of state for that kind of counting must be completely bounded, then a given FSM can count to a maximum of <em>n</em>-1, where <em>n</em> is the number of states the FSM can be in.  If <em>n</em> is, say, 10, then the maximum number of unmatched left parenthesis the FSM can match is 10, until it breaks.  Since it's perfectly possible to have one more left parenthesis, there is no possible FSM that can correctly recognize the complete language of matched parentheses.  </p>

<p>So what?  Suppose you just pick a really large <em>n</em>?  The problem is that as a way of describing FSM, regular expressions basically describe all of the <em>transitions</em> from one state to another.  Since for any N, an FSM would need 2 state transitions (one for matching a left parenthesis, and one for matching right), the regular expression itself must grow by at least a constant factor multiple of <em>n</em></p>

<p>By comparison, the next better class of languages, (context free grammars) can solve this problem in a totally compact way.  Here's an example in BNF</p>

<blockquote>
<code>
<em>expression</em> ::= `<strong>(</strong>` <em>expression</em> `<strong>)</strong>` <em>expression</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>nothing</em><br />
&nbsp;
</code></blockquote>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>You can use regexps, but you need to do the recursion yourself. Something like the following does the trick (if you only need to find, as your question says, all the expressions enclosed into parentheses):</p>

<pre><code>import re

def scan(p, string):
    found = p.findall(string)
    for substring in found:
        stripped = substring[1:-1]
        found.extend(scan(p, stripped))
    return found

p = re.compile('\(.+\)')
string = '(((1+0)+1)+1)'
all_found = scan(p, string)
print all_found
</code></pre>

<p>This code, however, does not match the 'correct' parentheses. If you need to do that you will be better off with a specialized parser.</p>
