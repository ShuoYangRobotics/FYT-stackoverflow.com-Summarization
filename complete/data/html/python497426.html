<h3>Question (ID-497426):</h3><h2>Deleting multiple elements from a list</h2><p>Is it possible to delete multiple elements from a list at the same time? If I want to delete elements at index 0 and 2, and try something like del somelist[0], followed by del somelist[2], the second statement will actually delete somelist[3].</p>

<p>I suppose I could always delete the higher numbered elements first but I'm hoping there is a better way.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>If you're deleting multiple non-adjacent items, then what you describe is the best way (and yes, be sure to start from the highest index).</p>

<p>If your items are adjacent, you can use the slice assignment syntax:</p>

<pre><code>a[2:10] = []
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>prob not the best, but here it goes:</p>

<pre><code>indices = 0, 2
somelist = [i for j, i in enumerate(somelist) if j not in indices]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>So, you essentially want to delete multiple elements in one pass?  In that case, the position of the next element to delete will be offset by however many were deleted previously.</p>

<p>Our goal is to delete all the vowels, which are precomputed to be indices 1, 4, and 7.  Note that its important the to_delete indices are in ascending order, otherwise it won't work.</p>

<pre><code>to_delete = [1, 4, 7]
target = list("hello world")
for offset, index in enumerate(to_delete):
  index -= offset
  del target[index]
</code></pre>

<p>It'd be a more complicated if you wanted to delete the elements in any order.  IMO, sorting <code>to_delete</code> might be easier than figuring out when you should or shouldn't subtract from <code>index</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>As a function:</p>

<pre><code>def multi_delete(list_, *args):
    indexes = sorted(list(args), reverse=True)
    for index in indexes:
        del list_[index]
    return list_
</code></pre>

<p>Runs in <strong>n log(n)</strong> time, which should make it the fastest correct solution yet.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You can do that way on a dict, not on a list. In a list elements are in sequence. In a dict they depend only on the index.</p>

<p>Simple code just to explain it <em>by doing</em>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; lst = ['a','b','c']
&gt;&gt;&gt; dct = {0: 'a', 1: 'b', 2:'c'}
&gt;&gt;&gt; lst[0]
'a'
&gt;&gt;&gt; dct[0]
'a'
&gt;&gt;&gt; del lst[0]
&gt;&gt;&gt; del dct[0]
&gt;&gt;&gt; lst[0]
'b'
&gt;&gt;&gt; dct[0]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;pyshell#19&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    dct[0]
KeyError: 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; dct[1]
'b'
&gt;&gt;&gt; lst[1]
'c'
</code></pre>

<p>A way to "convert" a list in a dict is:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; dct = {}
&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in xrange(0,len(lst)): dct[i] = lst[i]
</code></pre>

<p>The inverse is:</p>

<pre><code>lst = [dct[i] for i in sorted(dct.keys())]
</code></pre>

<p>Anyway I think it's better to start deleting from the higher index as you said.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I can actually think of two ways to do it:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>slice the list like (this deletes the 1st,3rd and 8th elements)</p>

<p>somelist = somelist[1:2]+somelist[3:7]+somelist[8:]</p></li>
<li><p>do that in place, but one at a time:</p>

<p>somelist.pop(2)
somelist.pop(0)</p></li>
</ol>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>As a specialisation of Greg's answer, you can even use extended slice syntax. eg. If you wanted to delete items 0 and 2:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a= [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
&gt;&gt;&gt; del a[0:3:2]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
[1, 3, 4]
</code></pre>

<p>This doesn't cover any arbitrary selection, of course, but it can certainly work for deleting any two items.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>here is another method which removes the elements in place. also if your list is really long, it is faster.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = range(10)
&gt;&gt;&gt; remove = [0,4,5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; from collections import deque
&gt;&gt;&gt; deque((list.pop(a, i) for i in sorted(remove, reverse=True)), maxlen=0)

&gt;&gt;&gt; timeit.timeit('[i for j, i in enumerate(a) if j not in remove]', setup='import random;remove=[random.randrange(100000) for i in range(100)]; a = range(100000)', number=1)
0.1704120635986328

&gt;&gt;&gt; timeit.timeit('deque((list.pop(a, i) for i in sorted(remove, reverse=True)), maxlen=0)', setup='from collections import deque;import random;remove=[random.randrange(100000) for i in range(100)]; a = range(100000)', number=1)
