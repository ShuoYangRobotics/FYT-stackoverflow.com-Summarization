<h3>Question (ID-2322355):</h3><h2>proper name for python * operator?</h2><p>What is the correct name for operator <code>*</code>, as in <code>function(*args)</code>?  unpack, unzip, something else?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>In Ruby and Perl 6 this has been called "splat", and I think most people from those communities will figure out what you mean if you call it that.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/controlflow.html#unpacking-argument-lists" rel="nofollow">Python tutorial</a> uses the phrase "unpacking argument lists", which is long and descriptive.  I haven't heard any other particular name for it in Python.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I call it "positional expansion", as opposed to <code>**</code> which I call "keyword expansion".</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I say "star-args" and Python people seem to know what i mean.</p>

<p><code>**</code> is trickier - I think just "qargs" since it is usually used as <code>**kw</code> or <code>**kwargs</code> </p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/controlflow.html#unpacking-argument-lists" rel="nofollow">Python Tutorial</a> is simply calls it 'the <code>*</code>-operator'. It performs unpacking of <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/controlflow.html#arbitrary-argument-lists" rel="nofollow">arbitrary argument lists</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>One can also call <code>*</code> a <strong>gather parameter</strong> (when used in function arguments definition) or a <strong>scatter operator</strong> (when used at function invocation).</p>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I believe it's most commonly called the "splat operator." <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1141504/name-this-python-ruby-language-construct-using-array-values-to-satisfy-function">Unpacking arguments</a> is what is does.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I call *args "star args" or "varargs" and **kwargs "keyword args".</p>
