<h3>Question (ID-125222):</h3><h2>extracting text from MS word files in python</h2><p>for working with MS word files in python, there is python win32 extensions, which can be used in windows. How do I do the same in linux?
Is there any library?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-9):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You could make a subprocess call to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiword" rel="nofollow">antiword</a>.  Antiword is a linux commandline utility for dumping text out of a word doc.  Works pretty well for simple documents (obviously it loses formatting).  It's available through apt, and probably as RPM, or you could compile it yourself.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>OpenOffice.org can be scripted with Python: <a href="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Python" rel="nofollow">see here</a>.</p>

<p>Since OOo can load most MS Word files flawlessly, I'd say that's your best bet.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Take a look at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/124869/how-does-the-doc-format-work" rel="nofollow" title="how the doc format works">how the doc format works</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/124959/create-word-document-using-php-in-lunux" rel="nofollow" title="create word document using php in linux">create word document using PHP in linux</a>. The former is especially useful. <a href="http://www.abisource.com/" rel="nofollow" title="abiword">Abiword</a> is my recommended tool. There are <a href="http://www.abisource.com/wiki/Microsoft_Word_documents" rel="nofollow" title="Abiword limitations">limitations</a> though:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, if the document has complicated tables, text boxes, embedded spreadsheets, and so forth, then it might not work as expected. Developing good MS Word filters is a very difficult process, so please bear with us as we work on getting Word documents to open correctly. If you have a Word document which fails to load, please open a Bug and include the document so we can improve the importer. </p>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I know this is an old question, but I was recently trying to find a way to extract text from MS word files, and the best solution by far I found was with wvLib:</p>

<p><a href="http://wvware.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">http://wvware.sourceforge.net/</a></p>

<p>After installing the library, using it in Python is pretty easy:</p>

<pre><code>import commands

exe = 'wvText ' + word_file + ' ' + output_txt_file
out = commands.getoutput(exe)
exe = 'cat ' + output_txt_file
out = commands.getoutput(exe)
</code></pre>

<p>And that's it.  Pretty much, what we're doing is using the commands.getouput function to run a couple of shell scripts, namely wvText (which extracts text from a Word document, and cat to read the file output).  After that, the entire text from the Word document will be in the out variable, ready to use.</p>

<p>Hopefully this will help anyone having similar issues in the future.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>(Note: I posted this on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1184747/rtf-doc-docx-text-extraction-in-program-written-in-c-qt">this question</a> as well, but it seems relevant here, so please excuse the repost.)</p>

<p>Now, this is pretty ugly and pretty hacky, but it seems to work for me for basic text extraction. Obviously to use this in a Qt program you'd have to spawn a process for it etc, but the command line I've hacked together is:</p>

<pre><code>unzip -p file.docx | grep '&lt;w:t' | sed 's/&lt;[^&lt;]*&gt;//g' | grep -v '^[[:space:]]*$'
</code></pre>

<p>So that's:</p>

<p><em>unzip -p file.docx</em>: -p == "unzip to stdout"</p>

<p><em>grep '&lt;w:t'</em>:  Grab just the lines containing '&lt;w:t' (&lt;w:t&gt; is the Word 2007 XML element for "text", as far as I can tell)</p>

<p><em>sed 's/&lt;[^&lt;]</em>>//g'*: Remove everything inside tags</p>

<p><em>grep -v '^[[:space:]]</em>$'*: Remove blank lines</p>

<p>There is likely a more efficient way to do this, but it seems to work for me on the few docs I've tested it with.</p>

<p>As far as I'm aware, unzip, grep and sed all have ports for Windows and any of the Unixes, so it should be reasonably cross-platform. Despit being a bit of an ugly hack ;)</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>benjamin's answer is a pretty good one.  I have just consolidated...</p>

<pre><code>import zipfile, re

docx = zipfile.ZipFile('/path/to/file/mydocument.docx')
content = docx.read('word/document.xml')
cleaned = re.sub('&lt;(.|\n)*?&gt;','',content)
print cleaned
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>If your intention is to use purely python modules without calling a subprocess, you can use the zipfile python modude.</p>

<pre><code>content = ""
# Load DocX into zipfile
docx = zipfile.ZipFile('/home/whateverdocument.docx')
# Unpack zipfile
unpacked = docx.infolist()
# Find the /word/document.xml file in the package and assign it to variable
for item in unpacked:
    if item.orig_filename == 'word/document.xml':
        content = docx.read(item.orig_filename)

    else:
        pass
</code></pre>

<p>Your content string however needs to be cleaned up, one way of doing this is:</p>

<pre><code># Clean the content string from xml tags for better search
fullyclean = []
halfclean = content.split('&lt;')
for item in halfclean:
    if '&gt;' in item:
        bad_good = item.split('&gt;')
        if bad_good[-1] != '':
            fullyclean.append(bad_good[-1])
        else:
            pass
    else:
        pass

# Assemble a new string with all pure content
content = " ".join(fullyclean)
</code></pre>

<p>But there is surely a more elegant way to clean up the string, probably using the re module.
Hope this helps.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Use the native Python docx module. Here's how to extract all the text from a doc:</p>

<pre><code>document = opendocx('Hello world.docx')

# This location is where most document content lives 
docbody = document.xpath('/w:document/w:body', namespaces=wordnamespaces)[0]

# Extract all text
print getdocumenttext(document)
</code></pre>

<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>I'm not sure if you're going to have much lock without using COM. The .doc format is ridiculously complex, and is often called a "memory dump" of Word at the time of saving!</p>

<p>At Swati, that's in HTML, which is fine and dandy, but most word documents aren't so nice!</p>
