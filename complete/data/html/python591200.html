<h3>Question (ID-591200):</h3><h2>Can I use a decorator to mutate the local scope of a function in Python?</h2><p>Is there any way of writing a decorator such that the following would work?</p>

<pre><code>assert 'z' not in globals()

@my_decorator
def func(x, y):
   print z
</code></pre>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>EDIT: moved from anwser</p>

<p>In answer to hop's "why?": syntax sugar / DRY.</p>

<p>It's not about caching, it's about calculating z (and z1, z2, z3, ...) based upon the values of x &amp; y.</p>

<p>I have lots of functions which do related things, and I don't want to do have to write</p>

<pre><code>z1, z2, z3=calculate_from(x, y)
</code></pre>

<p>at the beginning of every single function - I'll get it wrong somewhere. If this were c I'd do this with cpp (if this were lisp, I'd do this with macros ...), but I wanted to see if decorators could do the same thing.</p>

<p>If it helps, I'd almost certainly call the decorator "precalculate_z", and it certainly wouldn't be part of any public API.</p>

<p>I could probably get a similar effect from using the class infrastructure as well, but I wanted to see if it was doable with raw functions.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I don't know about the local scope, but you could provide an alternative global name space temporarily.  Something like:</p>

<pre>
<code>

import types

def my_decorator(fn):
    def decorated(*args,**kw):
        my_globals={}
        my_globals.update(globals())
        my_globals['z']='value of z'
        call_fn=types.FunctionType(fn.func_code,my_globals)
        return call_fn(*args,**kw)
    return decorated

@my_decorator
def func(x, y):
    print z

func(0,1)

</code>
</pre>

<p>Which should print "value of z"</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Echoing Hop's answer</p>

<ol>
<li>Don't do it.</li>
<li>Seriously, don't do this.  Lisp and Ruby are more appropriate languages for writing your own custom syntax.  Use one of those.  Or find a cleaner way to do this</li>
<li>If you must, you want dynamic scoped variables, not lexically scoped.</li>
</ol>

<p>Python doesn't have dynamically scoped variables, but you can simulate it.  Here's an example that simulates it by creating a global binding, but restores the previous value on exit:</p>

<p><a href="http://codepad.org/6vAY8Leh" rel="nofollow" title="dynamic scope in python">http://codepad.org/6vAY8Leh</a></p>

<pre><code>def adds_dynamic_z_decorator(f):
  def replacement(*arg,**karg):
    # create a new 'z' binding in globals, saving previous
    if 'z' in globals():
      oldZ = (globals()['z'],)
    else:
      oldZ = None
    try:
      globals()['z'] = None
      #invoke the original function
      res = f(*arg, **karg)
    finally:
      #restore any old bindings
      if oldZ:
        globals()['z'] = oldZ[0]
      else:
        del(globals()['z'])
    return res
  return replacement

@adds_dynamic_z_decorator
def func(x,y):
  print z

def other_recurse(x):
  global z
  print 'x=%s, z=%s' %(x,z)
  recurse(x+1)
  print 'x=%s, z=%s' %(x,z)

@adds_dynamic_z_decorator
def recurse(x=0):
  global z
  z = x
  if x &lt; 3:
    other_recurse(x)

print 'calling func(1,2)'
func(1,2)

print 'calling recurse()'
recurse()
</code></pre>

<p>I make no warranties on the utility or sanity of the above code.  Actually, I warrant that it <em>is</em> insane, and you should avoid using it unless you want a flogging from your Python peers.</p>

<p>This code is similar to both eduffy's and John Montgomery's code, but ensures that 'z' is created and properly restored "like" a local variable would be -- for instance, note how 'other_recurse' is able to see the binding for 'z' specified in the body of 'recurse'.  </p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>a) don't do it.</p>

<p>b) seriously, why would you do that?</p>

<p>c) you could declare z as global within your decorator, so z will not be in globals() until after the decorator has been called for the first time, so the assert won't bark.</p>

<p>d) why???</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I'll first echo the "please don't", but that's your choice.  Here's a solution for you:</p>

<pre><code>assert 'z' not in globals ()

class my_dec:
    def __init__ (self, f):
    	self.f = f
    def __call__ (self,x,y):
	    z = x+y
	    self.f(x,y,z)

@my_dec
def func (x,y,z):
    print z

func (1,3)
</code></pre>

<p>It does require <code>z</code> in the formal parameters, but not the actual.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p><em>I could probably get a similar effect from using the class infrastructure as well, but I wanted to see if it was doable with raw functions.</em></p>

<p>Well, Python is an object-oriented language. You should do this in a class, in my opinion.  Making a nice class interface would surely simplify your problem. This <strong>isn't</strong> what decorators were made for.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Explicit is better than implicit.</p>

<p>Is this good enough?</p>

<pre><code>def provide_value(f):
    f.foo = "Bar"
    return f

@provide_value
def g(x):
    print g.foo
</code></pre>

<p>(If you really want evil, assigning to f.func_globals seems fun.)</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Others have given a few ways of making a working decorator, many have advised against doing so because it's so stylistically different from normal python behavior that it'll really confuse anyone trying to understand the code.</p>

<p>If you're needing to recalculate things a lot, would it make sense to group them together in an object?  Compute z1...zN in the constructor, then the functions that use these values can access the pre-computed answers as part of the instance.</p>
