<h3>Question (ID-200599):</h3><h2>What's the best way to store simple user settings in Python?</h2><p>I'm programming (in Python) a website which will have users. These users will have a number of settings, such as their choice of colour scheme, etc. I'm happy to store these as plain text files, and security is not an issue.</p>

<p>The way I currently see it is: there's a dictionary, where all the keys are users and the values are dictionaries with the users' settings in them.</p>

<p>For example, userdb["bob"]["colour_scheme"] would have the value "blue".</p>

<p>What's the best way to store it on file? Pickling the dictionary?</p>

<p>Are there better ways of doing what I'm trying to do, anyway?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-13):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I don't tackle the question which one is best. If you want to handle text-files, I'd consider <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/lib/module-ConfigParser.html" rel="nofollow">ConfigParser -module</a>. Another you could give a try would be <a href="http://undefined.org/python/" rel="nofollow">simplejson</a> or <a href="http://www.yaml.org/" rel="nofollow">yaml</a>. You could also consider a real db table.</p>

<p>For instance, you could have a table called userattrs, with three columns:</p>

<ul>
<li>Int user_id</li>
<li>String attribute_name</li>
<li>String attribute_value</li>
</ul>

<p>If there's only few, you could store them into cookies for quick retrieval.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I would use the <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/lib/module-ConfigParser.html" rel="nofollow">ConfigParser</a> module, which produces some pretty readable and user-editable output for your example:</p>

<pre>[bob]
colour_scheme: blue
british: yes
[joe]
color_scheme: that's 'color', silly!
british: no</pre>

<p>The following code would produce the config file above, and then print it out:</p>

<pre><code>import sys
from ConfigParser import *

c = ConfigParser()

c.add_section("bob")
c.set("bob", "colour_scheme", "blue")
c.set("bob", "british", str(True))

c.add_section("joe")
c.set("joe", "color_scheme", "that's 'color', silly!")
c.set("joe", "british", str(False))

c.write(sys.stdout)  # this outputs the configuration to stdout
                     # you could put a file-handle here instead

for section in c.sections(): # this is how you read the options back in
    print section
    for option in c.options(section):
            print "\t", option, "=", c.get(section, option)

print c.get("bob", "british") # To access the "british" attribute for bob directly
</code></pre>

<p>Note that ConfigParser only supports strings, so you'll have to convert as I have above for the Booleans. See <a href="http://effbot.org/librarybook/configparser.htm" rel="nofollow">effbot</a> for a good run-down of the basics.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Using <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/lib/module-cPickle.html" rel="nofollow">cPickle</a> on the dictionary would be my choice. Dictionaries are a natural fit for these kind of data, so given your requirements I see no reason not to use them. That, unless you are thinking about reading them from non-python applications, in which case you'd have to use a language neutral text format. And even here you could get away with the pickle plus an export tool.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Here's the simplest way.  Use simple variables and <code>import</code> the settings file.</p>

<p>Call the file userprefs.py</p>

<pre><code># a user prefs file
color = 0x010203
font = "times new roman"
position = ( 12, 13 )
size = ( 640, 480 )
</code></pre>

<p>In your application, you need to be sure that you can import this file.  You have <em>many</em> choices.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Using <code>PYTHONPATH</code>.  Require <code>PYTHONPATH</code> be set to include the directory with the preferences files.</p>

<p>a.  An explicit command-line parameter to name the file (not the best, but simple)</p>

<p>b.  An environment variable to name the file.</p></li>
<li><p>Extending <code>sys.path</code> to include the user's home directory</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Example</p>

<pre><code>import sys
import os
sys.path.insert(0,os.path.expanduser("~"))
import userprefs 
print userprefs.color
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I would use <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/lib/module-shelve.html" rel="nofollow">shelve</a> or an <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/lib/module-sqlite3.html" rel="nofollow">sqlite</a> database if I would have to store these setting on the file system. Although, since you are building a website you probably use some kind of database so why not just use that?</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>For a database-driven website, of course, your best option is a db table. I'm assuming that you are not doing the database thing.</p>

<p>If you don't care about human-readable formats, then <code>pickle</code> is a simple and straightforward way to go. I've also heard good reports about <code>simplejson</code>.</p>

<p>If human readability is important, two simple options present themselves:</p>

<p><strong>Module:</strong> Just use a module. If all you need are a few globals and nothing fancy, then this is the way to go. If you really got desperate, you could define classes and class variables to emulate sections. The downside here: if the file will be hand-edited by a user, errors could be hard to catch and debug.</p>

<p><strong>INI format:</strong> I've been using <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/configobj.html" rel="nofollow">ConfigObj</a> for this, with quite a bit of success. ConfigObj is essentially a replacement for ConfigParser, with support for nested sections and much more. Optionally, you can define expected types or values for a file and validate it, providing a safety net (and important error feedback) for users/administrators.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>This sounds like a job for (quickly enter and exit a phonebooth) XML!  </p>

<p>(Or yaml or JSON or whatever your favorite data interchange language is)</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>If human readablity of configfiles matters an alternative might be <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/lib/module-ConfigParser.html" rel="nofollow">the ConfigParser module</a> which allows you to read and write .ini like files. But then you are restricted to one nesting level.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>The built-in <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/lib/module-sqlite3.html" rel="nofollow">sqlite3</a> module would probably be far simpler than most alternatives, and gets you ready to update to a full RDBMS should you ever want or need to.</p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>If you have a database, I might suggest storing the settings in the database. However, it sounds like ordinary files might suit your environment better.</p>

<p>You probably don't want to store <em>all</em> the users settings in the same file, because you might run into trouble with concurrent access to that one file. If you stored each user's settings as a dictionary in their own pickled file, then they would be able to act independently.</p>

<p>Pickling is a reasonable way to store such data, but unfortunately the pickle data format is notoriously not-human-readable. You might be better off storing it as <code>repr(dictionary)</code> which will be a more readable format. To reload the user settings, use <code>eval(open("file").read())</code> or something like that.</p>
<br /><b>#10</b><br /><p>Is there are particular reason you're not using the database for this? it seems the normal and natural thing to do - or store a pickle of the settings in the db keyed on user id or something.</p>

<p>You haven't described the usage patterns of the website, but just thinking of a general website - but I would think that keeping the settings in a database would cause much less disk I/O than using files.</p>

<p>OTOH, for settings that might be used by client-side code, storing them as javascript in a static file that can be cached would be handy - at the expense of having multiple places you might have settings. (I'd probably store those settings in  the db, and rebuild the static files as necessary)</p>
<br /><b>#11</b><br /><p>I agree with the reply about using Pickled Dictionary.  Very simple and effective for storing simple data in a Dictionary structure.</p>
<br /><b>#12</b><br /><p>If you don't care about being able to edit the file yourself, and want a quick way to persist python objects, go with <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/lib/module-pickle.html" rel="nofollow">pickle</a>. If you do want the file to be readable by a human, or readable by some other app, use <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/lib/module-ConfigParser.html" rel="nofollow">ConfigParser</a>. If you need anything more complex, go with some sort of database, be it relational (<a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/lib/module-sqlite3.html" rel="nofollow">sqlite</a>), or object-oriented (<a href="http://www.divmod.org/trac/wiki/DivmodAxiom" rel="nofollow">axiom</a>, <a href="http://wiki.zope.org/ZODB/FrontPage" rel="nofollow">zodb</a>).</p>
