<h3>Question (ID-6486659):</h3><h2>simple python question</h2><p>I have an extreemly simple question. so i have been making an mp3 player with tkinter and the module mp3play. Here is my probleme:</p>

<p>Say i had the song to play: C:\Music\song.mp3</p>

<p>and to play that song i have to run this script</p>

<pre><code>import mp3play
music_file=r'C:\Music\song.mp3'
clip = mp3play.load(music_file)
clip.play()
</code></pre>

<p>easy enough, my probleme though is getting the "r" there.</p>

<p>i have tried:</p>

<pre><code>import mp3play
import re
music_file="'C:\Music\song.mp3'"

music_file='r'+music_file
music_file=re.sub('"','',music_file)

print music_file
clip = mp3play.load(music_file)

clip.play()
</code></pre>

<p>Which gets the out put: r'C:\Music\song.mp3'
but it is a string so it wont read the file.</p>

<p>Please help this is very frustrating.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The 'r' in the front denotes a particular category of string called raw string. You can't get that by adding two strings or re substituting a  string. It is just a string type, but with the escape characters take care. </p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s = r'something'
&gt;&gt;&gt; s
'something'
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>When you are writing the script, use the 'r', if you are getting the input via raw_input, python will take care of escaping the characters. So, the question is why are you trying to do that?</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>try:</p>

<pre><code>music_file='C:/Music/song.mp3'
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>In Python, the <code>r</code> prefix introduces a <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-literals" rel="nofollow">raw string</a>. Outside of raw strings, backslash (<code>\</code>) characters are considered as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_character" rel="nofollow">escape characters</a> and have to be escaped themselves (by doubling them).</p>

<p>Try a simple string instead:</p>

<pre><code>music_file = 'C:\\Music\\song.mp3'
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The <code>r</code> you are talking about has to be placed before a string definition, and tells python that the following string is "raw", meaning it will ignore backslash escapes (so it doesn't error on invalid backslashes in filenames, for example).</p>

<p>Why don't you just do it like in the first example? I don't see what you are trying to accomplish in the second example.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>you can try <code>music_file = r'%s' % path_to_file</code></p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>As a few of the other answers have pointed out (I'm just posting this as an answer because it seemed kind of silly to make it a comment), what you've given in your first code block is <strong>exactly what the contents of your script should be</strong>. You don't need to do anything special to get the <code>r</code> there. In fact the 'r' is not part of the string, it's part of the code that makes the string.</p>
