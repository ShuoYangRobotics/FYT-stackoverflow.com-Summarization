<h3>Question (ID-1602177):</h3><h2>Python compute cluster</h2><p>Would it be possible to make a python cluster, by writing a telnet server, then telnet-ing the commands and output back-and-forth? Has anyone got a better idea for a python compute cluster?
PS. Preferably for python 3.x, if anyone knows how.</p>

You might be especially interested in <a href="http://www.parallelpython.com/" rel="nofollow">Parallel Python</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> There is a new library that is IMHO especially good at clustering: <a href="http://codespeak.net/execnet/" rel="nofollow">execnet</a>. It is small and simple. And it appears to have less bugs than, say, the standard <code>multiprocessing</code> module.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You can see most of the third-party packages available for Python 3 listed <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=browse&amp;c=533&amp;show=all" rel="nofollow">here</a>; relevant to cluster computation is <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mpi4py/1.1.0" rel="nofollow">mpi4py</a> -- most other distributed computing tools such as pyro are still Python-2 only, but MPI is a leading standard for cluster distributed computation and well looking into (I have no direct experience using mpi4py with Python 3, yet, but by hearsay I believe it's a good implementation).</p>

<p>The main alternative is Python's own built-in <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html?highlight=multiprocessing#module-multiprocessing" rel="nofollow">multiprocessing</a>, which also scales up pretty well if you have no interest in interfacing existing nodes that respect the MPI standards but may not be coded in Python.</p>

<p>There is no real added value in rolling your own (as Atwood says, don't reinvent the wheel, unless your purpose is just to better understand wheels!-) -- use one of the solid, tested, widespread solutions, already tested, debugged and optimized on your behalf!-)</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>What kind of stuff do you want to do?  You might want to check out <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/" rel="nofollow">hadoop</a>.  The backend, heavy lifting is done in java, but has a python interface, so you can write python scripts create and send the input, as well as process the results.  </p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Look into these</p>

<p><a href="http://www.parallelpython.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.parallelpython.com/</a></p>

<p><a href="http://pyro.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">http://pyro.sourceforge.net/</a></p>

<p>I have used both and both are exellent for distributed computing<br />
for more detailed list  of options see
<a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/ParallelProcessing" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.python.org/moin/ParallelProcessing</a></p>

<p>and if you want to auto execute something on remote machine , better alternative to telnet is ssh as in <a href="http://pydsh.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">http://pydsh.sourceforge.net/</a></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>"Would it be possible to make a python cluster"</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>I love yes/no questions. Anything else you want to know?</p>

<p>(Note that Python 3 has few third-party libraries yet, so you may wanna stay with Python 2 at the moment.)</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>If you need to write administrative scripts, take a look at the <a href="http://clustershell.sourceforge.net" rel="nofollow">ClusterShell</a> Python library too, or/and its parallel shell <strong>clush</strong>. It's useful when dealing with node sets also (<em>man nodeset</em>).</p>
