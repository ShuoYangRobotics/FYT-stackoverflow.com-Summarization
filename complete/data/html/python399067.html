<h3>Question (ID-399067):</h3><h2>Extended slice that goes to beginning of sequence with negative stride</h2><p>Bear with me while I explain my question.  Skip down to the bold heading if you already understand extended slice list indexing.</p>

<p>In python, you can index lists using slice notation. Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; A = list(range(10))
&gt;&gt;&gt; A[0:5]
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
</code></pre>

<p>You can also include a stride, which acts like a "step":</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; A[0:5:2]
[0, 2, 4]
</code></pre>

<p>The stride is also allowed to be negative, meaning the elements are retrieved in reverse order:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; A[5:0:-1]
[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
</code></pre>

<p>But wait!  I wanted to see <code>[4, 3, 2, 1, 0]</code>.  Oh, I see, I need to decrement the start and end indices:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; A[4:-1:-1]
[]
</code></pre>

<p>What happened?  It's interpreting -1 as  being at the end of the array, not the beginning.  I know you can achieve this as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; A[4::-1]
[4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
</code></pre>

<p>But you can't use this in all cases.  For example, in a method that's been passed indices.  </p>

<h2>My question is:</h2>

<p>Is there any good pythonic way of using extended slices with negative strides <em>and explicit start and end indices</em> that include the first element of a sequence?</p>

<p>This is what I've come up with so far, but it seems unsatisfying.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; A[0:5][::-1]
[4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-9):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Ok, I think this is probably as good as I will get it.  Thanks to Abgan for sparking the idea.  This relies on the fact that None in a slice is treated as if it were a missing parameter.  Anyone got anything better?</p>

<pre><code>def getReversedList(aList, end, start, step):
    return aList[end:start if start!=-1 else None:step]
</code></pre>

<p><em>edit: check for <code>start==-1</code>, not <code>0</code></em></p>

<p>This is still not ideal, because you're clobbering the usual behavior of -1.  It seems the problem here is two overlapping definitions of what's supposed to happen.  Whoever wins takes away otherwise valid invocations looking for the other intention.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><pre><code>[ A[b] for b in range(end,start,stride) ]
</code></pre>

<p>Slower, however you can use negative indices, so this should work:</p>

<pre><code>[ A[b] for b in range(9, -1, -1) ]
</code></pre>

<p>I realize this isn't using slices, but thought I'd offer the solution anyway if using slices specifically for getting the result isn't a priority.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>It is error-prone to change the semantics of <code>start</code> and <code>stop</code>. Use <code>None</code> or <code>-(len(a) + 1)</code> instead of <code>0</code> or <code>-1</code>. The semantics is not arbitrary. See  Edsger W. Dijkstra's article <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD08xx/EWD831.html" rel="nofollow">"Why numbering should start at zero"</a>.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = range(10)
&gt;&gt;&gt; start, stop, step = 4, None, -1
</code></pre>

<p>Or </p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; start, stop, step = 4, -(len(a) + 1), -1
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[start:stop:step]
[4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
</code></pre>

<p>Or</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s = slice(start, stop, step)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[s]
[4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I believe that the following doesn't satisfy you:</p>

<pre><code>def getReversedList(aList, end, start, step):
    if step &lt; 0 and start == 0:
         return aList[end::step]
    return aList[end:start:step]
</code></pre>

<p>or does it? :-)</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>As you say very few people fully understand everything that you can do with extended slicing, so unless you really need the extra performance I'd do it the "obvious" way:</p>

<p><code>
 rev_subset = reversed(data[start:stop])
</code></p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><pre><code>a[4::-1]
</code></pre>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>Python 2.6 (r26:66714, Dec  4 2008, 11:34:15) 
[GCC 4.0.1 (Apple Inc. build 5488)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = list(range(10))
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[4:0:-1]
[4, 3, 2, 1]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[4::-1]
[4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The reason is that the second term is interpreted as "while not index ==".  Leaving it out is "while index in range".</p>

  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/399067/extended-slice-that-goes-to-beginning-of-sequence-with-negative-stride#399082">But</a> you can't use that if you are
  storing your indices in variables for
  example.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is this satisfactory?</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = range(10)
&gt;&gt;&gt; start = 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; end = 4
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[4:start-1 if start &gt; 0 else None:-1]
[4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>I know this is an old question, but in case someone like me is looking for answers:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; A[5-1::-1]
[4, 3, 2, 1, 0]

&gt;&gt;&gt; A[4:1:-1]
[4, 3, 2]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>You can use a <code>slice(start, stop, step)</code> object, which is such that</p>

<pre><code>s=slice(start, stop, step)
print a[s]
</code></pre>

<p>is the same as</p>

<pre><code>print a[start : stop : step]
</code></pre>

<p>and, moreover, you can set any of the arguments to <code>None</code> to indicate nothing in between the colons. So in the case you give, you can use <code>slice(4, None, -1)</code>.</p>
