<h3>Question (ID-4507515):</h3><h2>ValueError: need more than 1 value to unpack</h2><p>Disclaimer: I have read the thread located at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2814128/valueerror-need-more-than-1-value-to-unpack">ValueError: need more than 1 value to unpack</a>, and none of the answers explained how to actually get the code to run.</p>

<p>I am reading Learn Python the Hard Way, and I am on Exercise 13.</p>

<p>Here is the code I am attempting to run in the IDLE thing (don't know what it is really called) for Python 2.7:</p>

<pre><code>from sys import argv

script, first, second, third = argv

print "The script is called:", script
print "Your first variable is:", first
print "Your second variable is:", second
print "Your third variable is:", third
</code></pre>

<p>When run, I get the error:</p>

<p>"Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Python\LPTHW\examples_LPTHW\ex13.py", line 3, in 
    script, first, second, third = argv
ValueError: need more than 1 value to unpack"</p>

<p>I have tried running the program through the Windows command prompt, to no avail. I have also run the program by typing: "python ex13.py first 2nd 3rd", in both the IDLE and the command prompt, also got the same error.</p>

<p>How do I get this code to run, and what the heck am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>EDIT: @John Machin, I made a program exactly like the one you posted, saved it as a .py, then went into the correct directory where my file was saved, ran the program using "python yourcode.py B C D" and I received the following message "python is not recognized as an internal or external command..." When I run the program by just typing it's name (which works for all other programs besides this one) I get an error saying "SyntaxError: invalid syntax on line 2: print len(argv), repr(argv)".</p>

<p>EDIT 2 (With the new code): @John Machin, I copied your program word for word into gedit and made the .py file as usual. I opened my terminal (command prompt) and typed:</p>

<pre><code>python ex13c.py B C D
</code></pre>

<p>And received:</p>

<pre><code>'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file."
</code></pre>

<p>Then I typed:</p>

<pre><code>ex13c.py
</code></pre>

<p>And received:</p>

<pre><code>3.1.3 (r313:86834, Nov 27 2010, 18:30:53) [MSC v.1500 32 bit (Intel)]

    a, b, c, d = argv
ValueError: need more than 1 value to unpack
</code></pre>

<p>Keep in mind I am running W7 64bit, and that Zed is teaching in 2.X and I have been using 2.7 the entire book so far. Every other example has worked. Right before I started Example 11, I installed 3.1 for a different book I am about to start reading. Every time I use the IDLE included with 2.7. Perhaps it is possible I am somehow inadvertently using 3.1 while trying to code in 2.7?</p>

<p>Thanks for bearing with me.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The example works. It seems like you aren't running it correctly.</p>

<p>Firstly, IDLE is a somewhat special environment that I never saw the point of, just run it with the normal Python interpreter.</p>

<p>Secondly, specify the whole path to your python interpreter. Instead of </p>

<pre><code> python ex13c.py B C D
</code></pre>

<p>You on Windows need to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code> "C:\Program Filed\Python-2.7.1\Python.exe" ex13c.py B C D
</code></pre>

<p>Reading exercise 13 I also see that Zed calls modules "features" up until chapter 13. There is no point in doing that, that's just confusing. He also in some chapter tells people to <em>memorize</em> the output of logical tables, which is nonsense. You don't need to memorize them, you need to understand them.</p>

<p>Each time this book pops up in questions here I get less impressed with it. I'm sure there must be a better tutorial. Perhaps Dive into Python?</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Try tunning it like "python test.py foo bar baz"</p>

<p>If it works like that but fails if you call it without specifying the interpreter look here: <a href="http://bugs.python.org/issue7936" rel="nofollow">http://bugs.python.org/issue7936</a></p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Boil your code down to these 4 lines:</p>

<pre><code>from sys import argv
print len(argv), repr(argv)
a, b, c, d = argv
print a, b, c, d
</code></pre>

<p>and run it in a Command Prompt window by typing </p>

<pre><code>python yourcode.py B C D
</code></pre>

<p>Then <strong>copy/paste the exact result</strong> into an edit of your question. Ensure that you show the <code>^</code> produced with any syntax error. Also show the exact code that you ran: <code>type yourcode.py</code></p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> Use this instead:</p>

<pre><code>from sys import argv, version
print(version)
print(len(argv), repr(argv))
a, b, c, d = argv
print(a, b, c, d)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit 2</strong></p>

<p>FIRST TRIAL: You did: <code>python ex13c.py B C D</code> and got nowhere.
Now try: <code>c:\PYTHON\python ex13c.py B C D</code>
(I'm assuming from previous evidence that that's where some version of Python is located)</p>

<p>SECOND TRIAL: You did: <code>ex13c.py</code> with NO ARGUMENTS (why?) and the result was: (1) It appears that .py is associated with a <strong>3.1.3</strong> Python executable somewhere, because it was the last version installed (2) Because you supplied no arguments, len(argv) is 1, and argv contains only the path to your script.</p>

<p>SUGGESTIONS:</p>

<p>You want to have 2.7 and 3.1 on the same machine. This is quite possible (I have 3.1 and 2.1 to 2.7 inclusive because I support software that runs on those versions, and 1.5.2 for nostalgia) with only a mild amount of care. The main things that you need to do are (1) Install Python X.Y in a directory c:\pythonXY (2) run scripts from the commandline like this: <code>\python27\python myscript.py arg1 arg2 etc</code> (3) Don't (as you have done at the moment) put your own scripts and data in a software directory like c:\Python31.</p>

<p>So:
A. Set up new script and data directories for "book1" and "book2". Copy all existing code and data to those new directories. Take a backup.
B. Un-install all versions of Python
C. Install 2.7 and 3.1 to their respective directories.
D. Check that you can run your scripts from their new locations.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p><code>Argv</code> is command line arguments, and it misses values (only has one, the script name). If you want to have <code>None</code> for missing values you can try:</p>

<pre><code>from sys import argv

argv.extend([None, None, None])
script, first, second, third = argv

print "The script is called:", script
print "Your first variable is:", first
print "Your second variable is:", second
print "Your third variable is:", third
</code></pre>

<p>You could also test for number of missing arguments using <code>len(argv)</code> and you can also provide them as suggested in Learn Python The Hard Way:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Run the program like this:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>python ex13.py first 2nd 3rd
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Read farther. Page 36 of Learn Python The Hard Way, Release 1.0 says</p>

<p>What You Should See</p>

<p>Run the program like this:</p>

<p>python ex13.py first 2nd 3rd</p>

<p>ARGV takes from the command line. Run it as above and put in three variables. The script will get the name of the script and then add your three arguments. </p>

<p>[rick@redhat ~]$ python ex1.py 1st 2nd 3rd</p>

<p>The script is called: ex1.py</p>

<p>Your first variable is: 1st</p>

<p>Your second variable is: 2nd</p>

<p>Your third variable is: 3rd</p>

<p>[rick@redhat ~]$ </p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I was having this exact same problem, trying all sorts of silly stuff in the registry and what have you as well. Turned out I was just noobing up the actual command to run the script, as stated above. It's calling for values you have to put in when you go to run it. When you get to <code>ex14.py</code> it would give the same error, unless you use:</p>

<pre><code>python ex14.py (your name)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Dude.  This happened to me.
Very simple fix</p>

<p>You are running your code out of the python software.</p>

<p>All you gotta do is go to all programs > accessories > command prompt</p>

<p>when the command prompt window opens, then you just type "python ex13.py first second third"</p>

<p>if, when you just type "python" by itself and hit return you get an "undefined message" you'll need to follow these <a href="http://docs.python.org/using/windows.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/using/windows.html</a>
to reset python as an executable "path"</p>

<p>i had no idea what "path" meant, basically it's just directing the computer where to go when you type "python"</p>

<p>good luck</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>I found making a simple tweak to the directions above fixed the whole issue: 
1. Open Command Prompt
2. Type in: set path=%path%;C:\python26   (&lt;--I am using 2.6.5, edit accordingly)
3. Type in: python C:/Users/research/Desktop/example.py first second third</p>

<p>For me, the process only worked when the FULL FILE NAME, not just example.py or ex13.py, whatever- was typed in. 
Good luck!    </p>
