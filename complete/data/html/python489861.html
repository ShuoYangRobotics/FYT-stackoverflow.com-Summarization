<h3>Question (ID-489861):</h3><h2>Locking a file in Python</h2><p>I need to lock a file for writing in Python. It will be accessed from multiple Python processes at once. I have found some solutions online, but most fail for my purposes as they are often only Unix based or Windows based.</p>

<p>Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.</p>

<p>Although as Kevin says, writing to a file from multiple processes at once is something you want to avoid if at all possible.</p>

<p>If you can shoehorn your problem into a database, you could use SQLite.  It supports concurrent access and handles its own locking.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Alright, so I ended up going with the code I wrote <a href="http://www.evanfosmark.com/2009/01/cross-platform-file-locking-support-in-python/" rel="nofollow">here, on my website</a>. I can use it in the following fashion:</p>

<pre><code>from filelock import FileLock

with FileLock("myfile.txt"):
    # work with the file as it is now locked
    print("Lock acquired.")
</code></pre>

<p>If anybody sees any problem with this, please let me know.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Coordinating access to a single file at the OS level is fraught with all kinds of issues that you probably don't want to solve.</p>

<p>Your best bet is have a separate process that coordinates read/write access to that file.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>i prefer lockfile â€” Platform-independent file locking <a href="http://packages.python.org/lockfile/lockfile.html">doc here</a></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Locking a file is usually a platform-specific operation, so you may need to allow for the possibility of running on different operating systems. For example:</p>

<pre><code>import os

def my_lock(f):
    if os.name == "posix":
        # Unix or OS X specific locking here
    elif os.name == "nt":
        # Windows specific locking here
    else:
        print "Unknown operating system, lock unavailable"
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Locking is platform and device specific, but generally, you have a few options:</p>

<ol>
<li>use flock(), or equivilent (if your os supports it).  This is advisory locking, unless you check for the lock, its ignored.</li>
<li>Use a lock-copy-move-unlock methodology, where you copy the file, write the new data, then move it (move, not copy - move is an atomic operation), and you check for the existence of the lock file.</li>
<li>Use a directory as a "lock".  This is necessary if you're writing to NFS, since NFS doesn't support flock().</li>
<li>There's also the possibility of using shared memory between the processes, but I've never tried that; its very os-specific.</li>
</ol>

<p>For all these methods, you'll have to use a spin-lock (retry-after-failure) technique for acquiring and testing the lock.  This does leave a small window for mis-synchronization, but its generally small enough to not be an major issue.</p>

<p>If you're looking for a solution that is cross platform, then you're better off logging to another system via some other mechanism (the next best thing is the NFS technique above).  </p>

<p>Note that sqlite is subject to the same constraints over NFS that normal files are, so you can't write to an sqlite database on a network share and get synchronization for free.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Kernel-level file locking is an extremly complex subject, since different types of locks have very different semantic, and the main lock of unix systems (fcntl) has horrible flaws.</p>

<p>But I've just released a python library which deals with the issue in a very portable way. It can achieve shared/exclusive file record locking in a system-wide manner, and provides workaround for fcntl flaws.</p>
