<h3>Question (ID-133860):</h3><h2>Running subversion under apache and mod_python</h2><p>My Apache server runs on some non-default (not-root) account. When it tries to run a python script which in turn executes a subversion check-out command, 'svn checkout' fails with the following error message:</p>

<pre><code>svn: Can't open file '/root/.subversion/servers': Permission denied
</code></pre>

<p>At the same time running that python script with subversion checkout command inside from command line under the same user account goes on perfectly well.</p>

<p>Apache server 2.2.6 with mod_python 3.2.8 runs on Fedora Core 6 machine.</p>

<p>Can anybody help me out? Thanks a lot.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>It sounds like the environment you apache process is running under is a little unusual.  For whatever reason, svn seems to think the user configuration files it needs are in /root.  You can avoid having svn use the root versions of the files by specifying on the command line which config directory to use, like so:</p>

<pre><code>svn --config-dir /home/myuser/.subversion checkout http://example.com/path
</code></pre>

<p>While not fixing your enviornment, it will at least allow you to have your script run properly...</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Try granting the Apache user (the user that the apache service is running under) r+w permissions on that file.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Doesn't Apache's error log give you a clue?</p>

<p>Maybe it has to do with SELinux. Check /var/log/audit/audit.log and adjust your SELinux configuration accordingly, if the audit.log file indicates that it's SELinux which denies Apache access.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The Permission Denied error is showing that the script is running with root credentials, because it's looking in root's home dir for files.</p>

<p>I suggest you change the hook script to something that does:</p>

<pre><code>id &gt; /tmp/id
</code></pre>

<p>so that you can check the results of that to make sure what the uid/gid and euid/egid are.  You will probably find it's not actually running as the user you think it is.</p>

<p>My first guess, like Troels, was also SELinux, but that would only be my guess if you are absolutely sure the script through Apache is running with exactly the same user/group as your manual test.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Well, thanks to all who answered the question. Anyway, I think I solved the mistery. </p>

<p>SELinux is completely disabled on the machine, so the problem is definitely in 'svn co' not being able to found config_dir for the user account it runs under.</p>

<p>Apache / mod_python doesn't read in shell environment of the user account which apache is running  on. Thus for examle no $HOME is seen by mod_python when apache 
is running under some  real user ( not nobody ) </p>

<p>Now 'svn co' has a flag --config-dir which points to configuration directory to read params from. By default it is $HOME/.subversion, i.e. it corresponds to the user account home directory. Apparently when no $HOME exists mod_python goes to root home dir ( /root) and tries to fiddle with .subversion content over there - which is obviously
fails miserably.</p>

<p>putting </p>

<p>SetEnv HOME /home/qa </p>

<p>into the /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf doesn't solve the problem because of SetEnv having nothing to do with shell environment - it only sets apache related environment</p>

<p>Likewise PythonOption - sets only mod_python related variables which can be read with req.get_options()  after that</p>

<p>Running 'svn co --config-dir /home/ ...' definitely gives a workaround for running from within mod_python, but gets in the way of those who will try to run the script from command line.</p>

<p>So the proposed ( and working) solution is to set HOME environment variable prior to starting appache.</p>

<p>For example in /etc/init.d/httpd  script </p>

<pre><code>    QAHOME=/home/qa
    ...
    HOME=$QAHOME LANG=$HTTPD_LANG daemon $httpd $OPTIONS
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>What is happening is apache is being started with the environment variables of root, so it thinks that it should find its config files in /root/. This is NOT the case.
what happens is if you do sudo apache2ctl start, it pulls your $HOME variable from the sudo $HOME=/root/</p>

<p>I have just found a solution to this problem myself (although with mod_perl, but same thing)</p>

<p>run this command (if its apache 1, remove the 2):</p>

<pre><code>sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 stop
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start
</code></pre>

<p>When /etc/init.d/apache2 starts apache, it sets all the proper environment variables that apache should be running under.</p>
