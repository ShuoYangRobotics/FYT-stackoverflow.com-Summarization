<h3>Question (ID-1211463):</h3><h2>Simple non-web based bug tracker</h2><p>There's a ton and and a half of questions and even more answers here concerning people looking for bug trackers. However all of them (that I found) seem to be about web based solutions. Since I'm working on a local project where I don't want to set up a web / DB server, and I don't want to use a hosted tracker either, I'm looking for something that runs locally.</p>

<ul>
<li>very preferably open-source</li>
<li>pure Python or (at least) Windows executable</li>
<li>no need for a database server (sqlite is obviously fine)</li>
<li>Doesn't have to be fancy, just the basic bug / issue tracking functionality; just a little bit more than my current TODO text file or an Excel table.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>It's:</p>

<ul>
<li>opensource.</li>
<li>pure Python</li>
<li>uses sqlite</li>
</ul>

<p>But as I said, might be too complex for your use case.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>If you don't need to share your bug tracker system with a team (i.e., it's okay to have it isolated to your computer) I would recommend using <a href="http://www.tiddlywiki.com/" rel="nofollow">Tiddlywiki</a>.  Technically it's web-based, but it's entirely encapsulated within a single HTML document and requires no database or server whatsoever (only a web browser) so I think it follows the spirit of what you are wanting.  It's extremely customizable since it's 100% HTML/CSS/javascript.  I have been using a tiddlywiki as a project notebook for years, keeping track of my to-do list, bug list, and general project documentation in one centralized, cross-referenced place.  You can also find all sorts of tiddlywikis that you can download pre-configured for productivity (for example, <a href="http://www.getteamtasks.com/" rel="nofollow">TeamTasks</a>, <a href="http://monkeygtd.tiddlyspot.com/" rel="nofollow">MonkeyGTD</a>, or <a href="http://www.checkettsweb.com/tw/gtd_tiddlywiki.htm" rel="nofollow">GTDTiddlyWiki Plus</a>).</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I'm surprised nobody has mentioned <a href="http://roundup.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">Roundup</a>.</p>

<p>It meets all your criteria, including not requiring a web-based interface (as per your specification, and unlike the accepted answer which suggested Trac).</p>

<p>Roundup is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open source</li>
<li>Pure Python</li>
<li>Supports SQLite</li>
<li>Not fancy, focuses on solid bug tracking</li>
</ul>

<p>And as a significant point of differentiation, it has command-line and email interfaces in addition to a web interface.</p>

<p>It's very easy to get started - I suggest you take it for a spin.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Maybe <a href="http://www.fossil-scm.org/" rel="nofollow">Fossil</a> is of any use to you?</p>

<p>It is actually a DVCS but it also integrates a bugtracker and wiki, very much like trac (although I like trac, don't get me wrong). And its webbased, on the other hand the installation is supossedly dead simple.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Proprietary TestTrack (<a href="http://www.seapine.com/ttpro.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.seapine.com/ttpro.html</a>) has a client edition that will those things. We use it at work and I'm very happy using it.</p>

<p>Maybe you can check out this wikipedia article for hints

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Do yourself a favor. Get over this "must not be web based" obsession, Install a local WAMP stack on your PC or on a LAN server. Now, you can install your own <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/wikipedia/geek-to-live-set-up-your-personal-wikipedia-163707.php" rel="nofollow">wiki</a>. And something like Trac. I'd like to find an implementation of google code's bugtracker and integrated wiki thats runnable locally - <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracDownload" rel="nofollow">Trac</a> seems to be the closest.</p>

<p>You have also installed a local SVN server? Even for personal projects the ability to track changes over time. revert etc. and integration with Trac are too good to pass up even for purely 1 man projects.</p>
