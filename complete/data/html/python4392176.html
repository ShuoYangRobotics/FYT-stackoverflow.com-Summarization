<h3>Question (ID-4392176):</h3><h2>Escape for str in Python</h2><p>Wow, this should be so simple, but it' just not working.
I need to inset a "\" into a string (for a Bash command), but escaping just doesn't work.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 'testing'
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = a[:3] + '\' + a[3:]
    &gt;&gt;&gt; File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1
    &gt;&gt;&gt; b = a[:3] + '\' + a[3:]
                              ^
   &gt;&gt;&gt;SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = a[:3] + '\\' + a[3:]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b
'tes\\ting'
&gt;&gt;&gt; sys.version
'2.7 (r27:82500, Sep 16 2010, 18:02:00) \n[GCC 4.5.1 20100907 (Red Hat 4.5.1-3)]' 
</code></pre>

<p>The first error is understandable and expexted. The end quote is being eaten, and the interpreter barfs. 
However, the second example should work. Why is there two slashes?</p>

<p>Python 2.7</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Edit: Thanks Greg. It was a problem with working at the interpreter and not using repr(b). Python was working correctly, but I wasn't looking at the correct version of the output.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You are being misled by Python's output. Try:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = "test\\ing"
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(a)
test\ing
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(repr(a))
'test\\ing'
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
'test\\ing'
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You can do a couple of things.  The first is to escape the backslash with another backslash, so:</p>

<pre><code>a = 'test\\ing'
</code></pre>

<p>You can also declare it as a Raw String like this:</p>

<pre><code>a = r'test\ing'
</code></pre>

<p>And you should end up with the back slash.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If you want double slashes because the shell will escape \ again, use a raw string:</p>

<pre><code>b = a[:3] + r'\\' + a[3:]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p><code>'tes\\ting'</code> is correct, but you are viewing the <code>repr</code> output for the string, which will always show escape characters.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print 'tes\\ting'
tes\ting
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>The second example is correct. There are two slashes because you are printing the <em>Python representation</em> of the string.</p>

<p>If you want to see the actual string, call <code>print a</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>b is fine in the second example, you see two slashes because you're printing the representation of b, so slashes are escaped in it too.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; b
'tes\\ting'
&gt;&gt;&gt; print b
tes\ting
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Python's quoting the backslash again when it shows you the representation of the string (in such a way that you could paste it in and get the string with an escaped backslash).</p>

<p>If you print the string, you'll see there's only one.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>print "hello\world"
      hello\world</p>
