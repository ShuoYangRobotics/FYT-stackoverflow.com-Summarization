<h3>Question (ID-1089307):</h3><h2>Financial Charts / Graphs in Ruby or Python</h2><p>What are my best options for creating a financial open-high-low-close (OHLC) chart in a high level language like Ruby or Python? While there seem to be a lot of options for graphing, I haven't seen any gems or eggs with this kind of chart.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-high-low-close_chart" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-high-low-close_chart</a> (but I don't need the moving average or Bollinger bands)</p>

<p>JFreeChart can do this in Java, but I'd like to make my codebase as small and simple as possible.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-9):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You can use <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">matplotlib</a> and the the optional <code>bottom</code> parameter of <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.bar" rel="nofollow">matplotlib.pyplot.bar</a>. You can then use line <code>plot</code> to indicate the opening and closing prices:</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib import lines

import random


deltas = [4, 6, 13, 18, 15, 14, 10, 13, 9, 6, 15, 9, 6, 1, 1, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 10, 11, 16, 17, 12, 10, 12, 15, 17, 16, 11, 10, 9, 9, 7, 10, 7, 16, 8, 12, 10, 14, 10, 15, 15, 16, 12, 8, 15, 16]
bases = [46, 49, 45, 45, 44, 49, 51, 52, 56, 58, 53, 57, 62, 63, 68, 66, 65, 66, 63, 63, 62, 61, 61, 57, 61, 64, 63, 58, 56, 56, 56, 60, 59, 54, 57, 54, 54, 50, 53, 51, 48, 43, 42, 38, 37, 39, 44, 49, 47, 43]


def rand_pt(bases, deltas):
    return [random.randint(base, base + delta) for base, delta in zip(bases, deltas)]

# randomly assign opening and closing prices 
openings = rand_pt(bases, deltas)
closings = rand_pt(bases, deltas)

# First we draw the bars which show the high and low prices
# bottom holds the low price while deltas holds the difference 
# between high and low.
width = 0
ax = plt.axes()
rects1 = ax.bar(np.arange(50), deltas, width, color='r', bottom=bases)

# Now draw the ticks indicating the opening and closing price
for opening, closing, bar in zip(openings, closings, rects1):
    x, w = bar.get_x(), 0.2

    args = {
    }

    ax.plot((x - w, x), (opening, opening), **args)
    ax.plot((x, x + w), (closing, closing), **args)


plt.show()
</code></pre>

<p>creates a plot like this:</p>

<p>Obviously, you'd want to package this up in a function that drew the plot using <code>(open, close, min, max)</code> tuples (and you probably wouldn't want to randomly assign your opening and closing prices).</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You can use Pylab (<code>matplotlib.finance</code>) with Python.  Here are some examples: <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/examples/pylab%5Fexamples/plotfile%5Fdemo.html" rel="nofollow">http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/examples/pylab_examples/plotfile_demo.html</a> .  There is some good material specifically on this problem in <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1430218436" rel="nofollow">Beginning Python Visualization</a>.</p>

<p>Update:  I think you can use <a href="http://doc.astro-wise.org/matplotlib.finance.html" rel="nofollow">matplotlib.finance.candlestick</a> for the Japanese candlestick effect.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Have you considered using R and the <a href="http://www.quantmod.com/" rel="nofollow">quantmod</a> package?  It likely provides exactly what you need.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Are you free to use JRuby instead of Ruby?  That'd let you use JFreeChart, plus your code would still be in Ruby</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Some good examples about financial plots (OHLC) using matplotlib can be found here:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/examples/pylab_examples/finance_demo.html" rel="nofollow">finance demo</a></li>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Please look at the Open Flash Chart embedding for WHIFF
<a href="http://aaron.oirt.rutgers.edu/myapp/docs/W1100%5F1600.openFlashCharts" rel="nofollow">http://aaron.oirt.rutgers.edu/myapp/docs/W1100_1600.openFlashCharts</a>
An example of a candle chart is right at the top.  This would be especially
good for embedding in web pages.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Open Flash Chart is nice choice if you like the look of examples. I've moved to JavaScript/Canvas library like <a href="http://code.google.com/p/flot/" rel="nofollow">Flot</a> for HTML embedded charts, as it is more customizable and I get desired effect  without much hacking (http://itprolife.worona.eu/2009/08/scatter-chart-library-moving-to-flot.html).</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>This is the stock chart I draw just days ago using Matplotlib, I've posted the source too, for your reference: <a href="http://bluegene8210.is-programmer.com/posts/25954.html" rel="nofollow">StockChart_Matplotlib</a></p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>you can use <a href="http://www.java4less.com/chartsruby/chart.php" rel="nofollow">RChart for Ruby</a>, it supports the kind of charts you refer to</p>
