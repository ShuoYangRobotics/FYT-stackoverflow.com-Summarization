<h3>Question (ID-1946181):</h3><h2>How can I control the keyboard and mouse with Python?</h2><p>How can I control the mouse and keyboard in Python?</p>

<p>The idea is to do the same as the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/awt/Robot.html" rel="nofollow">Robot() class</a> in Java. Be able to say: move the mouse from here to here, click there, write that whatever is on the screen.</p>

<p>For Windows there is win32api but I'm using mainly Linux.</p>

<p>For Linux there is Xlib but does it works for keyboard as well? (found only reference to the mouse)</p>

<p>Is there a cross-platform solution? (Linux, Windows and even OS X would be the great.)</p>

<p>see the gedit example, <a href="https://fedorahosted.org/dogtail/browser/examples/gedit-test-utf8-procedural-api.py" rel="nofollow">https://fedorahosted.org/dogtail/browser/examples/gedit-test-utf8-procedural-api.py</a></p>

<p>So just use dogtail e.g</p>

<pre><code>dogtail.rawinput.click(100, 100)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Here is an interessting Thread from Python Forum for you:
<a href="http://www.python-forum.org/pythonforum/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=8976" rel="nofollow">Python Forum</a></p>

<p>Edit:
There was also an interessting question on stackoverflow regarding mouse control...maybe it is a good starting point..
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1181464/controlling-mouse-with-python">Mouse Control with Python</a></p>

<p>One of the Answers is refering to an Linux example...which heads you to an nice blog entry.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>for the mouse, I've found <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pymouse/" rel="nofollow">pymouse</a> which seems to work (I haven't fully tried it, a small hack needed for the click, cf the issues)</p>

<p>for the keyboard, I'm not sure Xlib can do the job. I'm still looking on how to write something but you can catch key event as explained <a href="http://www.larsen-b.com/Article/184.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> or in C <a href="http://danielbaggio.blogspot.com/2008/04/generating-keypresses-on-linux.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> using Xlib (but I don't know C).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.python-forum.org/pythonforum/viewtopic.php?p=43596#p43596" rel="nofollow">here</a> is an example working on gnome only (not good enough yet)</p>

<p>In pymouse, they have a nice way to make it work on the 3 different platform but needs to make 3 code...</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>For console try ncurses or slang. In other situation try PyQt, PyGtk, TkInter.</p>

<p>ALL of this solution ARE cross-platform and work almost anywhere. </p>

<p>Yes, it work for keyboard also.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>This totally works... on a Mac at least.  This is for a click AND drag, etc.. but can be retrofitted accordingly.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python
import sys
import time
from Quartz.CoreGraphics import * # imports all of the top-level symbols in the module

def mouseEvent(type, posx, posy):
    theEvent = CGEventCreateMouseEvent(None, type, (posx,posy), kCGMouseButtonLeft)
    CGEventPost(kCGHIDEventTap, theEvent)
def mousemove(posx,posy):
    mouseEvent(kCGEventMouseMoved, posx,posy);
def mouseclickdn(posx,posy):
    mouseEvent(kCGEventLeftMouseDown, posx,posy);
def mouseclickup(posx,posy):
    mouseEvent(kCGEventLeftMouseUp, posx,posy);
def mousedrag(posx,posy):
    mouseEvent(kCGEventLeftMouseDragged, posx,posy);

ourEvent = CGEventCreate(None);
currentpos=CGEventGetLocation(ourEvent); # Save current mouse position
mouseclickdn(60, 100);
mousedrag(60, 300);
mouseclickup(60, 300);
time.sleep(1);
mousemove(int(currentpos.x),int(currentpos.y)); # Restore mouse position
