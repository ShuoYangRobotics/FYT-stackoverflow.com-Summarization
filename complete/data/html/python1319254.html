<h3>Question (ID-1319254):</h3><h2>What is the most efficient way to add an element to a list only if isn't there yet?</h2><p>I have the following code in Python:</p>

<pre><code>def point_to_index(point):
    if point not in points:
        points.append(point)
    return points.index(point)
</code></pre>

<p>This code is awfully inefficient, especially since I expect <code>points</code> to grow to hold a few million elements.</p>

<p>If the point isn't in the list, I traverse the list 3 times:</p>

<ol>
<li>look for it and decide it isn't there</li>
<li>go to the end of the list and add a new element</li>
<li>go to the end of the list until I find the index</li>
</ol>

<p>If it <em>is</em> in the list, I traverse it twice:
1. look for it and decide it is there
2. go almost to the end of the list until I find the index</p>

<p>Is there any more efficient way to do this?  For instance, I know that:</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm more likely to call this function with a point that isn't in the list.</li>
<li>If the point is in the list, it's likelier to be near the end than in the beginning.</li>
</ul>

<p>So if I could have the line:</p>

<pre><code>if point not in points:
</code></pre>

<p>search the list from the end to the beginning it would improve performance when the point is already in the list.</p>

<p>However, I don't want to do:</p>

<pre><code>if point not in reversed(points):
</code></pre>

<p>because I imagine that <code>reversed(points)</code> itself will come at a huge cost.</p>

<p>Nor do I want to add new points to the beginning of the list (assuming I knew how to do that in Python) because that would change the indices, which must remain constant for the algorithm to work.</p>

<p>The only improvement I can think of is to implement the function with only one pass, if possible from the end to the beginning.  The bottom line is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is there a good way to do this?</li>
<li>Is there a better way to optimize the function?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I've gotten suggestions for implementing this with only one pass.  Is there any way for <code>index()</code> to go from the end to the beginning?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> People have asked why the index is critical.  I'm trying to describe a 3D surface using the <a href="http://shape.cs.princeton.edu/benchmark/documentation/off%5Fformat.html" rel="nofollow">OFF file format</a>.  This format describes a surface using its vertices and faces.  First the vertices are listed, and the faces are described using a list of indices of vertices.  That's why once I add a vortex to the list, its index must not change.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> There have been some suggestions (such as <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1319254/what-is-the-most-efficient-way-to-add-an-element-to-a-list-only-if-isnt-there-ye/1319470#1319470">igor's</a>) to use a dict.  This is a good solution for <em>scanning</em> the list.  However, when I'm done I need to print out the list in the same order it was created.  If I use a dict, I need to print out its keys sorted by value.  Is there a good way to do that?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I implemented <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/55225/www-brool-com">www.brool.com</a>'s <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1319254/what-is-the-most-efficient-way-to-add-an-element-to-a-list-only-if-isnt-there-ye/1321039#1321039">suggestion</a>.  This was the simplest and fastest.  It is essentially an ordered Dict, but without the overhead.  The performance is great!</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>This will traverse at most once:</p>

<pre><code>def point_to_index(point):
    try: 
        return points.index(point)
    except ValueError:
        points.append(point)
        return len(points)-1
</code></pre>

<p>You may also want to try this version, which takes into account that matches are likely to be near the end of the list.  Note that <code>reversed()</code> has almost no cost even on very large lists - it does not create a copy and does not traverse the list more than once.</p>

<pre><code>def point_to_index(point):
    for index, this_point in enumerate(reversed(points)):
        if point == this_point:
            return len(points) - (index+1)
    else:
        points.append(point)
        return len(points)-1
</code></pre>

<p>You might also consider keeping a parallel <code>dict</code> or <code>set</code> of points to check for membership, since both of those types can do membership tests in O(1).  There would be, of course, a substantial memory cost.</p>

<p>Obviously, if the points were ordered somehow, you would have many other options for speeding this code up, notably using a binary search for membership tests.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You want to use a <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#set" rel="nofollow">set</a>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = set()
&gt;&gt;&gt; x
set([])
&gt;&gt;&gt; x.add(1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; x
set([1])
&gt;&gt;&gt; x.add(1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; x
set([1])
</code></pre>

<p>A set contains only one instance of any item you add, and it will be a lot more efficient than iterating a list manually.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python%5FProgramming/Sets" rel="nofollow">This wikibooks page</a> looks like a good primer if you haven't used sets in Python before.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If you're worried about memory usage, but want to optimize the common case, keep a dictionary with the last n points and their indexes. points_dict = dictionary, max_cache = size of the cache.</p>

<pre><code>def point_to_index(point):
    try:
        return points_dict.get(point, points.index(point))
    except:
        if len(points) &gt;= max_cache:
            del points_dict[points[len(points)-max_cache]]
        points.append(point)
        points_dict[points] = len(points)-1
        return len(points)-1
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><pre><code>def point_to_index(point):
    try:
        return points.index(point)
    except:
        points.append(point)
        return len(points)-1
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Added in Nathan's exception code.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>As others said, consider using set or dict. You don't explain why you need the indices. If they are needed only to assign unique ids to the points (and I can't easily come up with another reason for using them), then dict will indeed work much better, e.g.,</p>

<pre><code>points = {}
def point_to_index(point):
    if point in points:
        return points[point]
    else:
       points[point] = len(points)
       return len(points) - 1
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>What you really want is an ordered dict (key insertion determines the order):</p>
