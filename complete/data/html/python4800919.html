<h3>Question (ID-4800919):</h3><h2>Which are good hands-on ("learn-by-doing") books about Python?</h2><p>Are there books like <em>Learning Python the Hard Way</em> where you have to write out code along the book?<br>
I find a lot of books just 'talk at you'. The Head First series of books are supposed to be good at this but I didn't like their Python series. </p>

<p>Recommendations anyone?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> 
I have zero programming background. Been messing around with Python last couple of weeks.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>There are tons of (free) resources for learning Python. The Python docs provides a tutorial. You may want to try this: <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/static/LearnPythonTheHardWay.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://learnpythonthehardway.org/static/LearnPythonTheHardWay.pdf</a></p>

<p>Learning a new language is often like writing...you just need to start typing </p>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I really like ""Core Python Programming" by Wesley Chun.  Lots of exercises.</p>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You can also start on <a href="http://trypython.org" rel="nofollow">trypython.org</a>, a website. It starts from the basics and might be what you are looking for.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>try <a href="http://www.zacharski.org/books/python-for-linguists/" rel="nofollow">http://www.zacharski.org/books/python-for-linguists/</a>
it's focusing on analysing texts but the examples are really clear</p>
