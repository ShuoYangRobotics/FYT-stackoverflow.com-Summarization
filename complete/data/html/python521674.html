<h3>Question (ID-521674):</h3><h2>Initializing a list to a known number of elements in Python</h2><p>Right now I am using a list, and was expecting something like:</p>

<pre><code>verts = list (1000)
</code></pre>

<p>Should I use array instead?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The first thing that comes to mind for me is:</p>

<pre><code>verts = [None]*1000
</code></pre>

<p>But do you really need to preinitialize it?</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Not quite sure why everyone is giving you a hard time for wanting to do this - there are several scenarios where you'd want a fixed size initialised list. And you've correctly deduced that arrays are sensible in these cases.</p>

<pre><code>import array
verts=array.array('i',(0,)*1000)
</code></pre>

<p>For the non-pythonistas, the <code>(0,)*1000</code> term is creating a tuple containing 1000 zeros. The comma forces python to recognise <code>(0)</code> as a tuple, otherwise it would be evaluated as 0.</p>

<p>I've used a tuple instead of a list because they are generally have lower overhead.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>One obvious and probably not efficient way is </p>

<pre><code>verts = [0 for x in range(1000)]
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this can be extended to 2-dimension easily. 
For example, to get a 10x100 "array" you can do </p>

<pre><code>verts = [[0 for x in range(100)] for y in range(10)]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You should consider using a <code>dict</code> type instead of pre-initialized list. The cost of a dictionary look-up is small and comparable to the cost of accessing arbitrary list element.</p>

<p>And when using a mapping you can write:</p>

<pre><code>aDict = {}
aDict[100] = fetchElement()
putElement(fetchElement(), fetchPosition(), aDict)
</code></pre>

<p>And the <code>putElement</code> function can store item at any given position. And if you need to check if your collection contains element at given index it is more Pythonic to write:</p>

<pre><code>if anIndex in aDict:
    print "cool!"
</code></pre>

<p>Than:  </p>

<pre><code>if not myList[anIndex] is None:
    print "cool!"
</code></pre>

<p>Since the latter assumes that no <em>real</em> element in your collection can be <code>None</code>. And if that happens - your code misbehaves.</p>

<p>And if you desperately need performance and that's why you try to pre-initialize your variables, and write the fastest code possible - change your language. The fastest code can't be written in Python. You should try C instead and implement wrappers to call your pre-initialized and pre-compiled code from Python.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Without knowing more about the problem domain, it's hard to answer your question.
Unless you are certain that you need to do something more, the pythonic way to initialize a list is:</p>

<pre>
verts = []
</pre>

<p>Are you actually seeing a performance problem?  If so, what is the performance bottleneck?
Don't try to solve a problem that you don't have.   It's likely that performance cost to dynamically fill an array to 1000 elements is <i>completely irrelevant</i> to the program  that you're really trying to write.</p>

<p>The array class is useful if the things in your list are always going to be a specific primitive fixed-length type (e.g. char, int, float).  But, it doesn't require pre-initialization either.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You could do this:</p>

<pre><code>verts = list(xrange(1000))</code></pre>

<p>That would give you a list of 1000 elements in size and which happens to be initialised with values from 0-999.  As <code>list</code> does a <code>__len__</code> first to size the new list it should be fairly efficient. </p>
