<h3>Question (ID-1342377):</h3><h2>Can you really use the Visual Studio 2008 IDE to code in Python?</h2><p>I have a friend who I am trying to teach how to program. He comes from a very basic PHP background, and for some reason is ANTI C#, I guess because some of his PHP circles condemn anything that comes from Microsoft.</p>

<p>Anyways - I've told him its possible to use either Ruby or Python with the VS2008 IDE, because I've read somewhere that this is possible. </p>

<p>But I was wondering. Is it really that practical, can you do EVERYTHING with Python in VS2008 that you can do with C# or VB.net. </p>

<p>I guess without starting a debate... I want to know if you're a developer using VS IDE with a language other than VB.net or C#, then please leave an answer with your experience. </p>

<p>If you are (like me) either a VB.net or C# developer, please don't post speculative or subjective answers. This is a serious question, and I don't want it being closed as subjective. ...</p>

<p>Thank you very much.</p>

<p><strong>update</strong></p>

<p>So far we've established that IronPython is the right tool for the job. </p>

<p>Now how practical is it really?</p>

<p>Mono for example runs C# code in Linux, but... ever tried to use it? Not practical at all, lots of code refactoring needs to take place, no support for .net v3.5, etc...</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://pythonnet.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">Python.NET</a> (extension to vanilla Python that adds .NET support)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=IronPython" rel="nofollow">IronPython</a> (re-implementation of Python as a .NET language)</li>
<li><a href="http://boo.codehaus.org/" rel="nofollow">Boo</a> (Python-like language that compiles down to C#-equivalent MSIL code)</li>
</ul>

<p>Using Python in Visual Studio without using the CLR seems like a bit of a waste to me.  Eclipse with PyDev would be a much better choice.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I find it odd that your friend is against C# but is ok with Visual Studio.  There is, after all, an open source development environment for .NET called SharpDevelop.  The C# language is a standard.  .NET is free (as in beer) and there is an open source implementation of that platform called Mono.  The only "un-free" thing is Visual Studio (though there are "Express" versions which are free as in beer).</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I don't know why you would want to - perhaps something like <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/IronPythonStudio" rel="nofollow">IronPython Studio</a> would be a happy medium.  But as I said I don't know why you would want to use Visual Studio for Python development when there are <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments" rel="nofollow">much better options available.</a></p>

<p>Always choose the right tool for the right job - just because you can drive a nail with the butt-end of your cordless drill doesn't mean that you should.  Visual Studio was not designed for Python development and as such will not be a perfect environment for developing in it.  Please use the list I have linked to choose a more appropriate editor from that list.</p>

<p>As a side note, I am wondering why your PHP friend refuses to use C# (a free, industry standardized language) but is okay using Visual Studio (an expensive, closed-source integrated development environment).</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>This has been discussed before <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/537689/python-ide-built-into-visual-studio-2008">in this thread.</a> I personally prefer eclipse and pyDev.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Firstly, there seems to be a question as to whether python (or various implementations) are as 'powerful' as C#. I'm not quite sure what to take powerful to mean, but in my experience of both languages it will be somewhat easier and faster to write a given piece of code in python than in C#. C# is faster than cpython (although if speed is desired, the psyco python module is well worth a look).</p>

<p>Also I would object to your dismissal of Mono. Mono is great on Linux <em>if you write an application for it from scratch.</em> It is not really meant to be a compatibility layer between Windows and Linux (see Wine!), and if you treat it as such you will only be disappointed.</p>

<p>It just seems to me that you are taking the wrong approach. If you want to convince him that not everything Microsoft is evil, and he is adamant about not learning C#, get him to learn Python (or Ruby, or LUA or whatever) until he is competent, and then introduce him to C# and get him to make his own judgement - I'm fairly in favour of open source, and am far from a rabid Microsoft supporter, but I tried C#, and found I quite liked it.</p>

<p>I think that getting him to use python and visual studio in a suboptimal way will turn him against both of them - far from your desired goal!</p>
