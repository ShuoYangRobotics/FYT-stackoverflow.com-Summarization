<h3>Question (ID-699177):</h3><h2>Python: Do Python Lists keep a count for len() or does it count for each call?</h2><p>If I keep calling len() on a very long list, am I wasting time, or does it keep an int count in the background?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Don't worry: Of course it saves the count and thus <code>len()</code> on lists is a pretty cheap operation. Same is true for strings, dictionaries and sets, by the way!</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>And one more way to find out how it's done is <a href="http://www.google.com/codesearch/p?hl=en#ggVSD6_h0Ho/Python-2.5/Objects/listobject.c&amp;q=package:python-2.5%20listobject.c%20lang:c&amp;l=370" rel="nofollow">to look it up on Google Code Search</a>, if you don't want to download the source yourself.</p>

<pre><code>static Py_ssize_t list_length(PyListObject *a)
{
    return a-&gt;ob_size;
}
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Write your program so that it's <strong>optimised for clarity and easily maintainable</strong>. Is your program clearer with a call to ‘len(foo)’? Then do that.</p>

<p>Are you worried about the time taken? Use the ‘timeit’ module in the standard library to <em>measure</em> the time taken, and see whether it is significant in your code.</p>

<p>You will, like most people, very likely be wrong in your guesses about which parts of your program are slowest.</p>

<p>Remember that <strong>premature optimisation is the root of all evil</strong>, in the words of Donald Knuth. Only focus on the speed of code that you have <em>measured</em> the speed of, to know whether it's worth the cost of changing how it works.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=JnR9hQA3SncC&amp;pg=PA478&amp;dq=Python%2Blen%2Bbig%2BO&amp;ei=JUbRSYPqGofqkwTy9%5FihAQ" rel="nofollow"><code>len</code> is an O(1) operation</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>A Python "list" is really a resizeable array, not a linked list, so it stores the size somewhere.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>The question has been answered (<code>len</code> is O(1)), but here's how you can check for yourself:</p>

<pre><code>$ python -m timeit -s "l = range(10)" "len(l)"
10000000 loops, best of 3: 0.119 usec per loop
$ python -m timeit -s "l = range(1000000)" "len(l)"
10000000 loops, best of 3: 0.131 usec per loop
</code></pre>

<p>Yep, not really slower.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>It has to store the length somewhere, so you aren't counting the number of items every time.</p>
