<h3>Question (ID-3503970):</h3><h2>Make Python ignore .pyc files</h2><p>Is there a way to make Python ignore any .pyc files that are present and always interpret all the code (including imported modules) directly?  Google hasn't turned up any answers, so I suspect not, but it seemed worth asking just in case.</p>

<p>(Why do I want to do this? I have a large pipeline of Python scripts which are run repeatedly over a cluster of a couple hundred computers. The Python scripts themselves live on a shared NFS filesystem.  Somehow, rarely, after having been run hundreds of times over several hours, they will suddenly start crashing with an error about not being able to import a module.  Forcing the regeneration of the .pyc file fixes the problem.  I want, of course, to fix the underlying causes, but in the meantime we also need the system to continue running, so it seems like ignoring the .pyc files if possible would be a reasonable workaround).</p>

<p>P.S. I'm using Python 2.5, so I can't use -B.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>It's not exactly what you asked for, but would removing the existing .pyc files and then not creating any more work for you? In that case, you could use the -B option:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;python --help
usage: python [option] ... [-c cmd | -m mod | file | -] [arg] ...
Options and arguments (and corresponding environment variables):
-B     : don't write .py[co] files on import; also PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=x
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You <em>could</em> use the standard Python library's imp module to reimplement <code>__builtins__.__import__</code>, which is the hook function called by <code>import</code> and <code>from</code> statement.  In particular, the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/imp.html#imp.load_module" rel="nofollow">imp.load_module</a> function can be used to load a <code>.py</code> even when the corresponding <code>.pyc</code> is present.  Be sure to study carefully all the docs in the page I've pointed to, plus those for <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html?highlight=__import__#__import__" rel="nofollow"><strong>import</strong></a>, as it's kind of a delicate job.  The docs themselves suggest using import hooks instead (per PEP 302) but for this particular task I suspect that would be even harder.</p>

<p>BTW, likely causes for your observed problems include race conditions between different computers trying to write <code>.pyc</code> files at the same time -- NFS locking is notoriously flaky and has always been;-).  As long as every Python compiler you're using is at the same version (if not, you're in big trouble anyway;-), I'd rather precompile all of those <code>.py</code> files into <code>.pyc</code> and make their directories read-only; the latter seems the simplest approach anyway (rather than hacking <code>__import__</code>), even if for some reason you can't precompile.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Can you make the script directories read/execute-only so that the .pyc files can't be created?</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Perhaps you could work around this by, for example, scheduling a job to periodically shut down the scripts and delete the .pyc files.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Well, I don't think Python ever interprets code directly if you're loading the code from a file.  Even when using the interactive shell, Python will compile the imported module into a .pyc.  </p>

<p>That said, you could write a shell script to go ahead and delete all the .pyc files before launching your scripts.  That would certainly force a full rebuild before every execution.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You may find <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3147/" rel="nofollow">PEP 3147 - PYC Repository Directories</a> to be of great interest from Python 3.2 onwards.</p>
