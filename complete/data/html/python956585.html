<h3>Question (ID-956585):</h3><h2>python: attributes on a generator object</h2><p>Is it possible to create an attribute on a generator object?</p>

<p>Here's a very simple example:</p>

<pre><code>def filter(x):
    for line in myContent:
        if line == x:
            yield x
</code></pre>

<p>Now say I have a lot of these filter generator objects floating around... maybe some of them are anonymous... I want to go back later and interrogate them for what they are filtering for. Is there a way I can a) interrogate the generator object for the value of x or b) set an attribute with the value of x that I can later interrogate?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<pre><code>class Filter( object ):
    def __init__( self, content ):
        self.content = content
    def __call__( self, someParam ):
        self.someParam = someParam
        for line in self.content:
            if line == someParam:
                yield line
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Unfortunately, generator objects (the results returned from calling a generator function) do not support adding arbitrary attributes. You can work around it to some extent by using an external dict indexed by the generator objects, since such objects <em>are</em> usable as keys into a dict. So where you'd <em>like</em> to do, say:</p>

<pre><code>a = filter(23)
b = filter(45)
...
a.foo = 67
...
x = random.choice([a,b])
if hasattr(x, 'foo'): munge(x.foo)
</code></pre>

<p>you may instead do:</p>

<pre><code>foos = dict()
a = filter(23)
b = filter(45)
...
foos[a] = 67
...
x = random.choice([a,b])
if x in foos: munge(foos[x])
</code></pre>

<p>For anything fancier, use a class instead of a generator (one or more of the class's methods can be generators, after all).</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>No.  You can't set arbitrary attributes on generators.</p>

<p>As S. Lott points out, you can have a object that <em>looks</em> like a generator, and <em>acts</em> like a generator.  And if it looks like a duck, and acts like a duck, you've got yourself the very definition of duck typing, right there.</p>

<p>It won't support generator attributes like <code>gi_frame</code> without the appropriate proxy methods, however.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>If you want to interrogate them for debugging purposes, then the following function will help:</p>

<pre><code>import inspect

def inspect_generator(g):
    sourcecode = open(g.gi_code.co_filename).readlines()
    gline = g.gi_code.co_firstlineno
    generator_code = inspect.getblock(sourcecode[gline-1:])

    output = "Generator %r from %r\n" % (g.gi_code.co_name, g.gi_code.co_filename)
    output += "".join("%4s: %s" % (idx+gline, line) for idx, line in enumerate(generator_code))

    output += "Local variables:\n"
    output += "".join("%s = %r\n" % (key,value) for key,value in g.gi_frame.f_locals.items())

    return output

print inspect_generator(filter(6))
"""Output:
Generator 'filter' from 'generator_introspection.py'
   1: def filter(x):
   2:     for line in myContent:
   3:         if line == x:
   4:             yield x
Local variables:
x = 6
"""
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to interrogate them to implement functionality then classes implementing the iterator protocol are probably a better idea.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I just wrote a decorator to do this here:

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Thinking about the problem, there <em>is</em> a way of having generators carry around a set of attributes.  It's a little crazy--I'd strongly recommend Alex Martelli's suggestion instead of this--but it might be useful in some situations.</p>

<pre><code>my_content = ['cat', 'dog days', 'catfish', 'dog', 'catalog']

def filter(x):
    _query = 'I\'m looking for %r' % x

    def _filter():
        query = yield None
        for line in my_content:
            while query:
                query = yield _query

            if line.startswith(x):
                query = yield line

        while query:
            query = yield _query

    _f = _filter()
    _f.next()
    return _f

for d in filter('dog'):
    print 'Found %s' % d

cats = filter('cat')
for c in cats:
    looking = cats.send(True)
    print 'Found %s (filter %r)' % (c, looking)
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to ask the generator what it's filtering on, just call <code>send</code> with a value that evaluates to true.  Of course, this code is probably too clever by half.  Use with caution.</p>
