<h3>Question (ID-7677275):</h3><h2>List assignment with [:]</h2><p>What's the difference between </p>

<pre><code>list = range(100)
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>list[:] = range(100)
</code></pre>

<p>in Python?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I should have mentioned that before that assignment list variable was already assigned to a list:</p>

<pre><code>list = [1, 2, 3]
list = range(100)
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>list = [1, 2, 3]
list[:] = range(100)
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>When you do</p>

<pre><code>lst = anything
</code></pre>

<p>You're pointing the <em>name</em> <code>lst</code> at an object. It doesn't change the old object <code>lst</code> used to point to in <em>any way</em>, though if nothing else pointed to that object its reference count will drop to zero and it will get deleted.</p>

<p>When you do</p>

<pre><code>lst[:] = whatever
</code></pre>

<p>You're iterating over <code>whatever</code> and assigning each item to an index in the <em>already existing</em> <code>lst</code> object. That means if multiple names point to the same object, you will see the change reflected when you reference any of the names, just as if you use <code>append</code> or <code>extend</code> or any of the other in-place operations.</p>

<p>An example of the difference:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; lst = range(1, 4)
&gt;&gt;&gt; id(lst)
74339392
&gt;&gt;&gt; lst = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; id(lst)  # different; you pointed lst at a new object
73087936
&gt;&gt;&gt; lst[:] = range(1, 4)
&gt;&gt;&gt; id(lst)  # the same, you iterated over the list returned by range
73087936
&gt;&gt;&gt; lst = xrange(1, 4)
&gt;&gt;&gt; lst
xrange(1, 4)   # not a list, an xrange object
&gt;&gt;&gt; id(lst)   # and different
73955976
&gt;&gt;&gt; lst = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; id(lst)    # again different
73105320
&gt;&gt;&gt; lst[:] = xrange(1, 4) # remember this doesn't make a list
&gt;&gt;&gt; id(lst)   # the same, because you iterated over the xrange
73105320
&gt;&gt;&gt; lst    # and still a list
[1, 2, 3]
</code></pre>

<p>So, when you're assigning from an iterable / iterator / generator like <code>xrange</code>, you <em>don't have to store all the items in memory before assigning to</em> <code>lst</code>. That is, when you do normal assignment of an <code>range</code> to a <code>list</code>, and the <code>list</code> already exists, both objects have to exist in memory at the same time -- the old one can't go away until the new one is assigned to the name <code>lst</code>. When you do it with slice assignment and an <code>xrange</code>, you get one item from the <code>xrange</code> at a time and assign it to an index in <code>lst</code>, so you don't have to have much additional memory.</p>

<p>When it comes to speed, slice assignment is slower, though it could theoretically be faster if not using it forced you to swap pages out to disk.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The first one redefines the built-in name <code>list</code> to point to some list.</p>

<p>The second fails with <code>TypeError: 'type' object does not support item assignment</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><code>list[:]</code> will only work if there is already an object named <code>list</code> that allows slice assignment.</p>

<p>Also, you shouldn't name variables <code>list</code> because there is a built-in named <code>list</code> which is the <code>list</code> type itself.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><pre><code>list[:] = range(100)
</code></pre>

<p>won't work on uninitialized variable, as it is modifying it. The <code>[:]</code> specifies the whole list/touple.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>[:] is also useful to make a deep copy of the list.</p>

<pre><code>def x(l):
    f=l[:]
    g=l
    l.append(8)
    print "l", l
    print "g", g
    print "f", f

l = range(3)

print l
 #[0, 1, 2]

x(l)
 #l [0, 1, 2, 8]
 #g [0, 1, 2, 8]
 #f [0, 1, 2]

print l
#[0, 1, 2, 8]
</code></pre>

<p>Modification to l is get reflected in g (because, both point to same list, in fact, both g and l are just names in python), not in f(because, it's a copy of l)</p>

<p>But, in your case, It doesn't make any difference. (Though, I'm not eligible to comment on any memory usage of both methods.)  </p>

<p>Edit  </p>

<pre><code>h = range(3)
id(h) #141312204 
h[:]=range(3)
id(h) #141312204 
h=range(3)
id(h) #141312588 
</code></pre>

<p>list[:] = range(100) updates the list 
list = range(100) creates new list. </p>

<p>@agf: thanks for pointing my error </p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p><code>list[:]</code> specifies a range within the list, in this case it defines the complete range of the list, i.e. the whole list and changes them. <code>list=range(100)</code>, on the other hand, kind of wipes out the original contents of <code>list</code> and sets the new contents.</p>

<p>But try the following:</p>

<pre><code>a=[1,2,3,4]

a[0:2]=[5,6]

a # prints [5,6,3,4]
</code></pre>

<p>You see, we changed the first two elements with the assignment. This means, using this notation, you can change several elements in the list once.</p>
