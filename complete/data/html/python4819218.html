<h3>Question (ID-4819218):</h3><h2>Looking for a complete developer ide?</h2><p>I'm searching for an open-source ide for ubuntu which should support <strong>jsp,java,js,jquery,html,python</strong>..</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Try <a href="http://eclipse.org" rel="nofollow">Eclipse</a> </p>

<p>You can install eclipse plugins for each of those languages.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Vim/Gvim</p>

<p>By using plugins you can get almost every desired feature from an ide, without all the bloat.  You also have the advantage of it being a customized environment.  Only what you want is there, and nothing to get in the way.</p>

<p>There is an insanely steep learning curve, but it is well worth it, in my opinion.  Once you learn vim, you can code like a ninja.</p>

<p>So if you want a highly customized, highly effective coding tool and are willing to spend the time needed to learn how to master this tool, give vim/gvim a try.  Otherwise, use Eclipse.  it's the best turn-key ide, imho.</p>

<p>Update:<br />
Here is some <a href="http://www.installationwiki.org/Installing_Vim_Scripts" rel="nofollow">information on vim plugins</a>, including how to "install" them. <br />
The following link contains a little more <a href="http://answers.wikia.com/wiki/How_do_you_install_Vim_plugins" rel="nofollow">information about vim directories.</a></p>

<p>Finding a vim plugin can sometimes be a little bit of work.  If you are looking for a particluar functionality, a good place to start is always <a href="http://www.vim.org/" rel="nofollow">vim online.</a>  I've added a few links at the end to lists of "must have" plugins to get you started.</p>

<p>Google can also be extremly helpful.  If for example, you are looking for syntax highlighting for javascript, simply google <code>vim javascript syntax highlighting</code>.  It may also be helpful to google <code>vim language ide</code> where language is any programming language.  This can help find sets of plugins other people use to make coding in a language easier.</p>

<p>When trying to find the perfect set of plugins, remember, be patient and experiment.  Vim is <em>not</em> a ready made ide.  It's more like a "build your own" ide.  While this requires a lot more extra work in the beginning, the end product is an ide customized exactly to your needs and your workflow.  </p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>With the right tweaks, you can make Vim / Emacs into a pretty functional IDE.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>IntelliJ from JetBrains will do all this magnificently.  There is a community edition, but it's not as full-featured as the commercial edition.  Worth the price and more.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>For web development, which is what you're talking about, give <a href="http://bluefish.openoffice.nl/" rel="nofollow">BlueFish</a> a try. Personally, I'd recommend against Eclipse - it's far too bloated for what you may want to do :-)</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>It really depends on what you mean by 'support'. Some criteria might include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Syntax highlighting</li>
<li>Code completion
<ul>
<li>Understanding class structures for automatic method completion</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Documentation support (POD, javadoc, etc.)</li>
<li>Build support</li>
<li>Test support</li>
</ul>

<p>I would advise strongly against paying for an IDE unless it gives you something that is <em>significantly</em> useful and worth the cost. There are enough free IDEs out there that paying for one should require some strong justification.</p>

<p>And IDE like Eclipse has the benefit of supporting plugins, so you can extend it as necessary. Vi &amp; Emacs have the same benefits.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Did you try the Netbeans IDE for Ubuntu? It does a pretty job at that. Additionally, it is a full IDE/WYSIWYG editor. It has project management and a good UI, is my favorite.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Honestly, I think gedit is pretty underrated. It typically comes with ubuntu and gnome.</p>

<p>Clean native ui editor, decent language syntax support, and much lighter weight than eclipse while not being quite as hard core as vim.</p>
