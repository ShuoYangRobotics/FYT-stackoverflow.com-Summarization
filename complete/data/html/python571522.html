<h3>Question (ID-571522):</h3><h2>What's the reason of providing some of the default methods in the global scope in Python?</h2><p>What's the reason of providing some of the default methods in the global scope, like the len function, instead of providing them on an instance level, like:</p>

<pre><code>list.len()
</code></pre>

<p>instead of:</p>

<pre><code>len (list)
</code></pre>

<p>I find methods like len to be harder to discover than instance methods.</p>

<p>Is there any reason behind this?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>This question is very similar to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/83983/why-isnt-the-len-function-inherited-by-dictionaries-and-lists-in-python">this one</a>. And the answers is the same:</p>

<p>Because Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python, thinks that prefix notation is more readable in some cases. <a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-3000/2006-November/004643.html" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is the complete answer. I'm going to quote some parts:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) For some operations, prefix notation just reads better than
  postfix -- prefix (and infix!) operations have a long tradition in
  mathematics which likes notations where the visuals help the
  mathematician thinking about a problem. Compare the easy with which we
  rewrite a formula like x*(a+b) into x*a + x*b to the clumsiness of
  doing the same thing using a raw OO notation.</p>
  
  <p>(b) When I read code that says len(x) I <em>know</em> that it is asking for
  the length of something. This tells me two things: the result is an
  integer, and the argument is some kind of container. To the contrary,
  when I read x.len(), I have to already know that x is some kind of
  container implementing an interface or inheriting from a class that
  has a standard len(). Witness the confusion we occasionally have when
  a class that is not implementing a mapping has a get() or keys()
  method, or something that isn't a file has a write() method.</p>
  
  <p>Saying the same thing in another way, I see 'len' as a built-in
  <em>operation</em>. I'd hate to lose that. I can't say for sure whether you
  meant that or not, but 'def len(self): ...' certainly sounds like you
  want to demote it to an ordinary method. I'm strongly -1 on that.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.python.org/doc/faq/general/#why-does-python-use-methods-for-some-functionality-e-g-list-index-but-functions-for-other-e-g-len-list" rel="nofollow">This FAQ entry</a> might answer your question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>4.7   Why does Python use methods for some functionality (e.g. list.index())
  but functions for other (e.g.
  len(list))?</p>
  
  <p>The major reason is history. Functions
  were used for those operations that
  were generic for a group of types and
  which were intended to work even for
  objects that didn't have methods at
  all (e.g. tuples). It is also
  convenient to have a function that can
  readily be applied to an amorphous
  collection of objects when you use the
  functional features of Python (map(),
  apply() et al).</p>
  
  <p>In fact, implementing len(), max(),
  min() as a built-in function is
  actually less code than implementing
  them as methods for each type. One can
  quibble about individual cases but
  it's a part of Python, and it's too
  late to make such fundamental changes
  now. The functions have to remain to
  avoid massive code breakage.</p>
  
  <p>Note that for string operations Python
  has moved from external functions (the
  string module) to methods. However,
  len() is still a function.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a list of all those functions (not too many) <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html" rel="nofollow">here in the docs</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Once you learn the "len" method, you know you can apply it to any sequence.  You don't have to read the doc for each sequence you encounter to find out whether or not it has a len method.  There's an expectation that it does.</p>

<p>Built-in functions are not harder to discover because there's a list of built-in methods in the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html" rel="nofollow">python documentation</a>.  You can learn them all in one sitting from <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html" rel="nofollow">this page</a> instead of having to hunt for them all over the class library Java style.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Besides the FAQ answer provided by MrTopf, lists (and other objects) do have a length method <strong>__len__()</strong></p>

<p>The len() function is just a shorthand for calling that method.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>They are fairly discoverable:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import __builtin__
&gt;&gt;&gt; dir(__builtin__)
['ArithmeticError', 'AssertionError', ...
...
</code></pre>

<p>or better</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; help(__builtin__)

Help on built-in module __builtin__:

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You can write</p>

<pre><code>re.match(r"\w+", "dog")
</code></pre>

<p>instead of</p>

<pre><code>pattern = re.compile(r"\w+")
pattern.match("dog")
</code></pre>

<p>Like You noticed, sometimes it doesn't make sense.</p>
