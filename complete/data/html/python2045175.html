<h3>Question (ID-2045175):</h3><h2>Regex match even number of letters</h2><p>Sorry if this is redundant.</p>

<p>I need to match an expression in python with regular expressions that only matches even number of letter occurances. For example:</p>

<pre><code># Even number of A's
AAA # no match
AA # match
fsfaAAasdf #match
sAfA  # match
sdAAewAsA # match
AeAiA  # no match
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: Sorry for confusion. You are right - even number of A's SHOULD match. Like I said - was tired. Thank you</p>

<p>EDIT2: If you down-vote my question - please comment on what the problem is. I want to make it as clear and as useful as possible to people. Thank you.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Try this regular expression:</p>

<pre><code>^[^A]*((AA)+[^A]*)*$
</code></pre>

<p>And if the <code>A</code>s donâ€™t need to be consecutive:</p>

<pre><code>^[^A]*(A[^A]*A[^A]*)*$
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><code>'A*'</code> means match any number of <code>A</code>'s.  Even 0.</p>

<p>Here's how to match a string with an even number of a's, upper or lower:</p>

<pre><code>re.compile(r'''
    ^
    [^a]*
    (
        (
            a[^a]*
        ){2}
    # if there must be at least 2 (not just 0), change the
    # '*' on the following line to '+'
    )* 
    $
    ''',re.IGNORECASE|re.VERBOSE)
</code></pre>

<p>You probably are using <code>a</code> as an example.  If you want to match a specific character other than <code>a</code>, replace <code>a</code> with <code>%s</code> and then insert</p>

<pre><code>[...]
$
'''%( other_char, other_char, other_char )
[...]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>'*' means 0 or more occurences
'AA' should do the trick.</p>

<p>The question is if you want the thing to match 'AAA'. In that case you would have to do something like:</p>

<pre><code>r = re.compile('(^|[^A])(AA)+(?!A)',)
r.search(p)
</code></pre>

<p>That would work for match even (and only even) number of'A'.</p>

<p>Now if you want to match 'if there is any even number of subsequent letters', this would do the trick:</p>

<pre><code>re.compile(r'(.)\1')
</code></pre>

<p>However, this wouldn't exclude the 'odd' occurences. But it is not clear from your question if you really want that.</p>

<p>Update:
This works for you test cases:</p>

<pre><code>re.compile('^([^A]*)AA([^A]|AA)*$')
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>First of all, note that <code>/A*/</code> matches the empty string.</p>

<p>Secondly, there are some things that you just can't do with regular expressions. This'll be a lot easier if you just walk through the string and count up all occurences of the letter you're looking for.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>A* means match "A" zero or more times.</p>

<p>For an even number of "A", try: (AA)+</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>This searches for a block with an odd number of A's. If you found one, the string is bad for you:</p>

<pre><code>(?&lt;!A)A(AA)*(?!A)
</code></pre>

<p>If I understand correctly, the Python code should look like:</p>

<pre><code>if re.search("(?&lt;!A)A(AA)*(?!A)", "AeAAi"):
   print "fail"
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Why work so hard coming up with a hard to read pattern? Just search for all occurrences of the pattern and count how many you find. </p>

<pre><code>len(re.findall("A", "AbcAbcAbcA")) % 2 == 0
</code></pre>

<p>That should be instantly understandable by all experienced programmers, whereas a pattern like "(?

<p>Simple is better.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>It's <strong>impossible</strong> to count <strong>arbitrarily</strong> using regular expressions.  For example, making sure that you have matching parenthesis. To count you need 'memory' which requires something at least as strong as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushdown_automaton" rel="nofollow">pushdown automaton</a>, although in this case you can use the regular expression that @Gumbo provided.</p>

<p>The suggestion to use <code>finditer</code>is the best workaround for the general case.</p>
