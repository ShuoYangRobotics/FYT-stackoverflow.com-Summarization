<h3>Question (ID-1463489):</h3><h2>How do I pass template context information when using HttpResponseRedirect in Django?</h2><p>I have a form that redirects to the same page after a user enters information (so that they can continue entering information).  If the form submission is successful, I'm returning</p>

<pre><code>HttpResponseRedirect(request.path)
</code></pre>

<p>which works fine.  However, I'd also like to display some messages to the user in this case (e.g., "Your data has been saved" at the top of the screen).  If I weren't redirecting, I'd just return these messages in the context dictionary.  With the redirect, however, I can't do this.</p>

<p>So how can I pass template context information when using HttpResponseRedirect?  </p>

<p>What I'm trying to do seems like it would be incredibly common, so please excuse me if I'm missing something obvious.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The best way would probably be to use a coded querystring on the redirect URL... its an old school approach.</p>

<p>You could do something like</p>

<p>/page/?m=1, /page/?m=2, etc</p>

<p>You would then parse that variable with request.GET in the view code and show the appropriate message.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>if you are using auth and have a logged in user you could: </p>

<p>GET params are also hackable.  Teh querystring, as mentioned in other answers.</p>

<p>I think that the most choice way would be to use the sessions framework.  That way you can load up whatever you want in the context and get</p>

<pre><code>{{ request.session.foo }} 
</code></pre>

<p>could be the message or you could </p>

<pre><code>{% ifequal request.session.foo 1 %} Nice work! {% else %} Almost! {% endifequal %}
</code></pre>

<p>and other fun stuff.</p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You can't. HttpResponseRedirect sends a client-side redirect (HTTP status code 302) to the browser, and then the browser re-requests another page.</p>

<p>You can set a URL query string on the redirect, though that will be visible to the user and anyone intercepting HTTP requests (i.e. proxies), and is therefore not suitable for sensitive information.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The only way I know of to pass any data with a redirect is to add GET parameters to the URL you're passing in.  To avoid XSS hacks you'd want to pass a specific constant like:</p>

<p>[current path you're passing in]?message=saved</p>

<p>And then process the message=saved parameter in the handler for the path you passed in.</p>

<p>A somewhat more complicated way would be not passing the data in the redirect, and instead using something like <a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-notify/" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/django-notify/</a> to store session-based data that is displayed to the user following the redirect.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You add ?saved=1 to the query string and check for it with something like:</p>

<pre><code>saved = request.GET.get('saved', False)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>From your views.py you hast have to put a key/value-pair into the session and then read it from the HTML template.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p><strong>views.py</strong></p>

<pre><code># your code here
request.session['vote'] = 1
return HttpResponseRedirect(request.path)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>your_template.html</strong></p>

<pre><code>{% ifequal request.session.vote 1 %}
    &lt;!-- Your action here --&gt;
{% endifequal  %}
</code></pre>
