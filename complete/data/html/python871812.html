<h3>Question (ID-871812):</h3><h2>Simple List of All Java Standard Classes and Methods?</h2><p>I'm building a very simple Java parser, to look for some specific usage models. This is in no way lex/yacc or any other form of interpreter/compiler for puposes of running the code. </p>

<p>When I encounter a word or a set of two words separated by a dot ("word.word"), I would like to know if that's a standard Java class (and method), e.g. "Integer", or some user defined name. I'm not interested in whether the proper classes were included/imported in the code (i.e. if the code compiles well), and the extreme cases of user defined classes that override the names of standard Java classes also does not interest me. In other words: I'm okay with false negative, I'm only interesting in being "mostly" right.</p>

<p>If there a place wher I could find a simple list of all the names of all Java standard classes and methods, in the form easily saved into a text file or database? (J2SE is okay, but J2EE is better). I'm familiar with <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/" rel="nofollow">http://java.sun.com/j2se/</a> etc, but it seems I need a terrible amount of manual work to extract all the names from there. Also, the most recent JDK is not neccesary, I can live with 1.4 or 1.5. </p>

<p>Clarification: I'm not working in Java but in Python, so I can't use Java-specific commands in my parsing mechanism.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

The <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/allclasses-frame.html" rel="nofollow">index</a> lists all classes, methods, and static variables. You can probably grep for parenthesis.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>To get all classes and methods you can look at the index on
<a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/index-files/index-1.html" rel="nofollow">http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/index-files/index-1.html</a></p>

<p>This will be 10's of thousands classes and method which can be overwhelming.</p>

<p>I suggest instead you use auto-complete in your IDE.  This will show you all the matching classes/methods appropriate based on context. 
e.g. say you have a variable</p>

<p>long time = System.</p>

<p>This will show you all the methods in System which return a long value, such as</p>

<p>long time = System.nanoTime();</p>

<p>Even if you know a lot of the method/classes, this can save you a lot of typing.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If you just want to create a list of all classes in Java and their methods (so that you can populate a database or an XML file), you may want to write an Eclipse-plugin that looks at the entire JavaCore model, and scans all of its classes (e.g., by searching all subtypes of Object). Then enumerate all the methods. You can do that technically to any library by including it in your context.</p>

<p>If thats what you're after, you could do without a (limited) list of Java Classes by using some simple reflection:
<a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/ALT/Reflection/" rel="nofollow">http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/ALT/Reflection/</a></p>

<pre><code>try {
  Class.forName("word.word");
  System.out.println("This is a valid class!");
} catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
  System.out.println("This is not a valid class.");
}
</code></pre>

<p>Something like this should be enough for your purposes, with he added benefit of not being limited to a subset of classes, and extensible by any libraries on the classpath.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>There's also an option to either parse <code>classlist</code> file from jre/lib folder or open the <code>jsse.jar</code> file, list all classes there and make a list of them in dot-separated form by yourself.</p>
