<h3>Question (ID-6149370):</h3><h2>Python, working with list comprehensions</h2><p>I have such code:</p>

<pre><code>a = [[1, 1], [2, 1], [3, 0]]
</code></pre>

<p>I want to get two lists, the first contains elements of <code>'a'</code>, where <code>a[][1] = 1</code>, and the second - elements where <code>a[][1] = 0</code>. So </p>

<pre><code>first_list = [[1, 1], [2, 1]] 

second_list = [[3, 0]]. 
</code></pre>

<p>I can do such thing with two list comprehension:</p>

<pre><code>first_list = [i for i in a if i[1] == 1]

second_list = [i for i in a if i[1] == 0]
</code></pre>

<p>But maybe exists other (more pythonic, or shorter) way to do this? Thanks for your answers.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>List comprehension are very pythonic and the recommended way of doing this. Your code is fine.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>If you want to have it in a single line you could do something like</p>

<pre><code>first_list, second_list = [i for i in a if i[1] == 1], [i for i in a if i[1] == 0]
</code></pre>

<p>Remember that, "Explicit is better than implicit."</p>

<p>Your code is fine</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You can use <code>sorted()</code> and <code>itertools.groupby()</code> to do this, but I don't know that it would qualify as Pythonic per se:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; dict((k, list(v)) for (k, v) in itertools.groupby(sorted(a, key=operator.itemgetter(1)), operator.itemgetter(1)))
{0: [[3, 0]], 1: [[1, 1], [2, 1]]}
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>what about this,  </p>

<pre><code>In [1]: a = [[1, 1], [2, 1], [3, 0]]

In [2]: first_list = []

In [3]: second_list = []

In [4]: [first_list.append(i) if i[1] == 1 else second_list.append(i) for i in a]
Out[4]: [None, None, None]

In [5]: first_list, second_list
Out[5]: ([[1, 1], [2, 1]], [[3, 0]])
</code></pre>

<p>instead of two sublist, I prefer dict (or defaultdict, OrderedDict, Counter, etc.)</p>

<pre><code>In [6]: from collections import defaultdict

In [7]: d = defaultdict(list)

In [8]: [d[i[1]].append(i) for i in a]
Out[8]: [None, None, None]

In [9]: d
Out[9]: {0: [[3, 0]], 1: [[1, 1], [2, 1]]}
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>If the lists are reasonably short then two list comprehensions will do fine: you shouldn't be worried about performance until your code is all working and you know it is too slow.</p>

<p>If your lists are long or the code runs often <strong>and</strong> you have demonstrated that it is a bottleneck then all you have to do is switch from list comprehensions to a for loop:</p>

<pre><code>first_list, second_list = [], []
for element in a:
    if element[1] == 1:
        first_list.append(element)
    else:
        second_list.append(element)
</code></pre>

<p>which is both clear and easily extended to more cases.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>list comprehensions are great. If you want slightly more simple code (but slightly longer) then just use a for loop.</p>

<p>Yet another option would be filters and maps:</p>

<pre><code>a = [[1, 1], [2, 1], [3, 0]]
g1=filter(lambda i: i[1]==1,a)
g1=map(lambda i: i[0],g1)
g2=filter(lambda i: i[1]==0,a)
g2=map(lambda i: i[0],g2)
print g1
print g2
</code></pre>
