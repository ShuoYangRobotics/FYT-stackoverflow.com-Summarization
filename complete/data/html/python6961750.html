<h3>Question (ID-6961750):</h3><h2>Locating the line number where an exception occurs in python code</h2><p>I have a code similar to this:</p>

<pre><code>try:
  if x:
      statement1
      statement2
      statement3
  elif y:
      statement4
      statement5
      statement6
  else:
      raise

except:
      statement7
</code></pre>

<p>Here, I am sure that the exception occurs in <code>If x:</code> block, but I would like to know in which statement of <code>If x:</code> block the exception occurs. Is there a way to get the line number where the exception occurs?</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<pre><code>try:
  if x:
      print 'before statement 1'
      statement1
      print 'before statement 2' #ecc. ecc.
      statement2
      statement3
  elif y:
      statement4
      statement5
      statement6
  else:
      raise

except:
      statement7
</code></pre>

<p>this is the straightforward workaround but I suggest to use a debugger</p>

<p>or even better, use the sys module :D</p>

<pre><code>try:
      if x:
          print 'before statement 1'
          statement1
          print 'before statement 2' #ecc. ecc.
          statement2
          statement3
      elif y:
          statement4
          statement5
          statement6
      else:
          raise
except:
    print sys.exc_traceback.tb_lineno 
    #this is the line number, but there are also other infos
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You should wrap the statements you care about more tightly.  Extracting the line number from the traceback is going to be involved and fragile.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If you restructure the code like so, you should get a line number when the exception is raised again:</p>

<pre><code>except:
    statement7
    raise
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I believe the several answers here recommending you manage your <code>try/except</code> blocks more tightly are the answer you're looking for.   That's a style thing, not a library thing.</p>

<p>However, at times we find ourselves in a situation where it's not a style thing, and you really <em>do</em> need the line number to do some other programattic action.   If that's what you're asking, you should consider the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/traceback.html" rel="nofollow"><code>traceback</code></a> module.  You can extract all the information you need about the most recent exception.  The <code>tb_lineno</code> function will return the line number causing the exception. </p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import traceback
&gt;&gt;&gt; dir(traceback)
['__all__', '__builtins__', '__doc__', '__file__', '__name__', '__package__', '_format_final_exc_line', '_print', '_some_str', 'extract_stack', 'extract_tb', 'format_exc', 'format_exception', 'format_exception_only', 'format_list', 'format_stack', 'format_tb', 'linecache', 'print_exc', 'print_exception', 'print_last', 'print_list', 'print_stack', 'print_tb', 'sys', 'tb_lineno', 'types']
&gt;&gt;&gt; help(traceback.tb_lineno)
Help on function tb_lineno in module traceback:

tb_lineno(tb)
Calculate correct line number of traceback given in tb.
Obsolete in 2.3
</code></pre>

<p>Newer versions of the traceback plumbing fix the issue prior to 2.3, allowing the code below to work as it was intended:  (this is the "right way")</p>

<pre><code>import traceback
import sys

try:
    raise Exception("foo")
except:
    for frame in traceback.extract_tb(sys.exc_info()[2]):
        fname,lineno,fn,text = frame
        print "Error in %s on line %d" % (fname, lineno)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Remove the lines one at a time...</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Using a general except statement is usually a bad programming practice, so you should specify in your except statement what exception you want to catch. ( like except ValueError: ) </p>

<p>Moreover, you should surround with a try except structure the bits of code that are supposed to be raising an exception.</p>
