<h3>Question (ID-1817144):</h3><h2>Constants in python?</h2><p>I have the following variables declared in a lot of functions, as I need those values in each one of them. Is there anyway I can declare them at a global scope or something, such as I won't have to declare them in all my methods? I am using all this methods on instance methods of a class of mine.</p>

<pre><code>x = 0
y = 1
t = 2
</code></pre>

<p>In c# I'd just declare them as global class variables, but the problem is that I don't want to have to use them always as self.x, self.y and self.z, as it gets my algorithm's code uglier than it already is. How would you do this?</p>

<p>A typical usage of this would be:</p>

<pre><code>def _GetStateFromAction(self, state, action):
    x = 0
    y = 1
    t = 2

    if (action == 0):
        return (state[x], state[y] - 1, state[t])

    if (action == 1):
        return (state[x] - 1, state[y], state[t])
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>If they're all within a single module, then they only live in that module's namespace and you don't have to worry about name clashes. (And you can still import them into other namesapaces)</p>

<p>For example</p>

<p>MyModWithContstants.py</p>

<pre><code>x = 0
y = 0

def someFunc():
  dosomethingwithconstants(x,y)
</code></pre>

<p>and we can also do</p>

<p>anotherMod.py</p>

<pre><code>from MyModWithConstants import x
# and also we can do
import MyModWithConstants as MMWC

def somOtherFunc():
  dosomethingNew(x, MMWC.y)  
  ## x and MMWC.y both refer to things in the other file
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>In addition to the separate module trick, if I want them in the same module I'll often put them in a class, <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/winpaths/0.1" rel="nofollow">like this</a>:</p>

<pre><code>class PathConstants(object):
    CSIDL_DESKTOP = 0
    CSIDL_PROGRAMS = 2

def get_desktop():
    return _get_path_buf(PathConstants.CSIDL_DESKTOP)
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to make them more constant-y, then you can make setattr throw:</p>

<pre><code>class ConstantExeption(Exception):
    pass

class ProgramConstants(object):
    foo = 10
    bar = 13
    def __setattr__(self, key, val):
        raise ConstantExeption("Cannot change value of %s" % key)

# got to use an instance...
constants = ProgramConstants()
print constants.foo
constants.bar = "spam"
</code></pre>

<p>The traceback:</p>

<pre><code>10
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "...", line 14, in &lt;module&gt;
    constants.bar = "spam"
  File "...", line 9, in __setattr__
    raise ConstantExeption("Cannot change value of %s" % key)
__main__.ConstantExeption: Cannot change value of bar
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You could simply declare these variables at the module level (i.e. the top level of the <code>.py</code> source file) and there will be no need to use <code>self</code> or anything like that. In that case I think the convention would be to give them uppercase names.</p>

<p>By the way, I can't help but point out that you could be declaring them like this:</p>

<pre><code>x, y, t = 0, 1, 2
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>If these "variables" are truly constants declaring them at module level seems logical. If you have to modify them from inside a function you just have to declare them global in that function.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Have you considered </p>

<pre><code>global x, y, z
x=0
y=1
z=2
</code></pre>

<p>?</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><pre>import __builtin__
__builtin__.__dict__["X"] = 5</pre>

<p>This will store the X constant in all modules executed until the interpreter exits.</p>

<p>Remember though to use it with care, as other python developers are not likely to expect this.
I use it mainly for storing the translation function '_'.</p>
