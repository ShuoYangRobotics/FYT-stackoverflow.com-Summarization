<h3>Question (ID-2498009):</h3><h2>Best way to encrypt a directory of files?</h2><p>I need to programatically encrypt a directory of files, like in a .zip or whatever.  Preferably password protected obviously.</p>

<p>How can I accomplish this, and WHAT IS the BEST  encryption way to do it, if applicable?</p>

<p>Programming language doesn't matter.  I am dictioned in all syntax.</p>

<ul>
<li>tar and gzip the directory. </li>
<li>Generate a random bit stream of equal size to the file</li>
<li>Run bitwise XOR on the streams</li>
</ul>

<p>Only truly secure method is a truly random one time pad.</p>

GnuPG is the GNU project's complete and free implementation of the OpenPGP standard as defined by RFC4880 . GnuPG allows to encrypt and sign your data and communication, features a versatile key managment system as well as access modules for all kind of public key directories. GnuPG, also known as GPG, is a command line tool with features for easy integration with other applications. A wealth of frontend applications and libraries are available. Version 2 of GnuPG also provides support for S/MIME.

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The <strong>OpenSSL</strong> library has a variety of block cipher implementations including the well-known AES.  It has both a function-call interface (for use with languages like C/C++) and a program-call interface (for use in shell scripts).  <a href="http://www.openssl.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.openssl.org/</a></p>
