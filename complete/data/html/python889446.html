<h3>Question (ID-889446):</h3><h2>Dividing in an if statement</h2><p>In Python, if I had a range, and I wanted to iterate over it and divide each number by another number, could I do that in a if statement.</p>

<pre><code>a = range(20)
for i in a:
   if i / 3 == True:
      print i
</code></pre>

<p>Please, please, please.  Never say <code>if some expression == True</code>.  It's redundant and causes many people to wonder what you're thinking.</p>

<p>More importantly. </p>

<p><code>i/3</code> is the quotient.</p>

<p><code>i%3</code> is the remainder.  If i is a multiple of 3, <code>i%3 == 0</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>At the command prompt:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; [i for i in range(20) if i%3 == 0]
&gt;&gt;&gt; [0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18]
</code></pre>

<p>OR</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [i for i in range(20) if i%3 == 0]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print a
[0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18]
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Everyone here has done a good job explaining how to do it right. I just want to explain what you are doing wrong.</p>

<pre><code>if i / 3 == True
</code></pre>

<p>Is equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>if i / 3 == 1
</code></pre>

<p>Because True == 1. So you are basicly checking if i when divided by 3 equals 1. Your code will actually print 3 4 5.</p>

<p>I think what you wanted to do is to check if i is a multiple of 3. Like this:</p>

<pre><code>if i % 3 == 0
</code></pre>

<p>You can of course use an if statement to do it. Or you can use <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow">list comprehension</a> with if</p>

<pre><code>[x for x in range(20) if x % 3 == 0]
</code></pre>

<p>To those how are down voting this, from <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/lib/node34.html" rel="nofollow">python documentation</a>:</p>

<p>Boolean values are the two constant objects False and True. They are used to represent truth values (although other values can also be considered false or true). <strong>In numeric contexts (for example when used as the argument to an arithmetic operator), they behave like the integers 0 and 1, respectively.</strong></p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Hmm seems you want a weird thing - you divide i by 3 and check if it is equal to 1.
As 4 == True => False.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Short answer: no.  You cannot make assignments in if statements in python.</p>

<p>But really, I don't understand what you are trying to do here. Your sample code will only print out the numbers 3, 4, and 5 because every other value of i divided by 3 evaluates to something other than 1 (and therefore false).</p>

<p>If you want to divide everything in a list by 3, you want map(lambda x: x / 3, range(20)). if you want decimal answers, map(lambda x : x / 3.0, range(20)). These will return a new list where each element is a the number in the original list divided by three.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>While working on Project Euler myself, I found "<code>if not x % y</code>" to be the cleanest way to represent "if x is a multiple of y".  This is equivalent to "<code>if x % y == 0</code>", seen in other answers.  I don't believe there is a significant difference between the two; which you use is simply a matter of personal preference.</p>
