<h3>Question (ID-776120):</h3><h2>Multiple simultaneous network connections - Telnet server, Python</h2><p>I'm currently writing a telnet server in Python. It's a content server. People would connect to the server via telnet, and be presented with text-only content.</p>

<p>My problem is that the server would obviously need to support more than one simultaneous connection. The current implementation I have now supports only one. </p>

<p>This is the basic, proof-of-concept server I began with (while the program has changed greatly over time, the basic telnet framework hasn't):</p>

<pre><code>import socket, os

class Server:
    def __init__(self):
    	self.host, self.port = 'localhost', 50000
    	self.socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    	self.socket.bind((self.host, self.port))

    def send(self, msg):
    	if type(msg) == str: self.conn.send(msg + end)
    	elif type(msg) == list or tuple: self.conn.send('\n'.join(msg) + end)

    def recv(self):
    	self.conn.recv(4096).strip()

    def exit(self):
    	self.send('Disconnecting you...'); self.conn.close(); self.run()
    	# closing a connection, opening a new one

    # main runtime
    def run(self):
    	self.socket.listen(1)
    	self.conn, self.addr = self.socket.accept()
    	# there would be more activity here
    	# i.e.: sending things to the connection we just made


S = Server()
S.run()

<p>Thanks for your help. </p>

<pre><code>from twisted.internet.protocol import Factory, Protocol
from twisted.internet import reactor

class SendContent(Protocol):
    def connectionMade(self):
        self.transport.write(self.factory.text)

class SendContentFactory(Factory):
    protocol = SendContent
    def __init__(self, text=None):
        if text is None:
            text = """Hello, how are you my friend? Feeling fine? Good!"""
        self.text = text

reactor.listenTCP(50000, SendContentFactory())
reactor.run()

<p>Testing:</p>

<pre><code>$ telnet localhost 50000
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
Hello, how are you my friend? Feeling fine? Good!
Connection closed by foreign host.
</code></pre>

<p>Seriously, when it comes to asynchronous network, twisted is the way to go. It handles multiple connections in a single-thread single-process approach.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You need some form of asynchronous socket IO. Have a look at <a href="http://squirl.nightmare.com/medusa/async%5Fsockets.html" rel="nofollow">this explanation</a>, which discusses the concept in low-level socket terms, and the related examples which are implemented in Python. That should point you in the right direction.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If you're up for a bit of a conceptual challenge, I'd look into using twisted. </p>

<p>Your case should be trivial to implement as a part of twisted.

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>For a really easy win implement you solution using SocketServer &amp; the SocketServer.ThreadingMixIn</p>

<p>have a look a this echo server example it looks quite similar to what you're doing anyway: <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/onlamp/blog/2007/12/pymotw_socketserver.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.oreillynet.com/onlamp/blog/2007/12/pymotw_socketserver.html</a></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Late for the reply, but with the only answers being Twisted or threads (ouch), I wanted to add an answer for MiniBoa. </p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/miniboa/" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/miniboa/</a></p>

<p>Twisted is great, but it's a rather large beast that may not be the best introduction to single-threaded asynchronous Telnet programming. MiniBoa is a lightweight, asynchronous single-threaded Python Telnet implementation originally designed for muds, which suits the OP's question perfectly. </p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>If you want to do it in pure python (sans-twisted), you need to do some threading. If you havnt seen it before, check out:
<a href="http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/Python/PyThreads.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/Python/PyThreads.pdf</a></p>

<p>around page 5/6 is an example that is <em>very</em> relevant ;)</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Try MiniBoa server? It has exactly 0 dependencies, no twisted or other stuff needed. MiniBoa is a non-blocking async telnet server, single threaded, exactly what you need.</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/miniboa/" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/miniboa/</a></p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>First, buy Comer's books on <a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dec/netbooks.html" rel="nofollow">TCP/IP programming</a>.  </p>

<p>In those books, Comer will provide several alternative algorithms for servers.  There are two standard approaches.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Thread-per-request.</p></li>
<li><p>Process-per-request.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You must pick one of these two and implement that.</p>

<p>In thread-per, each telnet session is a separate thread in your overall application.</p>

<p>In process-per, you fork each telnet session into a separate subprocess.</p>

<p>You'll find that process-per-request is much, much easier to handle in Python, and it generally makes more efficient use of your system.</p>

<p>Thread-per-request is fine for things that come and go quickly (like HTTP requests).  Telnet has long-running sessions where the startup cost for a subprocess does not dominate performance.</p>
