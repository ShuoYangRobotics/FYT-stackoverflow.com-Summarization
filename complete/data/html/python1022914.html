<h3>Question (ID-1022914):</h3><h2>Deploying Django</h2><p>When finding web hosting for Rails apps, the hoster must have support for ruby on rails -- that is evident.  What about hosting for Django?  What support does the hoster need to provide?  Python, or more than just Python?</p>

<p>This might seem like an obvious question, but I'm new to web development frameworks so I must ask :)</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>It just needs to support Python 2.3 or later (but not 3.0, yet), preferably with <code>mod_wsgi</code> support (although it also works with <a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/ServerArrangements" rel="nofollow">a bunch of other options</a>, if required).</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Technically, as other responders say, the host needs very little (hey, Django even runs with Google app engine for all the latter's limitations!-).  But if you want a little bit more (as in, say, <em>support</em> for any issues you might encounter!), I suggest you read <a href="http://djangohosting.org/" rel="nofollow">this site</a> as well -- it will take you but a short time, and it may prove to be really useful info.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Other responses have covered the technical question, but it should also be mentioned that <a href="http://djangofriendly.com" rel="nofollow">djangofriendly.com</a> is an invaluable resource for selecting a Django web host.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Python is all that is needed.</p>

<p>I think there is a cPanel plugin which allows your users to create and deploy Django applications, so if you have a VPS or Reseller account, or your host is running cPanel, you could simply tell them to install it. If I find the link to the plugin I will post it here.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Well, Python is <strong>not</strong> the <em>only</em> thing need <strong>if you run a dedicated server</strong>.</p>

<p>You need(please correct me if I'm missing something):</p>

<ul>
<li>A webserver which will communicate
with your Django web application,
e.g.: Apache with mod_wsgi.</li>
<li>A database interface, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL (just to mention some popular).</li>
<li>Python.</li>
<li>(Dependencies, Libraries, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>You may want to read <a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/ServerArrangements" rel="nofollow">this</a> or <a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/DjangoResources#CheatSheetsandQuickStarts" rel="nofollow">some general resources</a></p>

<p><strong>If you use some hosting service</strong>, then you'll probably need to find a provider who claims to be able to run Django ;)</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>We have already installed the requirements on the server. My point is that, will django be available there as we use fantastico in Cpanel?</p>
