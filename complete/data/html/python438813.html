<h3>Question (ID-438813):</h3><h2>How do you create a list like PHP's in Python?</h2><p>This is an incredibly simple question (I'm new to Python).</p>

<p>I basically want a data structure like a PHP array -- i.e., I want to initialise it and then just add values into it.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, this is not possible with Python, so I've got the maximum value I might want to use as an index, but I can't figure out how to create an empty list of a specified length.</p>

<p>Also, is a list the right data structure to use to model what feels like it should just be an array? I tried to use an array, but it seemed unhappy with storing strings.</p>

<p>Edit: Sorry, I didn't explain very clearly what I was looking for. When I add items into the list, I do not want to put them in in sequence, but rather I want to insert them into specified slots in the list.</p>

<p>I.e., I want to be able to do this:</p>

<pre><code>list = []

for row in rows:
  c = list_of_categories.index(row["id"])
  print c
  list[c] = row["name"]
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Ben</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-9):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Depending on how you are going to use the list, it may be that you actually want a dictionary.  This will work:</p>

<pre><code>d = {}

for row in rows:
  c = list_of_categories.index(row["id"])
  print c
  d[c] = row["name"]
</code></pre>

<p>... or more compactly:</p>

<pre><code>d = dict((list_of_categories.index(row['id']), row['name']) for row in rows)
print d
</code></pre>

<p>PHP arrays are much more like Python dicts than they are like Python lists.  For example, they can have strings for keys.</p>

<p>And confusingly, Python has an array module, which is described as "efficient arrays of numeric values", which is definitely not what you want.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>If the number of items you want is known in advance, and you want to access them using integer, 0-based, consecutive indices, you might try this:</p>

<pre><code>n = 3
array = n * [None]
print array
array[2] = 11
array[1] = 47
array[0] = 42
print array
</code></pre>

<p>This prints:</p>

<pre><code>[None, None, None]
[42, 47, 11]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Use the list constructor, and append your items, like this:</p>

<pre><code>l = list ()
l.append ("foo")
l.append (3)
print (l)
</code></pre>

<p>gives me <code>['foo', 3]</code>, which should be what you want. See the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html?highlight=list#list" rel="nofollow">documentation on list</a> and the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq" rel="nofollow">sequence type documentation</a>.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> Updated</p>

<p>For inserting, use <code>insert</code>, like this:</p>

<pre><code>l = list ()
l.append ("foo")
l.append (3)
l.insert (1, "new")
print (l)
</code></pre>

<p>which prints <code>['foo', 'new', 3]</code></p>

<p>You don't need to create empty lists with a specified length. You just add to them and query about their current length if needed. </p>

<p>What you can't do without preparing to catch an exception is to use a non existent index. Which is probably what you are used to in PHP.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You can use this syntax to create a list with <code>n</code> elements:</p>

<pre><code>lst = [0] * n
</code></pre>

<p>But be careful! The list will contain <code>n</code> copies of this object. If this object is mutable and you change one element, then all copies will be changed! In this case you should use:</p>

<pre><code>lst = [some_object() for i in xrange(n)]
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can access these elements:</p>

<pre><code>for i in xrange(n):
    lst[i] += 1
</code></pre>

<p>A Python list is comparable to a vector in other languages. It is a resizable array, not a linked list.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Sounds like what you need might be a <strong>dictionary</strong> rather than an array if you want to insert into specified indices.</p>

<pre><code>dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
dict['a']
</code></pre>

  <blockquote>
    <p>1</p>
  </blockquote>

<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I agree with ned that you probably need a dictionary for what you're trying to do. But here's a way to get a list of those lists of categories you can do this:</p>

<pre><code>lst = [list_of_categories.index(row["id"]) for row in rows]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>use a dictionary, because what you're really asking for is a structure you can access by arbitrary keys</p>

<pre><code>list = {}

for row in rows:
  c = list_of_categories.index(row["id"])
  print c
  list[c] = row["name"]
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can iterate through the known contents with:</p>

<pre><code>for x in list.values():
  print x
</code></pre>

<p>Or check if something exists in the "list":</p>

<pre><code>if 3 in list: 
  print "it's there"
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>I'm not sure if I understood what you mean or want to do, but it seems that you want a list which
is dictonary-like where the index is the key. Even if I think, the usage of a dictonary would be a better
choice, here's my answer: Got a problem - make an object:</p>

<pre><code>class MyList(UserList.UserList):

NO_ITEM = 'noitem'

def insertAt(self, item, index):

    length = len(self)
    if index &lt; length:
        self[index] = item
    elif index == length:
        self.append(item)
    else:
        for i in range(0, index-length):
            self.append(self.NO_ITEM)
        self.append(item)
</code></pre>

<p>Maybe some errors in the python syntax (didn't check), but in principle it should work.
 Of course the else case works also for the elif, but I thought, it might be a little harder
 to read this way.            </p>
