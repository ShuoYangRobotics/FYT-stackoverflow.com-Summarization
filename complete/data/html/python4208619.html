<h3>Question (ID-4208619):</h3><h2>Python function parameter: tuple/list</h2><p>My function expects a list or a tuple as a parameter. It doesn't really care which it is, all it does is pass it to another function that accepts either a list or tuple:</p>

<pre><code>def func(arg): # arg is tuple or list
  another_func(x)
  # do other stuff here
</code></pre>

<p>Now I need to modify the function slightly, to process an additional element:</p>

<pre><code>def func(arg): #arg is tuple or list
  another_func(x + ['a'])
  # etc
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately this is not going to work: if arg is tuple, I must say <code>x + ('a',)</code>.</p>

<p>Obviously, I can make it work by coercing arg to list. But it isn't neat.</p>

<p>Is there a better way of doing that? I can't force callers to always pass a tuple, of course, since it simply shifts to work to them.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-9):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>If <code>another_func</code> just wants a iterable you can pass <code>itertools.chain(x,'a')</code> to it.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>What about changing the other function to accept a list of params instead ?</p>

<pre><code>def func(arg): # arg is tuple or list
  another_func('a', *x)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>how about:</p>

<pre><code>l = ['a']
l.extend(x)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><pre><code>def f(*args):
    print args

def a(*args):
    k = list(args)
    k.append('a')
    f(*k)

a(1, 2, 3)
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>(1, 2, 3, 'a')
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>My suggestion:</p>

<pre><code>def foo(t):
    bar(list(t) + [other])
</code></pre>

<p>This is not very efficient though, you'd be better off passing around mutable things if you're going to be, well, mutating them.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You can use the type of the iterable passed to the first function to construct what you pass to the second:</p>

<pre><code>from itertools import chain

def func(iterable):
    it = iter(iterable)
    another_func(type(iterable)(chain(it, ('a',))))

def another_func(arg):
    print arg

func((1,2))
# (1, 2, 'a')
func([1,2])
# [1, 2, 'a']
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I think you have to clarify exactly which are the requirements of the two functions.
Must <em>arg</em> be a sequence, or an iterable is enough?</p>

<p>If an iterable is enough you can use itertools.chain, but be aware that if function A(the first one called), also iterates over the iterable after calling B, then you might have problems since iterables cannot be rewinded. In this case you should opt for a sequence or use iterable.tee to make a copy of the iterable:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import itertools as it
&gt;&gt;&gt; def A(iterable):
...     iterable, backup = it.tee(iterable)
...     res = B(it.chain(iterable, ('a',)))
...     #do something with res
...     for elem in backup:
...             #do something with elem
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; def B(iterable):
...     for elem in iterable:
...             #do something with elem
... 
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Have your function accept any iterable.  Then use <code>itertools.chain</code> to add whatever sequence you want to the iterable.</p>

<pre><code>from itertools import chain

def func(iterable):
    another_func(chain(iterable, ('a',)))
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>I'd say Santiago Lezica's answer of doing</p>

<pre><code>def foo(t):
    bar(list(t) + [other])
</code></pre>

<p>is the best because it is the simplest. (no need to import itertools stuff and use much less readable chain calls). But only use it if you expect t to be small. If t can be large you should use one of the other solutions. </p>
