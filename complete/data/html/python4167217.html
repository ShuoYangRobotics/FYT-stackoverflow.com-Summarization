<h3>Question (ID-4167217):</h3><h2>even numbers python list</h2><p>Working on an assignment. Can anyone help me get started by explaining how i can create a list and only extract or search out the even numbers in that list? </p>

<p>create a function even_only(l) that takes a list of integers as its only argument. The
function will return a new list containing all (and only) the elements of l which are evenly divisible by 2. The original list l shall remain unchanged.</p>

<p>For examples, even_only([1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28]) should return [6, 10, 28], and
even_only([1, 4, 9, 16, 25]) should return [4, 16].</p>

<p>Hint: Start by creating an empty list, and whenever you encounter an even number in l, add it to your list. At the end, return your list.</p>

<p>Thanks for your tme in explaining :)</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Simplest way would be to do what you posted in a comment -- iterate through the input list to find digits evenly divisible by 2, and add them to the return list if so.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow"><code>list.append(x)</code></a> function will help you add an item to a list.</p>

<p>Also as mentioned, look at using the <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/expressions.html#binary-arithmetic-operations" rel="nofollow">modulo</a> operation to determine if a number is divisible by 2...</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>"By hand":</p>

<pre><code>def even_only(lst):
    evens = []
    for number in lst:
        if is_even(number):
            evens.append(number)
    return evens
</code></pre>

<p>Pythonic:</p>

<pre><code>def even_only(iter):
    return [x for x in iter if is_even(x)]
</code></pre>

<p>Since it's homework, you can fill in the <code>is_even</code> function.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>The best way to do this (as a beginner) is probably a comprehension list. Since this is a homework, I won't do it for you, but here is the syntax :</p>

<pre><code>[x for x in your_list if (your condition)]
</code></pre>

<p>You just have to replace (your condition) with what fits well (basically, exactly what you described).</p>

<p>P.S. I know some people may say comprehension lists are a bit advanced for a beginner, but I think it is not a concept too hard to catch and extremely useful.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; even_only = lambda seq : [ x for x in seq if str(x)[-1] in "02468" ]
&gt;&gt;&gt; even_only([1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28])
[6, 10, 28]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Use the <code>filter</code> function to do this in a functional way:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; even_filter = lambda x: not x % 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; result = filter(even_filter, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
&gt;&gt;&gt; assert result == [0, 2, 4]
</code></pre>

<p>Edit: updated with the correct parity of zero per Vincent's comment.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = [i for i in a if i%2 ==0 ]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b
[6, 10, 28]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
[1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28]
</code></pre>
