<h3>Question (ID-2034517):</h3><h2>Python's interpretation of tabs and spaces to indent</h2><p>I decided, that I learn a bit of Python. The first introduction says that it uses indentation to group statements. While the best habit is clearly to use just one of these what happens if I interchange them? How many spaces will be considered equal to one tab? Or will it fail to work at all if tabs and spaces are mixed?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Follow <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow">PEP 8</a> for Python style. PEP 8 says:
  Indentation</p>

<pre><code>Use 4 spaces per indentation level.

For really old code that you don't want to mess up, you can continue to
use 8-space tabs.
</code></pre>

<p>Tabs or Spaces?</p>

<pre><code>Never mix tabs and spaces.

The most popular way of indenting Python is with spaces only.  The
second-most popular way is with tabs only.  Code indented with a mixture
of tabs and spaces should be converted to using spaces exclusively.  When
invoking the Python command line interpreter with the -t option, it issues
warnings about code that illegally mixes tabs and spaces.  When using -tt
these warnings become errors.  These options are highly recommended!
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Spaces are not treated as equivalent to tab.  A line indented with a tab is at a different indentation from a line indented with 1, 2, 4 <s>or 8</s> spaces.</p>

<p>Proof by counter-example (<em>erroneous, or, at best, limited - tab != 4 spaces</em>):</p>

<pre><code>x = 1
if x == 1:
^Iprint "fff\n"
    print "yyy\n"
</code></pre>

<p>The '<code>^I</code>' shows a <kbd>TAB</kbd>.  When run through Python 2.5, I get the error:</p>

<pre><code>  File "xx.py", line 4
    print "yyy\n"
                ^
IndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level
</code></pre>

<p>Thus showing that in Python 2.5, tabs are not equal to spaces (and in particular not equal to 4 spaces).</p>

<hr>

<p>Oops - embarrassing; my proof by counter-example shows that tabs are not equivalent to 4 spaces.  As Alex Martelli points out in a comment, tabs are equivalent to 8 spaces, and adapting the example with a tab and 8 spaces shows that this is indeed the case.</p>

<pre><code>x = 1
if x != 1:
^Iprint "x is not 1\n"
        print "y is unset\n"
</code></pre>

<p>This code works, printing nothing.</p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I would recommend that you go through <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow">http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/</a> which is the 'official' python style guide for Python code. It covers (among other things) the use of tabs/spaces.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Just don't interchange them :)<br>
Set your IDE/editor to input 4 spaces upon pressing "tab" and you are good to go.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I believe that the tab character should simply never appear in source code under any circumstances. There's no advantage to it and it's an endless source of tiny errors.   - use a character string with \t if you need a tab, it has the advantage that it's self-documenting. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/tabs-vs-spaces.html" rel="nofollow">Here</a>'s the classic article about tabs vs spaces - I use a variant of jwz's elisp in my own .emacs file.</p>

<p>(I confess to personally breaking with PEP 8 by using only 2 characters' indentation - 4 characters is a lot when your lines are only 80 characters...)</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>4 spaces are one tab ( in my setup )
but as far as i know, they are not intercahnged. you can use either spaces or tabs. not both.</p>
