<h3>Question (ID-5366513):</h3><h2>splitting merged words in python</h2><p>I am working with a text where all "\n"s have been deleted (which merges two words into one, like "I like bananasAnd this is a new line.And another one.") What I would like to do now is tell Python to look for combinations of a small letter followed by capital letter/punctuation followed by capital letter and insert a whitespace.</p>

<p>I thought this would be easy with reg. expressions, but it is not - I couldnt find an "insert" function or anything, and the string commands seem not to be helpful either. How do I do this?
Any help would be greatly appreciated, I am despairing over here...</p>

<p>Thanks, patrick</p>

<pre><code>re.sub(r"([a-z\.!?])([A-Z])", r"\1 \2", your_string)
</code></pre>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>import re
lines = "I like bananasAnd this is a new line.And another one."
print re.sub(r"([a-z\.!?])([A-Z])", r"\1 \2", lines)
# I like bananas And this is a new line. And another one.
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to insert a newline instead of a space, change the replacement to <code>r"\1\n\2"</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Using <code>re.sub</code> you should be able to make a pattern that grabs a lowercase and uppercase letter and substitutes them for the same two letters, but with a space in between:</p>

<pre><code>import re
re.sub(r'([a-z][.?]?)([A-Z])', '\\1\n\\2', mystring)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You're looking for the <code>sub</code> function. See <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/re.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/library/re.html</a> for documentation.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Hmm, interesting. You can use regular expressions to replace text with the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/re.html#re.sub" rel="nofollow"><code>sub()</code> function</a>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import re
&gt;&gt;&gt; string = 'fooBar'
&gt;&gt;&gt; re.sub(r'([a-z][.!?]*)([A-Z])', r'\1 \2', string)
'foo Bar'
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>If you really don't have any caps except at the beginning of a sentence, it will probably be easiest to just loop through the string.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import string
&gt;&gt;&gt; s = "a word endsA new sentence"
&gt;&gt;&gt; lastend = 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; sentences = list()
&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(0, len(s)):
...    if s[i] in string.uppercase:
...        sentences.append(s[lastend:i])
...        lastend = i
&gt;&gt;&gt; sentences.append(s[lastend:])
&gt;&gt;&gt; print sentences
['a word ends', 'A new sentence']
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Here's another approach, which avoids regular expressions and does not use any imported libraries, just built-ins...</p>

<pre><code>s = "I like bananasAnd this is a new line.And another one."
with_whitespace = ''
last_was_upper = True
for c in s:
    if c.isupper():
        if not last_was_upper:
            with_whitespace += ' '
        last_was_upper = True
    else:
        last_was_upper = False
    with_whitespace += c

print with_whitespace
</code></pre>

<p>Yields:</p>

<pre><code>I like bananas And this is a new line. And another one.
</code></pre>
