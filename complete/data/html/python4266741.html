<h3>Question (ID-4266741):</h3><h2>Check if a number is rational in Python</h2><p>I would like to know a good way of checking if a number x is a rational (two integers n,m exist so that x=n/m) in python.</p>

<p>In mathematica, this is done by the function</p>

<pre><code>Rationalize[6.75]
27/4
</code></pre>

<p>I assume this question has an answer for a given accuracy.
Is there a common algorithm of obtaining these two integers?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>In python >= 2.6 there is a <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#float.as_integer_ratio" rel="nofollow"><code>as_integer_ratio</code></a> method on floats:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 6.75
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.as_integer_ratio()
(27, 4)
&gt;&gt;&gt; import math
&gt;&gt;&gt; math.pi.as_integer_ratio()
(884279719003555, 281474976710656)
</code></pre>

<p>However, due to the way floats are defined in programming languages <em>there are no irrational numbers</em>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Any number with a finite decimal expansion is a rational number. You could always solve for instance</p>

<pre><code>5.195181354985216
</code></pre>

<p>by saying that it corresponds to </p>

<pre><code>5195181354985216 / 1000000000000000
</code></pre>

<p>So since floats and doubles have finite precision they're all rationals.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>The nature of floating-point numbers means that it makes no sense to <em>check</em> if a floating-point number is rational, since all floating-point numbers are really fractions of the form <em>n</em> / 2<sup><em>e</em></sup>. However, you might well want to know whether there is a <em>simple</em> fraction (one with a small denominator rather than a big power of 2) that closely approximates a given floating-point number.</p>

<p>Donald Knuth discusses this latter problem in <em>The Art of Computer Programming</em> volume II. See the answer to exercise 4.53-39.  The idea is to search for the fraction with the lowest denominator within a range, by expanding the endpoints of the range as continued fractions so long as their coefficients are equal, and then when they differ, take the simplest value between them. Here's a fairly straightforward implementation in Python:</p>

<pre><code>from fractions import Fraction
from math import modf

def simplest_fraction_in_interval(x, y):
    """Return the fraction with the lowest denominator in [x,y]."""
    if x == y:
        # The algorithm will not terminate if x and y are equal.
        raise ValueError("Equal arguments.")
    elif x &lt; 0 and y &lt; 0:
        # Handle negative arguments by solving positive case and negating.
        return -simplest_fraction_in_interval(-y, -x)
    elif x &lt;= 0 or y &lt;= 0:
        # One argument is 0, or arguments are on opposite sides of 0, so
        # the simplest fraction in interval is 0 exactly.
        return Fraction(0)
    else:
        # Remainder and Coefficient of continued fractions for x and y.
        xr, xc = modf(1/x);
        yr, yc = modf(1/y);
        if xc &lt; yc:
            return Fraction(1, int(xc) + 1)
        elif yc &lt; xc:
            return Fraction(1, int(yc) + 1)
        else:
            return 1 / (int(xc) + simplest_fraction_in_interval(xr, yr))

def approximate_fraction(x, e):
    """Return the fraction with the lowest denominator that differs
    from x by no more than e."""
    return simplest_fraction_in_interval(x - e, x + e)
</code></pre>

<p>And here are some results:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; approximate_fraction(6.75, 0.01)
Fraction(27, 4)
&gt;&gt;&gt; approximate_fraction(math.pi, 0.00001)
Fraction(355, 113)
&gt;&gt;&gt; approximate_fraction((1 + math.sqrt(5)) / 2, 0.00001)
Fraction(377, 233)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Python uses floating-point representation rather than rational numbers. Take a look at <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/fractions.html" rel="nofollow">the standard library <code>fractions</code> module</a> for some details about rational numbers.</p>

<p>Observe, for example, this, to see why it goes wrong:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from fractions import Fraction
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1.1  # Uh oh.
1.1000000000000001
&gt;&gt;&gt; Fraction(1.1)  # Will only work in &gt;= Python 2.7, anyway.
Fraction(2476979795053773, 2251799813685248)
&gt;&gt;&gt; Fraction(*1.1.as_integer_ratio())  # Python 2.6 compatible
Fraction(2476979795053773, 2251799813685248)
</code></pre>

<p>(Oh, you want to see a case where it works?)</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; Fraction('1.1')
Fraction(11, 10)
</code></pre>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>As you noted any floating point number can be converted to a rational number by moving the decimal point and dividing by the appropriate power of ten.</p>

<p>You can then remove the greatest common divisor from the dividend and divisor and check if both of these numbers fit in the data type of your choice.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>The problem with real numbers in programming languages is that they are usually defined as functions returning a finite representation given an accuracy (eg. a function which takes n as an argument and returns a floating point number within 2^-n accuracy).</p>

<p>You can definitely turn a rational/integer into a real, but even comparing reals for equality is undecidable (it is essentially the halting problem).</p>

<p>You cannot tell whether a real number x is rational: even in mathematics, it is usually difficult, since you have to find p and q such that x = p/q, and this is often non constructive.</p>

<p>However, given an accuracy window, you can find the "best" rational approximation for this accuracy using for instance continuous fraction expansion. I believe that is essentially what mathematica does. But in your exemple, 6.75 is already rational. Try with Pi instead.</p>
