<h3>Question (ID-1103685):</h3><h2>How to match search strings to content in python</h2><p>Usually when we search, we have a list of stories, we provide a search string, and expect back a list of results where the given search strings matches the story.</p>

<p>What i am looking to do, is the opposite. Give a list of search strings, and one story and find out which search strings match to that story.</p>

<p>Now this could be done with re but the case here is i wanna use complex search queries as supported by solr. Full details of the <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/java/2%5F4%5F0/queryparsersyntax.html" rel="nofollow">query syntax here</a>.  Note: i wont use boost.</p>

<p>Basically i want to get some pointers for the doesitmatch function in the sample code below.</p>

<pre><code>def doesitmatch(contents, searchstring):
    """
    returns result of searching contents for searchstring (True or False)
    """
    ???????
    ???????


story = "big chunk of story 200 to 1000 words long"
searchstrings = ['sajal' , 'sajal AND "is a jerk"' , 'sajal kayan' , 'sajal AND (kayan OR bangkok OR Thailand OR ( webmaster AND python))' , 'bangkok']

matches = [[searchstr] for searchstr in searchstrings if doesitmatch(story, searchstr) ]
</code></pre>

<p>Edit: Additionally would also be interested to know if any module exists to convert lucene query like 'sajal AND (kayan OR bangkok OR Thailand OR ( webmaster AND python) OR "is a jerk")' into regex</p>

<p>Found the code that makes regex boolean aware : <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/252526/" rel="nofollow">http://code.activestate.com/recipes/252526/</a></p>

<p>Issue looks solved for now.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Probably slow, but easy solution:</p>

<p>Make a query on the story plus each string to the search engine. If it returns anything, then it matches.</p>

<p>Otherwise you need to implement the search syntax yourself. If that includes things like "title:" and stuff this can be rather complex. If it's only the AND and OR from your example, then it's a recursive function that isn't too hairy.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Some time ago I looked for a python implementaion of lucene and I came accross of <a href="http://whoosh.ca/" rel="nofollow">Woosh</a> which is a pure python text-based research engine. Maybe it will statisfy your needs.</p>

<p>You can also try <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/pylucene/" rel="nofollow">pyLucene</a>, but i did'nt investigate this one.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Here's a suggestion in pseudocode. I'm assuming you store a story identifier with the search terms in the index, so that you can retrieve it with the search results.</p>

<pre><code>def search_strings_matching(story_id_to_match, search_strings):
    result = set()
    for s in search_strings:
        result_story_ids = query_index(s) # query_index returns an id iterable
        if story_id_to_match in result_story_ids:
            result.add(s)
    return result
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>This is probably less interesting to you now, since you've already solved your problem, but what you're describing sounds like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective%5Fsearch" rel="nofollow">Prospective Search</a>, which is what you call it when you have the query first and you want to match it against documents as they come along.</p>

<p>Lucene's <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/java/2%5F4%5F0/api/org/apache/lucene/index/memory/MemoryIndex.html" rel="nofollow">MemoryIndex</a> is a class that was designed specifically for something like this, and in your case it might be efficient enough to run many queries against a single document.</p>

<p>This has nothing to do with Python, though. You'd probably be better off writing something like this in java.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>If you are writing Python on AppEngine, you can use the AppEngine Prospective Search Service to achieve exactly what you are trying to do here.
