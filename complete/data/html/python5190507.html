<h3>Question (ID-5190507):</h3><h2>How do I grep for words coming from a file in files listed in a file?</h2><p>Searching a single file for a word is easy:</p>

<pre><code>grep stuff file.txt
</code></pre>

<p>But I have many files, each is a line in <code>files.txt</code>, and many words I want to find, each is a line in <code>words.txt</code>.  The output should be a file with each line <code>a =&gt; b</code> with <code>a</code> being the line number in <code>words.txt</code>, <code>b</code> being the line number in <code>files.txt</code>.</p>

<p>I need to run it on OSX, so preferably something simple in shell, but any other language would be fine.  I haven't had much experience with shell scripts myself, and I'm more used to languages that aren't useful for string searching (namely C - I'm guessing Perl or Python may be helpful, but I've not used them).</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>First, learn to specify the files of interest. In one directory or more than one directory? The Unix <code>find</code> utility will do that. </p>

<p>At the Bash prompt:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd [the root directory where your files are]
$ find . -name "*.txt"
</code></pre>

<p>You did not say, but assumably the files are describable with "star dot something" then find will find the files.</p>

<p>Next, pipe the files names to what you want to do to them:</p>

<pre><code>$ find . -name "*.txt" -print0 | xargs -0 egrep 'stuff'
</code></pre>

<p>That will run <code>egrep</code> on each file with the search pattern of <code>stuff</code>   </p>

<p>Google <code>find</code> plus <code>xargs</code> for literally thousands of examples. Once you are comfortable finding the files -- rephrase your question so that it is a bit more obvious what you want to do to them. Then I can help you with Perl to do it. </p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You might this to be faster, more Pythonic, and easier to understand:</p>

<pre><code>with open("words.txt") as words:
    wlist=[(ln,word.strip()) for ln,word in enumerate(words,1)]

with open("files.txt") as files:
    flist=[(ln,file.strip()) for ln,file in enumerate(files,1)]

for filenum, filename in flist:
    with open(filename) as fdata:
        for fln,line in enumerate(fdata,1):
            for wln, word in wlist:
                if word in line:
                    print "%d =&gt; %d" % (wln, fln)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>This is a two-parter with awk:
1. scan each file in files.txt, and map the word number to the name of the file
2. map the filename to the line number in files.txt</p>

<pre><code>awk '
  NR == FNR {word[$1] = NR; next}
  {for (i=1; i&lt;=NF; i++) {if ($i in word) {print word[$i] " =&gt; " FILENAME; break}}}
' words.txt $(&lt;files.txt) | 
sort -u |
awk '
  NR == FNR {filenum[$1] = NR; next}
  {$3 = filenum[$3]; print}
' files.txt -
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Here's something that will do what you want, but the only thing is that it will <strong>not</strong> print out the matched word, instead just prints out the line matched, the file name, and the line number. However, if you use <code>--color=auto</code> on grep, it will highlight the matched words using whatever you have set in <code>${GREP_COLOR}</code>, the default is red.</p>

<pre><code>cat files.txt | xargs grep -nf words.txt --color=auto
</code></pre>

<p>This command will dump all contents of <code>files.txt</code>, line by line, and it will pipe the file names to grep, which will search the file for every word that matches in <code>words.txt</code>. Similar to <code>files.txt</code>, <code>words.txt</code> should be all the search terms you want delimited by new-lines.</p>

<p>If your grep was built with the perl regular expression engine, then, you can use Perl regular expressions if you pass the <code>-P</code> option to grep like so:</p>

<pre><code>grep -Pnf words.txt --color=auto
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Update: At first, I wasn't really sure what @Zeophlite was asking but after he posted his example, I see what he wanted. Here's a python implementation of what he wants to do:</p>

<pre><code>from contextlib import nested


def search_file(line_num, filename):
    with nested(open(filename), open('words.txt')) as managers:
        open_filename, word_file = managers
        for line in open_filename:
            for wordfile_line_number, word in enumerate(word_file, 1):
                if word.strip() in line:
                    print "%s =&gt; %s" % (line_num, wordfile_line_number)


with open('files.txt') as filenames_file:
    for filenames_line_number, fname in enumerate(filenames_file, 1):
        search_file(filenames_line_number, fname.strip())
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>The following script in python does it.  This is my first attempt at python, so I'd appreciate any comments</p>

<pre><code>flist = open('files.txt')

filenum = 0
for filename in flist:
    filenum = filenum + 1
    filenamey = filename.strip()
    filedata = open(filenamey)
    for fline in filedata:
        wordnum = 0
        wlist = open('words.txt')
        for word in wlist:
            wordnum = wordnum + 1
            sword = word.strip()
            if sword in fline:
                s = repr(filenum) + ' =&gt; ' + repr(wordnum)
                print s
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>To answer your demand</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>Your code:</p>

<pre><code>flist = open('files.txt') 

filenum = 0 
for filename in flist: 
    filenum = filenum + 1 
    filenamey = filename.strip() 
    filedata = open(filenamey) 
    for fline in filedata: 
        wordnum = 0 
        wlist = open('words.txt') 
        for word in wlist: 
            wordnum = wordnum + 1 
            sword = word.strip() 
            if sword in fline: 
                s = repr(filenum) + ' =&gt; ' + repr(wordnum) 
                print s 
</code></pre>

<p>You open <strong>'files.txt'</strong> but don't close it.
<code>with open('files.txt') as flist:</code> is preferable because it is textually cleaner and it manages to close alone.</p>

<p>Instead of <code>filenum = filenum + 1</code> , use <code>enumerate()</code><br>
From now, you must never forget <code>enumerate()</code> because it is an extremely useful function. It works very very fast, too.</p>

<p><strong>fline</strong> isn't a good name for an iterator of lines, IMO; Isn't <strong>line</strong> a good one ?</p>

<p>The instruction <code>wlist = open('words.txt')</code> isn't in a good place: it is executed not only each for each file opened, but even each time a line is analysed.
Moreover, the treatment of the names listed in <strong>wlist</strong> is performed each time the <strong>wlist</strong> is iterated, that is to say at each line. You must put this treatment out of all the iterations.</p>

<p><strong>wordnum</strong> is nothing else than the index of <strong>word</strong> in <strong>wlist</strong>. You can use again <code>enumerate()</code> or simply loop with index <strong>i</strong> and use <code>wlist[i]</code> instead of <strong>word</strong></p>

<p>Each time a <strong>sword</strong> of <strong>wlist</strong> is in the line, you do </p>

<pre><code>print repr(filenum) + ' =&gt; ' + repr(wordnum) 
</code></pre>

<p>It would be better to do <code>print repr(filenum) + ' =&gt; ' + repr(all_wordnum)</code> in which <code>all_wordnum</code> would be the list of all the <strong>sword</strong> found in one line</p>

<p>You keep your list of words in a file. You'd better serialise the list of this words. See the modules <strong>pickle</strong> and <strong>pickle</strong></p>

<p>There is also something to improve in the recording of result. Because executing the instruction </p>

<pre><code>print repr(filenum) + ' =&gt; ' + repr(wordnum)
</code></pre>

<p>each time is not a good practice. It's the same if you want to record in a file: you can't repeatedly order <code>write()</code> Better is to list all the result in a list, and print or record when process is over, making <code>"\n".join(list)</code> or something like that</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Doing it in pure shell, I'm close:</p>

<pre><code>$ grep -n $(tr '\n' '|' &lt; words.txt | sed 's/|$//') $(cat files.txt)
</code></pre>

<p>(Tried to figure out how to remove the <code>$(cat files.txt)</code>, but couldn't)</p>

<p>This prints out the words in each file, and prints out the lines where they occur, but it doesn't print out the line in <code>words.txt</code> where that word was located.</p>

<p>There's probably some really ugly (if you didn't think this was ugly enough) stuff I could do, but your real answer is to use a higher level language. The <code>awk</code> solution is <code>shellish</code> since most people now consider <code>awk</code> as just part of the Unix environment. However, if you're using <code>awk</code>, you might as well use <code>perl</code>, <code>python</code>, or <code>ruby</code>. </p>

<p>The only advantage <code>awk</code> has is that it is automatically included in a Linux/Unix distro even if the user who created the distro didn't include any of the development packages. It's rare, but it happens.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>A pure <code>sh</code> answer, assuming that words or filenames do not contain any shell metacharacters such as blanks:</p>

<pre><code>nw=0; while read w; do nw=`expr $nw + 1`; nf=0; { while read f; do nf=`expr $nf + 1`; fgrep -n $w $f | sed 's/:.*//' | while read n; do echo $nw =\&gt; $nf; done; done &lt; /tmp/files.txt;}; done &lt; /tmp/words.txt
</code></pre>

<p>But I prefer Perl for this kind of thing.
And the Perl script won't be quite as short or readable as carrrot-top's Python code, unless you use <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/2004/03/12/ioall.html" rel="nofollow">IO::All</a>.</p>
