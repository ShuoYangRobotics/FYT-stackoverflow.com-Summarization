<h3>Question (ID-401025):</h3><h2>Define css class in django Forms</h2><p>Assume I have a form</p>

<pre><code>class SampleClass(forms.Form):
    name = forms.CharField(max_length=30)
    age = forms.IntegerField()
    django_hacker = forms.BooleanField(required=False)
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a way for me to define css classes on each field such that I can then use jQuery based on class in my rendered page?</p>

<p>I was hoping not to have to manually build the form.</p>

<p>I didn't realize it was passed into the widget constructor.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Here is another solution for adding class definitions to the widgets after declaring the fields in the class.</p>

<pre><code>def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
    super(SampleClass, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
    self.fields['name'].widget.attrs['class'] = 'my_class'
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Yet another solution that doesn't require changes in python code and so is better for designers and one-off presentational changes: <a href="https://bitbucket.org/kmike/django-widget-tweaks">https://bitbucket.org/kmike/django-widget-tweaks</a> . Hope somebody will find it useful.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Here is Simple way to alter in view. add below in view just before passing it into template.</p>

<pre><code>form = MyForm(instance = instance.obj)
form.fields['email'].widget.attrs = {'class':'here_class_name'}
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Here is a variation on the above which will give all fields the same class (e.g. jquery nice rounded corners).</p>

<pre><code>  # Simple way to assign css class to every field
  def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
    super(TranslatedPageForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
    for myField in self.fields:
      self.fields[myField].widget.attrs['class'] = 'ui-state-default ui-corner-all'
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Expanding on the method pointed to at docs.djangoproject.com:</p>

<pre><code>class MyForm(forms.Form): 
    comment = forms.CharField(
            widget=forms.TextInput(attrs={'size':'40'}))
</code></pre>

<p>I thought it was troublesome to have to know the native widget type for every field, and thought it funny to override the default just to put a class name on a form field.  This seems to work for me:</p>

<pre><code>class MyForm(forms.Form): 
    #This instantiates the field w/ the default widget
    comment = forms.CharField()

    #We only override the part we care about
    comment.widget.attrs['size'] = '40'
</code></pre>

<p>This seems a little cleaner to me.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I'm not really familiar wit jQuery, but I do know that Firefox (and thus any good browser) will render CSS for any element that has CSS and exists in the HTML. In other words, I can make the following:</p>

<p>&lt;</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form&gt;
&lt;name&gt;Name:&lt;input type="text" /&gt;&lt;/name&gt;
&lt;age&gt;Age:&lt;input type="text" /&gt;&lt;/age&gt;
&lt;favcolor&gt;Favorite Color:&lt;input type="text" /&gt;&lt;favcolor&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And then have my css, instead of written to modify a class/id, can be written to modify anything inside that element. Like:</p>

<pre><code>name {
color: black;
}

name input {
background-color: yellow;
border: 3px dotted black;
}
</code></pre>
