<h3>Question (ID-59115):</h3><h2>A good Ruby book (that resembles Dive into Python)</h2><p>Anyone came across something like <em>Dive Into Python</em> for Ruby? Something that:</p>

<ol>
<li>Gets the language knowledge across by examples of real code that does something useful not just trivial one-liners</li>
<li>Is ment for experienced programmers, not newbies (i.e. does not explain obvious stuff like object-orientation and what is a instance vs. class variable)</li>
<li>starts with simple stuff and continues onto the really Ruby cutting-edge features like metaprogramming etc.</li>
<li>Is fun to read</li>
</ol>

<p>Please do <strong>not</strong> answer <strong><em>"pickaxe"</em></strong>, since this is clearly nothing like Dive...</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>No mention of The Well Grounded Rubyist (Manning) by David A Black (his pure Ruby follow up to Ruby for Rails). I have only skimmed it myself, but I hear good reports from it.</p>

<p>I enjoyed his writing style in Ruby for Rails, and it was an early good example of metaprogramming in print. I am assuming more of the same in the Well Grounded Rubyist. Much of the early book is introductory material however.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I've read and like: </p>

<p>Programming Ruby: The Pragmatic Programmer's Guide</p>

<p>Great reference, I need to purchase a copy so I have it on my desk (previously read at a former employer).</p>

<p>The Ruby Way</p>

<p>I just finished reading this. Well, not cover to cover, more like reading through. Great collection of code snips and an excellent reference as well.</p>

<p>Ruby Pocket Reference</p>

<p>As I'm still really learning Ruby syntactically, I use this quite often.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>David Black's Ruby for Rails is a very good Ruby intro, especially if you have any exposure to Rails.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>While it is basic in the beginning I think Beginning Ruby by Peter Cooper is a good starting point for Ruby.</p>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You want the <a href="http://www.rubycentral.com/book/" rel="nofollow">Pragmatic Programmers Guide to Programming Ruby</a>.  Freely available to you online and a superbly written book.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>@<a href="#59214" rel="nofollow">Prestaul </a>- this is the pickaxe and it is <em>not</em> what I'm looking for.</p>

<p>@J.F. and Duke - I'll take a look at the ones you're suggesting and evaluate them. Thanks</p>

<p><em>I do own a copy of the pickaxe - it is just more a reference than a programmer's book. Why's poignant guide is good writing and hillarious but just doesn't get enough information across (since it is hardly a programmer's book)</em></p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>There is a thread <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22873/language-bookstutorials-for-popular-languages" rel="nofollow">here</a> that describes books/online tutorials for popular languages.  If you guys don't mind, could you put your suggestions there?</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.manning.com/black2/" rel="nofollow">"Well Grounded Rubyist by David Black"</a> meets your four criteria.</p>

<p>The book covers Ruby 1.9 fairly well.</p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p><strong>Metaprogramming</strong> - Its really difficult to get your head out of the 'class of an object cannot change/mutate' illusion if you come from a conventional c/java route. You may want to take a look at this <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/screencasts/v-dtrubyom/the-ruby-object-model-and-metaprogramming" rel="nofollow">Prag Prog screencast series</a> (5 bucks an episode) Still @ Episode1, so will let you know in a few days. So far its good.</p>

<p><em>Well the pickaxe is how I learnt my Ruby (not a pro though) and I still believe you should get a copy for your desk - its unbelievable handy as a reference. Thanks for flagging DiveIntoPython - a new post it on my to-read list</em></p>
