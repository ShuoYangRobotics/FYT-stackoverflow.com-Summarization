<h3>Question (ID-214059):</h3><h2>How can I write a wrapper around ngrep that highlights matches?</h2><p>I just learned about <a href="http://ngrep.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">ngrep</a>, a cool program that lets you easily sniff packets that match a particular string.</p>

<p>The only problem is that it can be hard to see the match in the big blob of output. I'd like to write a wrapper script to highlight these matches -- it could use ANSI escape sequences:</p>

<pre><code>echo -e 'This is \e[31mRED\e[0m.'
</code></pre>

<p>I'm most familiar with Perl, but I'm perfectly happy with a solution in Python or any other language. The simplest approach would be something like:</p>

<pre><code>while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) {
   s/$keyword/\e[31m$keyword\e[0m/g;
   print;
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, this isn't a nice solution, because ngrep prints out hash marks without newlines whenever it receives a non-matching packet, and the code above will suppress the printing of these hashmarks until the script sees a newline.</p>

<p>Is there any way to do the highlighting without inhibiting the instant appearance of the hashmarks?</p>

<pre><code>#! /usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;

$| = 1; # autoflush on

my $keyword = shift or die "No pattern specified\n";
my $cache   = '';

while (read STDIN, my $ch, 1) {
    if ($ch eq '#') {
        $cache =~ s/($keyword)/\e[31m$1\e[0m/g;
        syswrite STDOUT, "$cache$ch";
        $cache = '';
    }
    else {
        $cache .= $ch;
    }
}

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You could also pipe the output through <a href="http://petdance.com/ack/" rel="nofollow">ack</a>.  The --passthru flag will help.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Ah, forget it. This is too much of a pain. It was a lot easier to get the source to ngrep and make it print the hash marks to stderr:</p>

     }

     if (quiet &lt; 1) {
-        printf("#");
-        fflush(stdout);
+      fprintf (stderr, "#");
     }

     switch (ip_proto) {
</code></pre>

<p>Then, filtering is a piece of cake:</p>

<pre><code>while (&lt;CMD&gt;) {
  s/($keyword)/\e[93m$1\e[0m/g;
  print;
}
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>It shouldn't be too hard if you have the answer <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/213901/in-perl-how-do-i-process-input-as-soon-as-it-arrives-instead-of-waiting-for-new">this question</a>.</p>

<p>(Essentially, read one character at a time and if it's a hash, print it.  If it isn't a hash, save the character to print out later.)</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>This is easy in python.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys, re

keyword = 'RED'

while 1:
    c = sys.stdin.read(1)
    if not c:
        break
    if c in '#\n':
        sys.stdout.write(c)
    else:
        sys.stdout.write(
            (c+sys.stdin.readline()).replace(
            keyword, '\x1b[31m%s\x1b[0m\r' % keyword))
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>why not just call ngrep with the -q parameter to eliminate the hash marks?</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>See the script at <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-il@cs.huji.ac.il/msg52876.html" rel="nofollow">this post to Linux-IL where someone asked a similar question</a>. It's written in Perl and uses the CPAN Term::ANSIColor module.</p>
