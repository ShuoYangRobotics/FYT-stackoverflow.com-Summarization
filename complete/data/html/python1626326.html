<h3>Question (ID-1626326):</h3><h2>How to manage local vs production settings in Django?</h2><p>A Django newbie question:<br />
What is the recommended way of handling settings for local development and the production server? Some of them (like Constants, etc) can be changed/accessed in both, but some of them (like paths to static files) need to remain different, and hence should not be overwritten everytime the new code is deployed...</p>

<p>Currently, I am adding all constants to settings.py. But every time I change some constant locally, I have to copy it to the production server and edit the file for production specific changes... :( </p>

<pre><code>try:
   from local_settings import *
except ImportError, e:
   pass
</code></pre>

<p>You can override what needed in local_settings.py; it should stay out of your version control then. But since you mention copying I'm guessing you use none ;)</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I use a settings_local.py and a settings_production.py. After trying several options I've found that it's easy to waste time with complex solutions when simply having two settings files feels easy and fast.</p>

<p>When you use mod_python/mod_wsgi for your Django project you need to point it to your settings file. If you point it to app/settings_local.py on your local server and app/settings_production.py on your production server then life becomes easy. Just edit the appropriate settings file and restart the server (Django development server will restart automatically).</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I use a slightly modified version of the "if DEBUG" style of settings that Harper Shelby posted.  Obviously depending on the environment (win/linux/etc.) the code might need to be tweaked a bit.</p>

<p>I was in the past using the "if DEBUG" but I found that occasionally I needed to do testing with DEUBG set to False.  What I really wanted to distinguish if the environment was production or development, which gave me the freedom to choose the DEBUG level.</p>

<pre><code>PRODUCTION_SERVERS = ['WEBSERVER1','WEBSERVER2',]
if os.environ['COMPUTERNAME'] in PRODUCTION_SERVERS:
    PRODUCTION = True
else:
    PRODUCTION = False

DEBUG = not PRODUCTION
TEMPLATE_DEBUG = DEBUG

# ...

if PRODUCTION:
    DATABASE_HOST = '192.168.1.1'
else:
    DATABASE_HOST = 'localhost'
</code></pre>

<p>I'd still consider this way of settings a work in progress. I haven't seen any one way to handling Django settings that covered all the bases and at the same time wasn't a total hassle to setup (I'm not down with the 5x settings files methods).</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Remember that settings.py is a live code file. Assuming that you don't have DEBUG set on production (which is a best practice), you can do something like:</p>

<pre><code>if DEBUG:
    STATIC_PATH = /path/to/dev/files
else:
    STATIC_PATH = /path/to/production/files
</code></pre>

<p>Pretty basic, but you could, in theory, go up to any level of complexity based on just the value of DEBUG - or any other variable or code check you wanted to use.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>My solution to that problem is also somewhat of a mix of some solutions already stated here:</p>

<ul>
<li>I keep a file called <code>local_settings.py</code> that has the content <code>USING_LOCAL = True</code> in dev and <code>USING_LOCAL = False</code> in prod</li>
<li>In <code>settings.py</code> I do an import on that file to get the <code>USING_LOCAL</code> setting</li>
</ul>

<p>I then base all my environment-dependent settings on that one:</p>

<pre><code>DEBUG = USING_LOCAL
if USING_LOCAL:
    # dev database settings
else:
    # prod database settings
</code></pre>

<p>I prefer this to having two separate settings.py files that I need to maintain as I can keep my settings structured in a single file easier than having them spread across several files. Like this, when I update a setting I don't forget to do it for both environments.</p>

<p>Of course that every method has its disadvantages and this one is no exception. The problem here is that I can't overwrite the <code>local_settings.py</code> file whenever I push my changes into production, meaning I can't just copy all files blindly, but that's something I can live with.</p>

<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I use a variation of what jpartogi mentioned above, that I find a little shorter:</p>

<pre><code>import platform
from django.core.management import execute_manager 

computername = platform.node()

try:
  settings = __import__(computername + '_settings')
except ImportError: 
  import sys
  sys.stderr.write("Error: Can't find the file '%r_settings.py' in the directory containing %r. It appears you've customized things.\nYou'll have to run django-admin.py, passing it your settings module.\n(If the file local_settings.py does indeed exist, it's causing an ImportError somehow.)\n" % (computername, __file__))
  sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
  execute_manager(settings)
</code></pre>

<p>Basically on each computer (development or production) I have the appropriate hostname_settings.py file that gets dynamically loaded.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>I differentiate it in manage.py and created two separate settings file: local_settings.py and prod_settings.py. </p>

<p>In manage.py I check whether the server is local server or production server. If it is a local server it would load up local_settings.py and it is a production server it would load up prod_settings.py. Basically this is how it would look like:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys
import socket
from django.core.management import execute_manager 

ipaddress = socket.gethostbyname( socket.gethostname() )
if ipaddress == '127.0.0.1':
    try:
        import local_settings # Assumed to be in the same directory.
        settings = local_settings
    except ImportError:
        import sys
        sys.stderr.write("Error: Can't find the file 'local_settings.py' in the directory containing %r. It appears you've customized things.\nYou'll have to run django-admin.py, passing it your settings module.\n(If the file local_settings.py does indeed exist, it's causing an ImportError somehow.)\n" % __file__)
        sys.exit(1)
else:
    try:
        import prod_settings # Assumed to be in the same directory.
        settings = prod_settings    
    except ImportError:
        import sys
        sys.stderr.write("Error: Can't find the file 'prod_settings.py' in the directory containing %r. It appears you've customized things.\nYou'll have to run django-admin.py, passing it your settings module.\n(If the file prod_settings.py does indeed exist, it's causing an ImportError somehow.)\n" % __file__)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    execute_manager(settings)
</code></pre>

<p>I found it to be easier to separate the settings file into two separate file instead of doing lots of ifs inside the settings file.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>For most of my projects I use following pattern:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create settings_base.py where I store settings that are common for all environments </li>
<li>Whenever I need to use new environment with specific requirements I create new settings file (eg. settings_local.py) which inherits contents of settings_base.py and overrides/adds proper settings variables (<code>from settings_base import *</code>)</li>
</ol>

<p>(To run manage.py with custom settings file you simply use --settings command option: <code>manage.py &lt;command&gt; --settings=settings_you_wish_to_use.py</code>)</p>
