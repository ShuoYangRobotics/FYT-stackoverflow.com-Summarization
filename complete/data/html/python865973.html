<h3>Question (ID-865973):</h3><h2>Algorithm: How to Delete every other file</h2><p>I have a folder with thousands of images.
I want to delete every other image.
What is the most effective way to do this?
Going through each one with i%2==0 is still O(n).
Is there a fast way to do this (preferably in Python)?</p>

<p>Thx</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>To delete half the N images you <strong>cannot</strong> be faster than O(N)!  You <em>do</em> know that the O() notation means (among other things) that constant multiplicative factors are irrelevant, yes?</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><pre><code>import os
l = os.listdir('/some/dir/with/files')

for n in l[::2]:
    os.unlink(n)
</code></pre>

<p>The only way to be faster than O(n) is if your files are already sorted, and you only want to delete 1 file.</p>

<p>You said i%2==0, this means you are deleting every "even" file. O(n/2) is still O(n)</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I fail to see any conceivable way in which deleting <code>n/2</code> files could be faster than O(n), unless the filesystem has some special feature for deleting large numbers of files (but I don't think that actually exists in practice, if it's even possible)</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>If you wanted to delete Log(n) files, there would be... You can store images in a database, though ( MySQL has a "blob" type, among several others, that will store your images). Then you could do it in O(1) if you named them smartly.</p>

<p>/edit
i hate how i have to use shorthand and bad grammar to get my answers in quickly!!!</p>

<p>if you're looking for a python equivalent of rm -rf *2.img *4.img *6.img *8.img *0.img, know that the computer still has to go through the entire list of files</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You could use <code>islice</code> from the <code>itertools</code> module. Here goes your example:</p>

<pre><code>import os, itertools
dirContent = os.listdir('/some/dir/with/files')
toBeDeleted = itertools.islice(dirContent, 0, len(dirContent), 2)
# Now remove the files
[os.unlink(file) for file in toBeDeleted]
</code></pre>

<p>This is another form of doing what you want, although I'm not sure if it'll be faster. Hope this helps.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>"Going through each one with i%2==0 is still O(n)"</p>

<p>Increment by 2 instead of incrementing by 1?</p>

<pre><code>for(i = 0; i &lt; numFiles; i += 2) {
  deleteFile(files[i]);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Seriously though: iterating through a list of files probably isn't the slowest part of your file deletion algo.  The actual deletion likely takes several orders of magnitude more time.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>I would try to use something operating-system specific like:</p>

<p>linux:</p>

<pre><code>@files = grep { -f "$dir/$_" &amp;&amp; /*.H$/ }
unlink @files
</code></pre>

<p>Win:</p>

<pre><code>$file_delete =~ /H$/;
rm $file_delete
</code></pre>

<p>to see if your os can do it faster than iterating in python.</p>

<p>use os.system(...) or subprocess.call(...)  to run these from python.</p>
