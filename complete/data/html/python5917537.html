<h3>Question (ID-5917537):</h3><h2>In Python, why won't something print without a newline?</h2><pre><code>import time
import sys
sys.stdout.write("1")
time.sleep(5)
print("2")
</code></pre>

<p>will print "12" after 5 seconds</p>

<pre><code>import time
import sys
sys.stdout.write("1\n")
time.sleep(5)
print("2")
</code></pre>

<p>will print "1\n" right away, then "2" after 5 seconds</p>

<p>Why is this?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>If you add "\n" then stream is flushed automaticaly, and it is not without new line at the end.
You can flush output with: <pre><code>sys.stdout.flush()</code></pre></p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Because <code>stdout</code> is buffered. You may be able to force the output sooner with a <code>sys.stdout.flush()</code> call.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>It's because output in Python is buffered by default - ordinarily you won't get the output until the buffer is full or something causes the buffer to be flushed. In this case the <code>\n</code> was sensed and caused an automatic flush.</p>

<p>See this question for ways around the problem: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/230751/how-to-flush-output-of-python-print">How to flush output of Python print?</a></p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p><em>Buffering</em>. It's not really Python, but rather your operating system/terminal. Output from any program is sent to a <em>buffer</em>, a holding area of memory. When a whole line is collected, it's sent to the screen. There is usually a hook, a method named something like <code>flush()</code>, to force output of partial lines.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>The sys.stdout.write command from the sys module purposefully prints out the statement without the \n character. This is how a normal call to the stdout stream works, such as in C++ or C, where the \n character must be added manually.</p>

<p>However the print command provided by Python automatically adds a \n character to the string, therefore simplifying the code and making it easier to read.</p>

<p>The reason the phenomenon in the first result happens is because the system is waiting for a flush to print out, which is provided by the \n character. You can avoid this by using this command, <code>sys.stdout.flush()</code>, which will flush the stdout stream which forces it to print.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Consider that when you type a command into a computer, it doesn't know <em>you're finished</em> until you press ENTER</p>

<p>Similarly, the newline tells Python you've finished that line.</p>
