<h3>Question (ID-55180):</h3><h2>In Python, how can you easily retrieve sorted items from a dictionary?</h2><p>Dictionaries unlike lists are not ordered (and do not have the 'sort' attribute). Therefore, you can not rely on getting the items in the same order when first added. </p>

<p>What is the easiest way to loop through a dictionary containing strings as the key value and retrieving them in ascending order by key?</p>

<p>For example, you had this:</p>

<pre><code>d = {'b' : 'this is b', 'a': 'this is a' , 'c' : 'this is c'}
</code></pre>

<p>I want to print the associated values in the following sequence sorted by key:</p>

<pre><code>this is a
this is b
this is c
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Do you mean that you need the values sorted by the value of the key?
In that case, this should do it:</p>

<pre><code>for key in sorted(d):
    print d[key]
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> changed to use sorted(d) instead of sorted(d.keys()), thanks <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/1694/eli-courtwright" rel="nofollow">Eli</a>!</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Or shorter,</p>

<pre><code>for key, value in sorted(d.items()):
    print value
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>This snippet will do so.  If you're going to do it frequently, you might want to make a 'sortkeys' method or somesuch to make it easier on the eyes.</p>

<pre><code>keys = list(d.keys())
keys.sort()
for key in keys:
    print d[key]
</code></pre>

<p>Edit:  dF's solution is better -- I forgot all about sorted().</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; d = {'b' : 'this is b', 'a': 'this is a' , 'c' : 'this is c'}
&gt;&gt;&gt; for k,v in sorted(d.items()):
...     print v, k
... 
this is a a
this is b b
this is c c
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><pre><code>for key in sorted(d):
  print d[key]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You can also sort a dictionary by value and control the sort order:</p>

<pre><code>import operator

d = {'b' : 'this is 3', 'a': 'this is 2' , 'c' : 'this is 1'}

for key, value in sorted(d.iteritems(), key=operator.itemgetter(1), reverse=True):
    print key, " ", value
</code></pre>

<p>Output:<br />
b   this is 3<br />
a   this is 2<br />
c   this is 1</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><pre><code>d = {'b' : 'this is b', 'a': 'this is a' , 'c' : 'this is c'}
ks = d.keys()
ks.sort()
for k in ks:
    print "this is " + k
</code></pre>
