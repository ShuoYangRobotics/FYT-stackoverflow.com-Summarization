<h3>Question (ID-1600591):</h3><h2>Using a Python Dictionary as a Key (Non-nested)</h2><p>Python doesn't allow dictionaries to be used as keys in other dictionaries. Is there a workaround for using non-nested dictionaries as keys? </p>

<p>The general problem with more complicated non-hashable objects and my specific use case has been <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1611797/using-non-hashable-python-objects-as-keys-in-dictionaries/1612220#1612220">moved here</a>. My original description of my use case was incorrect.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A tuple of pairs. You've already done that in your question. A <code>tuple</code> is required instead of <code>list</code> because the results rely on the ordering an immutability of the elements.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; tuple(sorted(a.items()))
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>A frozen set. It is a more suitable approach from the mathematical point of view, as it requires <strong>only the equality relation</strong> on the elements of your immutable <code>dict</code>, while the first approach requires the ordering relation besides equality.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; frozenset(a.items())
</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>If I needed to use dictionaries as keys, I would flatten the dictionary into a tuple of tuples.</p>

<p>You might find this SO question useful: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/635483/what-is-the-best-way-to-implement-nested-dictionaries-in-python">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/635483/what-is-the-best-way-to-implement-nested-dictionaries-in-python</a></p>

<p>And here is an example of a flatten module that will flatten dictionaries: <a href="http://yawpycrypto.sourceforge.net/html/public/Flatten.Flatten-module.html" rel="nofollow">http://yawpycrypto.sourceforge.net/html/public/Flatten.Flatten-module.html</a></p>

<p>I don't fully understand your use case and I suspect that you are trying to prematurely optimize something that doesn't need optimization. </p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>One way to do this would be to subclass the dict and provide a hash method.  ie:</p>

<pre><code>class HashableDict(dict):
    def __hash__(self):
        return hash(tuple(sorted(self.iteritems())))

&gt;&gt;&gt; d = HashableDict(a=1, b=2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; d2 = { d : "foo"}
&gt;&gt;&gt; d2[HashableDict(a=1, b=2)]
"foo"
</code></pre>

<p>However, bear in mind the reasons why dicts (or any mutable types) don't do this: mutating the object after it has been added to a hashtable will change the hash, which means the dict will now have it in the wrong bucket, and so incorrect results will be returned.</p>

<p>If you go this route, either be <strong>very</strong> sure that dicts will never change after they have been put in the other dictionary, or actively prevent them (eg. check that the hash never changes after the first call to <code>__hash__</code>, and throw an exception if not.)</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Hmm, isn't your use case just memoizing function calls? Using a decorator, you will have easy support for arbitrary functions. And yes, they often pickle the arguments, and using circular reasoning, this works for non-standard types as long as they can be pickled.</p>

<p>See e.g. <a href="http://www.finalcog.com/python-memoise-memoize-function-type" rel="nofollow">this memoization sample</a></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>To turn a someDictionary into a key, do this</p>

<pre><code>key = tuple(sorted(someDictionary .items())
</code></pre>

<p>You can easily reverse this with <code>dict( key )</code></p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I don't see why you'd ever want to do this, but if you really really do need to, you could try pickling the dictionary:</p>

<pre><code>mydict = {"a":1, "b":{"c":10}}
import pickle
key = pickle.dumps(mydict)

d[key] = value
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I don't know whether I understand your question correctly, but i'll give it a try</p>

<pre><code>    d[repr(a)]=value
</code></pre>

<p>You can interate over the dictionary like this</p>

<pre><code>for el1 in d:
        for el2 in eval(el1):
                print el2,eval(el1)[el2]
</code></pre>
