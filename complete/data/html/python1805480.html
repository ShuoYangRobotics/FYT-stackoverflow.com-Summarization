<h3>Question (ID-1805480):</h3><h2>How would you represent a MineSweeper grid in Python?</h2><p>What datastructure would you use in Python to represent the internal state of a MineSweeper grid?</p>

<p>Each x,y position will hold a numerical value which represents its current cell state (unexplored, mine, flag, ?).</p>

<p>Should I use nested lists?  This seems like the closest thing to a 2D array and it is what I would probably use in any other language (2d array that is).</p>

<p>I'm not that experienced with Python so could someone give me a suggestion?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>you could use a 2 dimensional array, holding objects for the state of each field:</p>

<pre><code>class FieldState(object):
  def __init__(self):
    self.unexplored = True
    self.mine = Random()
    self.flag = Random()
    ...

for x in range(12):
  for y in range(24):
    list[x][y] = FieldState()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Use a nested list. It's easy to set up:</p>

<pre><code>field = [([None] * height) for x in range(width)]

field[x][y] = "*"
</code></pre>

<p>The clearest thing would probably be a new class:</p>

<pre><code>class MineField(object):
    class _SingleField(object):
        mine = False
        flagged = False
        covered = True

    width = None
    height = None

    def __init__(self, width, height):
        super(MineField, self).__init__()
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
        self._field = [[self._SingleField() for y in range(height)]
                                            for x in range(width)]

        self.init_field(10)

    def init_field(self, minecount):
        pass

    def __getitem__(self, index):
        x, y = index
        return self._field[x][y]
</code></pre>

<p>To be used like this:</p>

<pre>
> m = MineField(10,10)
> m[4,9].mine
False
</pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Just to throw another option in the mix, you could use dicts indexed by tuples</p>

<pre><code>board = {}
board[1, 2] = 9
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>If you use an instance of <code>Board</code> class you can always change the internal representation later.</p>

<pre><code>class Board(object):
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.__width, self.__height = width, height
        self._board = [[FieldState() for y in xrange(height)]
                       for x in xrange(width)]
    @property
    def width(self):
        return self.__width

    def mark(self, x, y):
        self._board[x][y].mark()

    def __getitem__(self, coord):
        """
        &gt;&gt;&gt; board = Board(3, 4)
        &gt;&gt;&gt; field = board[1,2] # 2nd column, 3rd row
        """
        x, y = coord
        return self._board[x][y]

    ...
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>FieldState</code> is similar to the one from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1805480/how-would-you-represent-a-minesweeper-grid-in-python/1805509#1805509">@zlack's answer</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I think there are basically two layers of data: 1) map data: does square have a bomb (e.g represented by -1) or how many bombs are around it, 2) display data, what is shown on the square: bomb count, bomb, flag, question mark, empty, unopened.</p>

<p>So two nested lists (or one nested list of tuples) might be enough.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You could mark locations with a single int showing exactly what sits there, easing your coding considerably. You wouldnt need two data layers. </p>

<pre><code>00 nothing, noflag
10 bomb, noflag
01 nothing,flagged
11 bomb, flagged
</code></pre>

<p>Now since the first bit of that int shows whether there is a bomb or not, we can actually give it a few more bits and indicate neighbour count as well. </p>

<pre><code>000 no-neighbor
001 one neighbor
010 two...
</code></pre>

<p>and so on. Storing this only takes a single byte and even leaves room for expansion.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>A map of 'tile' or 'cell' objects, keyed to the coordinates as a pair. </p>

<pre><code>current = (1,1)
if grid[current].isFlagged():
   do_whatever;
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, map takes a little more space than array, and the tile class will have a tiny bit more footprint than a primitive bitmap or number, but I assume your board isn't 1024x1024 and you're not in a highly constrainted RAM situation.</p>

<p>If you do more than look up the tiles in the grid, then do consider JF's Board object to wrap the array.</p>

<p>Python is an OO language, and often the simplest and clearest thing that works is to use classes and objects wisely.</p>

<p>Note: you might also look at the named_tuple class for situations that seem too simple for a proper class.</p>
