<h3>Question (ID-1810109):</h3><h2>Parsing a string which represents a list of tuples</h2><p>I have strings which look like this one:</p>

<pre><code>"(8, 12.25), (13, 15), (16.75, 18.5)"
</code></pre>

<p>and I would like to convert each of them into a python data structure. Preferably a list (or tuple) of tuples containing a pair of float values.</p>

<p>I could do that with <code>eval("(8, 12.25), (13, 15), (16.75, 18.5)")</code> which gives me a tuple of tuples, but I don't think naively evaluating external information would be a wise decision.</p>

<p>So I wondered what an elegant pythonic solution might look like.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I've used <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28369/is-safeeval-really-safe">safe_eval</a> for jobs like this in the past.  </p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If you're working with a CSV file, and you want more than the "naive" solution which doesn't handle any errors, you're probably best off using the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow">Python's CSV module</a>.</p>

<p>I've worked with it before. You can get some pretty robust parsing behavior out of it, and I think it provides builtins that will handle your entire parsing needs with this sort of thing. Look up commaSeparatedList and nestedExpr.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><pre><code>def parse(s):
    tuples = s.split('), ')
    out = []
    for x in tuples:
        a,b = x.strip('()').split(', ')
        out.append((float(a),float(b)))
    return out
</code></pre>

<p>this should do the job.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>what's wrong with doing it systematically ? split on ")", then go through the list, remove all "(".</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s="(8, 12.25), (13, 15), (16.75, 18.5)"
&gt;&gt;&gt; [ i.replace("(","") for i in s.split(")") ]
['8, 12.25', ', 13, 15', ', 16.75, 18.5', '']
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = [ i.replace("(","") for i in s.split(")") ]
&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in b:
...  print i.strip(", ").replace(" ","").split(",")
...
['8', '12.25']
['13', '15']
['16.75', '18.5']
['']
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can bring each element into your data structure.</p>
