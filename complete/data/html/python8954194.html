<h3>Question (ID-8954194):</h3><h2>Looking for library/tool to visualise multi-dimensional data</h2><p>I'm using Python in an attempt to analyse a large chunk of empiric measurements.  In essence, I've two functions transforming the empiric data which also takes 3 'count' parameters - and returns a sequence of floats in each configuration.  I'm expecting (hoping) to see some interesting patterns emerge when appropriate parameters are selected.  I anticipate that the patterns might be relative between sequences returned for each function - and/or relate to patterns of some kind in the parameters.  In case it's relevant, the 3 'count' parameters roughly correspond to:</p>

<ul>
<li>A 'window size' on the underlying data over which summary statistics are calculated</li>
<li>A number of consecutive windows used to compute a single summary statistic (i.e. the trade-off between greater spatial or greater temporal accuracy)</li>
<li>An 'minimum age' - an offset into history of the underlying data.</li>
</ul>

<p>The summary statistics (which generate the resulting sequences of floats for each parameter configuration) are non-trivial but will be independently sensitive to all three parameters.</p>

<p>I'm interested in visualisation techniques - suited to RAD/ad-hoc enquiry that will help me experiment with this multi-dimensional data.</p>

<p>So far, I've tinkered with <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">MatPlotLib</a> but find being restricted generating two graphs of 2/3 dimensions in the style of batch processing makes investigation very tedious.  Ideally, I'd find a tool that would allow me to visualise more than two dimensions... perhaps allowing me to switch real-time between dimensions in an interactive GUI.</p>

<p>I'd really appreciate hints from any visualisation gurus as to suitable tools I should investigate - ideally to integrate with my existing Python functions - or in other languages.  I'd especially like to hear any anecdotes of success with similar visualisation problems.</p>

<p><em><strong>EDIT to add</em></strong>: One possible approach I'm considering is to use animation on 2 or 3D plots (to capture another dimension... leaving 1 or 2 for manual selection)... though I've found no good tools to help me achieve this, yet.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ggobi.org/">GGobi</a> is an open source visualization program for exploring high-dimensional data. It provides highly dynamic and interactive graphics such as tours, as well as familiar graphics such as the scatterplot, barchart and parallel coordinates plots. Plots are interactive and linked with brushing and identification.</p>

<p>There's a tutorial that covers both of the above systems <a href="http://lookingatdata.com/jsm-2009/">here</a>. </p>

<p><a href="http://rpy.sourceforge.net/">RPy</a> is a very simple, yet robust, Python interface to the R Programming Language. It can manage all kinds of R objects and can execute arbitrary R functions (including the graphic functions). All errors from the R language are converted to Python exceptions. Any module installed for the R system can be used from within Python. </p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You might want to look at outputting SVG with animation, in which case <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/634964/svg-diagrams-using-python">this question</a> might interest you. I suspect the animation aspects will require a lot of work on your part. Another option is maybe visualizing the data as a graph, although I'm don't know enough about your data to know whether this would be useful to you. If it is, cytoscape is <a href="http://wiki.cytoscape.org/ScriptingPlugins#Python_.28New.21.29" rel="nofollow">python scriptable</a></p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If all you want is an animated surface, then gnuplot can do it. A quick intro on it <a href="https://enteropia.wordpress.com/2011/04/19/animation-with-gnuplot-animating-pendulum/" rel="nofollow">can be found here</a>, or <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/faq/faq.html#SECTION00056000000000000000" rel="nofollow">from the gnuplot FAQ</a>. More detail can obviously be found in the gnuplot docs.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You could try <a href="http://packages.python.org/guiqwt/" rel="nofollow"><code>guiqwt</code></a>. It's aimed for 2D graphs, but targets more specifically interactive plots (as opposed to Matplotlib, although it can handle some degree of interaction too). From the <em>guiqwt</em> documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
  
  <p>Based on PyQwt (plotting widgets for PyQt4 graphical user interfaces)
  and on the scientific modules NumPy and SciPy, guiqwt is a Python
  library providing efficient 2D data-plotting features (curve/image
  visualization and related tools) for interactive computing and
  signal/image processing application development.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Performances</strong></p>
  
  <p>The most popular Python module for data plotting is currently
  matplotlib, an open-source library providing a lot of plot types and
  an API (the pylab interface) which is very close to MATLAB’s plotting
  interface.</p>
  
  <p>guiqwt plotting features are quite limited in terms of plot types
  compared to matplotlib. However the currently implemented plot types
  are much more efficient. For example, the guiqwt image showing
  function (guiqwt.pyplot.imshow()) do not make any copy of the
  displayed data, hence allowing to show images which are much larger
  than with its matplotlib‘s counterpart. In other terms, when showing a
  30-MB image (16-bits unsigned integers for example) with guiqwt, no
  additional memory is wasted to display the image (except for the
  offscreen image of course which depends on the window size) whereas
  matplotlib takes more than 600-MB of additional memory (the original
  array is duplicated four times using 64-bits float data types).</p>

<p>(I haven't tried it, so I can't comment on these claims.)</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Sounds like <a href="http://github.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/" rel="nofollow">Mayavi</a> might fit your needs. It is written in Python, can be used interactively and supports 3D graphs and animations. You can have a look at <a href="http://github.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/application.html#tutorial-examples-to-learn-mayavi" rel="nofollow">this tutorial</a> to see if it fits your needs.</p>

<p>I have done an interactive 3D visualization with animation in Python using the older version 1 of mayavi, see <a href="http://mayavi.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">this page</a>.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Edit</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, most Mayavi examples show off too much advanced functionality. Here are two examples that demonstrate more basic applications. If these two do not fit your needs, then Mayavi may not be a good choice in your case. My understanding is that you have arrays of floats that you want to visualize.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>

<p>Here is a specific example from the older page on what you can do with a 3D array of floats: <a href="http://mayavi.sourceforge.net/screenshots/heart.gif" rel="nofollow">3D data example</a>. This example shows the use of isocontour surfaces, one solid cut plane through the data and another cut plane with isocontour lines. You can interactively move the cut planes around or choose different visualization tools. (In my case I had added another dimension and an animation that presented the data as 3D-cube slices through the hypercube.)</p>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>

<p>Here is another example of what a more "conventional" plot with Mayavi could look like: <a href="http://www.sam.math.ethz.ch/~hheumann/Tutorial/html/mayavi2_tips.html" rel="nofollow">Fourier transform example</a>. This is quite similar to what the many other plotting libraries do.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Okay, now that I understand your data I can definitely suggest a method of visualisation. A coloured 3D surface density plot. Use a0, a1 and a2 as standard x,y,z axes, use a3 as the time axis, and plot different colours over a monochromatic range (or cold to hot). That way the only thing that needs an interactive slider is a3.</p>

<p>As far as tools to do this are concerned</p>

<ol>
<li>I don't know whether gnuplot can do colour density plots, if it can this is your best bet. Generate an set of gifs across domain of a3, use imagemagick to make a single animated gif out of them, then use an animated .gif editor that allows you to move back and forth between frames</li>
<li>Again, with matplotlib, I'm not certain whether it is possible to do colour density plots</li>
<li>SVG can definitely do everything you need to do, including the animation aspects, but as I've said before, is going to be a lot of hard work.</li>
</ol>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Go download a free trial of Tableau (<a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/" rel="nofollow">www.tableausofware.com</a>). It will encode your data on X, Y, size, color and shape, and you can create small multiples any other dimensions you have -- i.e. you can look at lots of dimensions at once. You can try lots and lots of visualizations very rapidly. There is free training on the company website.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I work for them.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>The simplest visualization for 3+dimensions is bubble chart or motion chart. On top of the x and y axis you can use the bubble size and the bubble color for the extra dimensions.</p>

<p>Google visualization (http://code.google.com/apis/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/motionchart.html) and its google spreadsheet interactive mode give a simple interface to play with which of the dimensions is on which of the axis/size/color.</p>

<p>It is not aimed at handling too many data points, but you can use it to identify patterns on samples of the data with ease.</p>
