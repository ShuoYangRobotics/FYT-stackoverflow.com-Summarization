<h3>Question (ID-260738):</h3><h2>Play audio with python</h2><p>How can i play audio (it would be like a 1sec sound) from a python script?</p>

<p>It would be best if it was platform independent, but first of it needs to work on a mac.</p>

<p>I know i could just execute the 'afplay file.mp3' command from within python, but is it possible to do it in raw python? I would also be better if it diddnt rely on external libraries.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Your best bet is probably to use <a href="http://www.pygame.org" rel="nofollow">pygame/SDL</a>. It's an external library, but it has great support across platforms.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You can find information about Python audio here: <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/Audio/" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.python.org/moin/Audio/</a></p>

<p>It doesn't look like it can play .mp3 files without external libraries. You could either convert your .mp3 file to a .wav or other format, or use a library like <a href="http://pymedia.org/" rel="nofollow">PyMedia</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Also most of the modern GUI toolkits (wx, QT ...) have some sort of multimedia support</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p><a href="http://pyglet.org/" rel="nofollow">Pyglet</a> has the ability to play back audio through an external library called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/avbin" rel="nofollow">AVbin</a>. Pyglet is a ctypes wrapper around native system calls on each platform it supports. Unfortunately, I don't think anything in the standard library will play audio back.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You can't do this without a nonstandard library.</p>

<p>for windows users who end up in this thread, try <a href="http://python.net/crew/mhammond/win32/" rel="nofollow">pythonwin</a>.  <a href="http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/mixer.html" rel="nofollow">PyGame</a> has some sound support.  For hardware accelerated game audio, you'll probably need to call OpenAL or similar through ctypes.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>If you need portable Python audio library try <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/" rel="nofollow">PyAudio</a>. It certainly has a mac port.</p>

<p>As for mp3 files: it's certainly doable in "raw" Python, only I'm afraid you'd have to code everything yourself :). If you can afford some external library I've found some <a href="http://n2.nabble.com/Lame-python-bindings-td33898.html" rel="nofollow">PyAudio - PyLame sample</a> here.</p>
