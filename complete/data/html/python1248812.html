<h3>Question (ID-1248812):</h3><h2>What does the "s!" operator in Perl do?</h2><p>I have this Perl snippet from a script that I am translating into Python. I have no idea what the "s!" operator is doing; some sort of regex substitution. Unfortunately searching Google or Stackoverflow for operators like that doesn't yield many helpful results.</p>

<pre><code> $var =~ s!&lt;foo&gt;.+?&lt;/foo&gt;!!;
 $var =~ s!;!/!g;
</code></pre>

<p>What is each line doing? I'd like to know in case I run into this operator again.</p>

<p>And, what would equivalent statements in Python be?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p><code>s!foo!bar!</code> is the same as the more common <code>s/foo/bar/</code>, except that foo and bar can contain unescaped slashes without causing problems. What it does is, it replaces the first occurence of the regex foo with bar. The version with g replaces all occurences.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>It's doing exactly the same as <code>$var =~ s///</code>. i.e. performing a search and replace within the <code>$var</code> variable.</p>

<p>In Perl you can define the delimiting character following the <code>s</code>. Why ? So, for example, if you're matching '/', you can specify another delimiting character ('!' in this case) and not have to escape or backtick the character you're matching. Otherwise you'd end up with (say)</p>

<pre><code>s/;/\//g;
</code></pre>

<p>which is a little more confusing.</p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Perl lets you choose the delimiter for many of its constructs.  This makes it easier to see what is going on in expressions like</p>

<pre><code>$str =~ s{/foo/bar/baz/}{/quux/};
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see though, not all delimiters have the same effects.  Bracketing characters (<code>&lt;&gt;</code>, <code>[]</code>, <code>{}</code>, and <code>()</code>) use different characters for the beginning and ending.  And <code>?</code>, when used as a delimiter to a regex, causes the regexes to match only once between calls to the <code>reset()</code> operator.</p>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>s is the substitution operator. Usually it is in the form of <code>s/foo/bar/</code>, but you can replace // separator characters some other characters like <em>!</em>. Using other separator charaters may make working with things like paths a lot easier since you don't need to escape path separators.</p>

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p><code>s</code> is the substitution operator. Normally this uses '/' for the delimiter:</p>

<pre><code>s/foo/bar/
</code></pre>

<p>, but this is not required: a number of other characters can be used as delimiters instead. In this case, '!' has been used as the delimiter, presumably to avoid the need to escape the '/' characters in the actual text to be substituted.</p>

<p>In your specific case, the first line removes text matching '.+?'; i.e. it removes 'foo' tags with or without content.</p>

<p>The second line replaces all ';' characters with '/' characters, globally (all occurences).</p>

<p>The python equivalent code uses the <code>re</code> module:</p>

<pre><code>f=re.sub(searchregx,replacement_str,line)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p><code>s!</code> is syntactic sugar for the 'proper' <code>s///</code> operator. Basically, you can substitute whatever delimiter you want instead of the '/'s.</p>

<p>As to what each line is doing, the first line is matching occurances of the regex <code>&lt;foo&gt;.+?&lt;/foo&gt;</code> and replacing the whole lot with nothing. The second is matching the regex <code>;</code> and replacing it with <code>/</code>.</p>

<p><code>s///</code> is the substitute operator. It takes a regular expression and a substitution string.</p>

<pre><code>s/regex/replace string/;
</code></pre>

<p>It supports most (all?) of the normal regular expression switches, which are used in the normal way (by appending them to the end of the operator).</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>And the python equivalent is to use the <code>re</code> module.</p>
