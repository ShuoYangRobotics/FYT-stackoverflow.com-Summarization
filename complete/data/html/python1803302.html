<h3>Question (ID-1803302):</h3><h2>Pythonic way to select first variable that evaluates to True</h2><p>I have some variables and I want to select the first one that evaluates to True, or else return a default value.</p>

<p>For instance I have <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>. My existing code:</p>

<pre><code>result = a if a else (b if b else (c if c else default))
</code></pre>

<p>Another approach I was considering:</p>

<pre><code>result = ([v for v in (a, b, c) if v] + [default])[0]
</code></pre>

<p>But they both feel messy, so is there a more Pythonic way?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>If one variable is not "defined", you can't access its name. So any reference to 'a' raises a NameError Exception.</p>

<p>In the other hand, if you have something like:</p>

<pre><code>a = None
b = None
c = 3
</code></pre>

<p>you can do</p>

<pre><code>default = 1
r = a or b or c or default
# r value is 3
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Did you mean returning first value for what <code>bool(value)==True</code>? Then you can just rely on the fact that <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/expressions.html#boolean-operations" rel="nofollow">boolean operators return last evaluated argument</a>:</p>

<pre><code>result = a or b or c or default
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You could do something like this (in contrast to the other answers this is a solution where you don't <strong>have</strong> to define the 'missing' values as being either <code>None</code> or <code>False</code>):</p>

<pre><code>b = 6
c = 8

def first_defined(items):
    for x in items:
        try:
            return globals()[x]
            break
        except KeyError:
            continue

print first_defined(["a", "b", "c"])
</code></pre>

<p>In order to avoid NameErrors when a, b or c isn't defined: give the function a list of strings instead of variable references (you can't pass non-existing references). If you are using variables outside the 'globals()' scope, you could use getattr with its default argument.</p>

<p>--  </p>

<p>If a, b and c are defined, I'd go for something like this (considering the fact that an empty string, None or False evaluate to a boolean <code>False</code>):</p>

<pre><code>a = None
b = 6
c = 8

def firstitem(items):
    for x in items:
        if x:
            return x
            break
        else:
            continue

print firstitem([a, b, c])
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Don't know if this works in every case, but this works for this case.</p>

<pre><code>a = False
b = "b"
c = False
default = "default"
print a or b or c or default # b
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>How about this ?  </p>

<pre><code>a=None  
b=None  
c=None  
val= reduce(lambda x,y:x or y,(a,b,c,"default"))  
print val
</code></pre>

<p>The above prints <code>"default"</code>. If any of the inputs is defined, <code>val</code> would contain the first defined input.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>So long as <code>default</code> evaluates to True:</p>

<pre><code>result = next((x for x in (a, b, c, d , e, default) if x))
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>If by <code>defined</code> you mean <code>ever assigned any value whatsoever to in any scope accessible from here</code>, then trying to access an "undefined" variable will raise a NameError exception (or some subclass thereof, but catching NameError will catch the subclass too).  So, the simplest way to perform, literally, the absolutely weird task you ask about, is:</p>

<pre><code>for varname in ('a', 'b', 'c'):
  try: return eval(varname)
  except NameError: pass
return default
</code></pre>

<p>Any alleged solution lacking a try/except won't work under the above meaning for "defined". Approaches based on exploring specific scopes will either miss other scopes, or be quite complex by trying to replicate the scope-ordering logic that <code>eval</code> does for you so simply.</p>

<p>If by "defined" you actually mean "assigned a value that evaluates to true (as opposed to false)", i.e., all values are actually <strong>defined</strong> (but might happen to be false, and you want the first true value instead), then the already-proposed <code>a or b or c or default</code> becomes the simplest approach. But that's a totally different (and even weirder!) meaning for the word "defined"!-)</p>
