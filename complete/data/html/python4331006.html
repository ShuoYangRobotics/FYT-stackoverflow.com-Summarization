<h3>Question (ID-4331006):</h3><h2>Persistent objects in recursive python functions</h2><p>I am trying to write a recursive function that needs to store and modify an object (say a set) as it recurses. Should I use a global name inside the function? Another option is  to modify or inherit the class of the parameter of the function so that it can keep this persistent object but I don't find it elegant. I could also use a stack if I would forgo the recursion altogether... </p>

<p>Is there a pythonic way of doing this? Could a generator do the trick? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Just pass through your persistent object through the recursive method.</p>

<pre><code>def recursivemethod(obj_to_act_on, persistent_obj=None):

if persistent_obj == None:
    persistent_obj = set()

# Act on your object

return recursivemethod(newobj, persistent_obj)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Objects are passed by reference.  If you're only modifying an object, you can do that from within a recursive function and the change will be globally visible.</p>

<p>If you need to assign a variable inside a recursive function and see it after the function returns, then you can't just assign a local variable with <code>=</code>.  What you can do is update a field of another object.</p>

<pre><code>class Accumulator: pass

def foo():
    # Create accumulator
    acc = Accumulator()
    acc.value = 0

    # Define and call a recursive function that modifies accumulator
    def bar(n):
        if (n &gt; 0): bar(n-1)
        acc.value = acc.value + 1
    bar(5)

    # Get accumulator
    return acc.value
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Pass the set into the recursive method as an argument, then modify it there before passing it to the next step. Complex objects are passed by reference.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>If the object you pass is mutable then changes to it in deeper recursions will be seen in earlier recursions.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><ol>
<li><p>Use a variable global to the function.</p></li>
<li><p>Pass the object around as an accumulator:</p>

<pre><code>def recurse(foo, acc=None):
    acc = {}
    recurse(acc)
</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>If it's a container (not an immutable data type), you can pass the object through:</p>

<pre><code>import random

def foo(bar=None, i=10):
    if bar is None:
        bar = set()
    if i == 0:
        return bar
    bar |= set(random.randint(1, 1000) for i in xrange(10))
    return foo(bar, i - 1)

random_numbers_set = foo()
</code></pre>

<p>(Don't ask me what that's meant to do... I was just typing random things :P)</p>
