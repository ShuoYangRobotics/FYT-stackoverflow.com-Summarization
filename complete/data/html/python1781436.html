<h3>Question (ID-1781436):</h3><h2>Redirecting CGI error output from STDERR to a file (python AND perl)</h2><p>I'm moving a website to Hostmonster and asked where the server log is located so I can automatically scan it for CGI errors. I was told, "We're sorry, but we do not have cgi errors go to any files that you have access to."</p>

<p>For organizational reasons I'm stuck with Hostmonster and this awful policy, so as a workaround I thought maybe I'd modify the CGI scripts to redirect STDERR to a custom log file.</p>

<p>I have a lot of scripts (269) so I need an easy way in both Python and Perl to redirect STDERR to a custom log file.</p>

<p>Something that accounts for file locking either explicitly or implicitly would be great, since a shared CGI error log file could theoretically be written to by more than one script at once if more than one script fails at the same time.</p>

<p>(I want to use a shared error log so I can email its contents to myself nightly and then archive or delete it.)</p>

<p>I know I may have to modify each file (grrr), that's why I'm looking for something elegant that will only be a few lines of code. Thanks.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>For Perl, just close and re-open <code>STDERR</code> to point to a file of your choice.</p>

<pre><code>close STDERR;
open STDERR, '&gt;&gt;', '/path/to/your/log.txt' 
  or die "Couldn't redirect STDERR: $!";

warn "this will go to log.txt";
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, you could look into a filehandle multiplexer like <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~salva/File-Tee/lib/File/Tee.pm" rel="nofollow">File::Tee</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Python: <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/cgitb.html" rel="nofollow">cgitb</a>. At the top of your script, before other imports:</p>

<pre><code>import cgitb
cgitb.enable(False, '/home/me/www/myapp/logs/errors')
</code></pre>

<p>(‘errors’ being a directory the web server user has write-access to.)</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>In Perl try <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/CGI/Carp.html" rel="nofollow">CGI::Carp</a></p>

<pre><code>BEGIN { 
use CGI::Carp qw(carpout); 
use diagnostics;
open(LOG, "&gt;errors.txt"); 
carpout(LOG);
close(LOG);
}

use CGI::Carp qw(fatalsToBrowser);
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>python:</p>

<p>import sys</p>

<p>sys.stderr = open('file_path_with_write_permission/filename', 'w')</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>The solution I finally went with was similar to the following, near the top of all my scripts:</p>

<p>Perl:</p>

<pre><code>open(STDERR,"&gt;&gt;","/path/to/my/cgi-error.log")
    or die "Could not redirect STDERR: $OS_ERROR";
</code></pre>

<p>Python:</p>

<pre><code>sys.stderr = open("/path/to/my/cgi-error.log", "a")
</code></pre>

<p>Apparently in Perl you don't need to close the STDERR handle before reopening it.</p>

<p>Normally I would close it anyway as a best practice, but as I said in the question, I have 269 scripts and I'm trying to minimize the changes. (Plus it seems more Perlish to just re-open the open filehandle, as awful as that sounds.)</p>

<p>In case anyone else has something similar in the future, here's what I'm going to do for updating all my scripts at once:</p>

<p>Perl:</p>

<pre><code>find . -type f -name "*.pl" -exec perl -pi.bak -e 's%/usr/bin/perl%/usr/bin/perl\nopen(STDERR,"&gt;&gt;","/path/to/my/cgi-error.log")\n    or die "Could not redirect STDERR: \$OS_ERROR";%' {} \;
</code></pre>

<p>Python:</p>

<pre><code>find . -type f -name "*.py" -exec perl -pi.bak -e 's%^(import os, sys.*)%$1\nsys.stderr = open("/path/to/my/cgi-error.log", "a")%' {} \;
</code></pre>

<p>The reason I'm posting these commands is that it took me quite a lot of syntactical massaging to get those commands to work (e.g., changing Couldn't to Could not, changing #!/usr/bin/perl to just /usr/bin/perl so the shell wouldn't interpret ! as a history character, using $OS_ERROR instead of $!, etc.)</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who commented.  Since no one answered for both Perl and Python I couldn't really "accept" any of the given answers, but I did give votes to the ones which led me in the right direction.  Thanks again!</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Python has the sys.<strong>stderr</strong> module that you might want to look into.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;help(sys.__stderr__.read)
Help on built-in function read:

read(...)
    read([size]) -&gt; read at most size bytes, returned as a string.

    If the size argument is negative or omitted, read until EOF is reached.
    Notice that when in non-blocking mode, less data than what was requested
    may be returned, even if no size parameter was given.
</code></pre>

<p>You can store the output of this in a string and write that string to a file.</p>

<p>Hope this helps</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>In my Perl CGI programs, I usually have</p>

<pre><code>BEGIN {
  open(STDERR,'&gt;&gt;','stderr.log');
}
</code></pre>

<p>right after shebang line and "use strict;use warnings;". If you want, you may append $0 to file name. But this will not solve multiple programs problem, as several copies of one programs may be run simultaneously. I usually just have several output files, for every program group.</p>
