<h3>Question (ID-1538342):</h3><h2>How can I get the name of an object in Python?</h2><p>Is there any way to get the name of an object in Python?  For instance:</p>

<pre><code>my_list = [x, y, z] # x, y, z have been previously defined

for bla in my_list:
    print "handling object ", name(bla) # &lt;--- what would go instead of `name`?
    # do something to bla
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Some context:</p>

<p>What I'm actually doing is creating a list of functions that I can specify by the command line.</p>

<p>I have:</p>

<pre><code>def fun1:
    pass
def fun2
    pass
def fun3:
    pass

fun_dict = {'fun1': fun1,
            'fun2': fun2,
            'fun3': fun3}
</code></pre>

<p>I get the name of the function from the commandline and I want to call the relevant function:</p>

<pre><code>func_name = parse_commandline()

fun_dict[func_name]()
</code></pre>

<p>And the reason I want to have the name of the function is because I want to create <code>fun_dict</code> without writing the names of the functions twice, since that seems like a good way to create bugs.  What I want to do is:</p>

<pre><code>fun_list = [fun1, fun2, fun3] # and I'll add more as the need arises

fun_dict = {}
[fun_dict[name(t) = t for t in fun_list] # &lt;-- this is where I need the name function
</code></pre>

<p>This way I only need to write the function names once.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Objects do not necessarily have names in python, so you can't get the name.
It's not unusual for objects to have a <code>__name__</code> attribute in those cases that they do have a name, but this is not a part of standard python, and most built in types do not have one.</p>

<p>When you create a variable, like the x, y, z above then those names just act as "pointers" or "references" to the objects. The objects itself do not know what names you are using for it, and you can not easily (if at all) get the names of all references to an object.</p>

<p>Update: However, functions do have a <code>__name__</code> (unless they are lambdas) so, in this case you can do:</p>

<pre><code>dict([(t.__name__, t) for t in fun_list])
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>That's not really possible, as there could be multiple variables that have the same value, or a value might have no variable, or a value might have the same value as a variable only by chance.</p>

<p>If you really want to do that, you can use</p>

<pre><code>def variable_for_value(value):
    for n,v in globals().keys():
        if v == value:
            return n
    return None
</code></pre>

<p>However, it would be better if you would iterate over names in the first place:</p>

<pre><code>my_list = ["x", "y", "z"] # x, y, z have been previously defined

for name in my_list:
    print "handling variable ", name
    bla = globals()[name]
    # do something to bla
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Note that while, as noted, objects in general do not and cannot know what variables are bound to them, functions defined with <code>def</code> do have names in the <code>__name__</code> attribute (the name used in <code>def</code>).  Also if the functions are defined in the same module (as in your example) then <code>globals()</code> will contain a superset of the dictionary you want. </p>

<pre><code>def fun1:
  pass
def fun2:
  pass
def fun3:
  pass

fun_dict = {}
for f in [fun1, fun2, fun3]:
  fun_dict[f.__name__] = f
</code></pre>

<p>For this purpose you have a wonderful <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#getattr" rel="nofollow"><code>getattr</code></a> function, that allows you to get an object by known name. So you could do for example:</p>

<p><code>funcs.py:</code></p>

<pre><code>def func1(): pass
def func2(): pass
</code></pre>

<p><code>main.py:</code></p>

<pre><code>import funcs
option = command_line_option()
getattr(funcs, option)()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Variable names can be found in the globals() and locals() dicts. But they won't give you what you're looking for above. "bla" will contain the value of each item of my_list, not the variable.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Generally when you are wanting to do something like this, you create a class to hold all of these functions and name them with some clear prefix <code>cmd_</code> or the like.  You then take the string from the command, and try to get that attribute from the class with the <code>cmd_</code> prefixed to it.  Now you only need to add a new function/method to the class, and it's available to your callers.  And you can use the doc strings for automatically creating the help text.</p>

<p>As described in other answers, you may be able to do the same approach with <code>globals()</code> and regular functions in your module to more closely match what you asked for.</p>

<p>Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Tasks:
    def cmd_doit(self):
        # do it here

func_name = parse_commandline()
try:
    func = getattr('cmd_' + func_name, Tasks())
except AttributeError:
    # bad command: exit or whatever
func()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Here's another way to think about it.  Suppose there were a <code>name()</code> function that returned the name of its argument.  Given the following code:</p>

<pre><code>def f(a):
    return a

b = "x"
c = b
d = f(c)

e = [f(b), f(c), f(d)]
</code></pre>

<p>What should <code>name(e[2])</code> return, and why?</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Use a reverse dict.</p>

<pre><code>fun_dict = {'fun1': fun1,
            'fun2': fun2,
            'fun3': fun3}

r_dict = dict(zip(fun_dict.values(), fun_dict.keys()))
</code></pre>

<p>The reverse dict will map each function reference to the exact name you gave it in fun_dict, which may or may not be the name you used when you defined the function.  And, this technique generalizes to other objects, including integers.</p>

<p>For extra fun and insanity, you can store the forward and reverse values in the same dict.  I wouldn't do that if you were mapping strings to strings, but if you are doing something like function references and strings, it's not too crazy.</p>
