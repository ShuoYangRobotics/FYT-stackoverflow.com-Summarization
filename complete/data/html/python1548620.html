<h3>Question (ID-1548620):</h3><h2>Python for C++ or Java Programmer</h2><p>I have a background in C++ and Java and Objective C programming, but i am finding it hard to learn python, basically where its "Main Function" or from where the program start executing. So is there any tutorial/book which can teach python to people who have background in C++ or Java. Basically something which can show if how you were doing this in C++ and how this is done in Python.</p>

<p>OK i think i did not put the question heading or question right, basically i was confused about the "Main" Function, otherwise other things are quite obvious from python official documentation except this concept.</p>

<p>Thanks to all</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>When you run a script through the Python interpreter (or import that script from another script), <strong>it actually executes all the code from beginning to end</strong> -- in <em>that</em> sense, <strong>there is no "entry point" to a Python script</strong>.</p>

<p>So to work around this, Python automatically creates a <code>__name__</code> variable and fills it with the value <code>"__main__"</code> when you are running a script by itself (as opposed to something else importing that script).  That's why you'll see many scripts like:</p>

<pre><code>def foo():
    print "Hello!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
   foo()
</code></pre>

<p>where all the function/class definitions are at the top, and there is a similar if-statement as the last thing in the script.  You are guaranteed that Python will start executing the script from top-to-bottom, so it will read all of your definitions there.  If you wanted, you could intermingle actual functional code inside all the function definitions.</p>

<p>If this script was named <code>bar.py</code>, you could do <code>python bar.py</code> at the command line and you would see the script print out <code>"Hello!"</code>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you did <code>import bar</code> from another Python script, nothing would print out until you did <code>bar.foo()</code>, because <code>__name__</code> was no longer <code>"__main__"</code> and the if-statement failed, thus <code>foo</code> was never executed.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Excellent answer, but none points out what I think is one key insight for programmers coming to Python with background in other languages such as Java or C++: <code>import</code>, <code>def</code> and <code>class</code> are not "instructions to the compiler", "declarations", or other kind of magical incantations: they're executable statements like any other.  For example, the <code>def</code> statement:</p>

<pre><code>def f(x): return x + 23
</code></pre>

<p>is almost exactly equivalent to the assignment statement:</p>

<pre><code>f = lambda x: x + 23
</code></pre>

<p>(stylistically the <code>def</code> is preferable as it makes <code>f.__name__</code> meaningful -- that's the "almost" part; <code>lambda</code> is rather limited and should only ever be used when you're really keen to make an <em>anonymous</em> function rather than a normal named one).  Similarly,</p>

<pre><code>class X(object): zap = 23
</code></pre>

<p>is equivalent to the assignment:</p>

<pre><code>X = type('X', (), {'zap': 23})
</code></pre>

<p>(again, stylistically, <code>class</code> is preferable, afford more generality, like <code>def</code> it allows decoration, etc, etc; the point I'm making is that there is <em>semantic</em> equivalence here).</p>

<p>So, when you run a <code>.py</code> file, or import it for the first time in a program's run, Python executes its top-level statements one after the other -- in normal good Python style, most will be assignments, <code>def</code>, <code>class</code>, or <code>import</code>, but at least one will be a call (normally to a function) to execute that function's <em>body</em> of code (<code>def</code>, like <code>lambda</code>, just <em>compiles</em> that code; the compiled code object only executes when the function or lambda is <em>called</em>).  Other answers have already suggested practical considerations such as testing <code>__name__</code> in order to make a module that can either be run directly or imported, etc.</p>

<p>Finally, it's best to have all "significant" code in functions (or methods in classes), not just stylistically, but because code in a function executes significantly faster (since the Python compiler can then automatically optimize all accesses to local variables).  For example, consider...:</p>

<pre><code>import time

lotsotimes = range(1000*1000)

start = time.time()
for x in lotsotimes:
  x = x + x
stend = time.time()

print 'in module toplev: %.6f' % (stend - start)

def fun():
  start = time.time()
  for x in lotsotimes:
    x = x + x
  stend = time.time()

  print 'in function body: %.6f' % (stend - start)

fun()
</code></pre>

<p>On my laptop, with Python 2.6, this emits:</p>

<pre><code>in module toplev: 0.405440
in function body: 0.123296
</code></pre>

<p>So, for code that does a lot of variable accesses and little else, running it in a function as opposed to running it as module top-level code could speed it up by more than 3 times.</p>

<p>The detailed explanation: at module-level, all variables are inevitably kept in a dictionary, so each variable access is a dict-access; local variables of a function get optimized into a special array, so access is faster (the difference is even more extreme than the 20% or so speed-up you'd see by accessing an item in a Python list vs one in a Python dict, since the local-variable optimization also saves hashing &amp; other ancillary costs).</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><a href="http://diveintopython.org/" rel="nofollow">Dive into Python</a> is a good start. I wouldn't recommend to someone with no programming experience, but if you have coded in another language before, it will help you learn python idioms quickly.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>If you are quite familiar with several languages like C++ and Java, you may find it easy to follow the official <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/" rel="nofollow">Python Tutorial</a>. It is written in a classical language description bottom-up style from the lexical structure and syntax to more advanced concepts.</p>

<p>The already mentioned <a href="http://diveintopython.org/" rel="nofollow">Dive Into Python</a> takes a top-down approach in learning languages starting from a complete program that is obscure for a beginner and diving into its details.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I started Python over a year ago too, also C++ background.  </p>

<p>I've learned that everything is simpler in Python, you don't need to worry so much if you're doing it right, you probably are. Most of the things came natural.</p>

<p>I can't say I've read a book or anything, I usually pested the guys in #python on freenode a lot and looked at lots of other great code out there.</p>

<p>Good luck :)</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I second <a href="http://diveintopython.org/" rel="nofollow">Dive in to Python</a> as a resource. As for the main function, there isn't one. The "main" function is what you write in the script you run. </p>

<p>So a helloworld.py looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>print "Hello World"
</code></pre>

<p>and you run it with</p>

<pre><code>python helloworld.py
</code></pre>

<p>That's it!</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>The pithiest comment I guess is that the entry point is the 1st line of your script that is not a function or a class. You don't necessarily need to use the if hack unless you want to and your script is meant to be imported.</p>
