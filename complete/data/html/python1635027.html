<h3>Question (ID-1635027):</h3><h2>What's the simplest cross-platform way to pop up graphical dialogs in Python?</h2><p>I want the simplest possible way to pop up simple dialogs in Python scripts.  Ideally, the solution would:</p>

<ul>
<li>Work on Windows, OS X, Gnome, KDE</li>
<li>Look like a native dialog on any OS</li>
<li>Require minimal code</li>
</ul>

<p>To pop up a simple standard dialog should require only minimal code.  Essentially you're just saying "Pop up a standard dialog with this text", or "Pop up a dialog with question x and feed response into variable y".</p>

<p>I don't want to know about GUI frameworks or have to set up code that says "start a GUI thread, register an event handler, configure some window properties, run a loop", etc.  I don't want to have to set up a window or close the window afterward.  I give it the text to put in the window, it tells me what the user clicked on.  Everything else should be taken care of automatically.</p>

<p>I've listed Zenity and EasyGUI as example answers, since they're similar to what I want, but not perfect.</p>

<pre><code># File: hello1.py

from Tkinter import *

<p>If you want something more native looking, you'll have to install something like wxpython</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><a href="http://easygui.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">EasyGUI</a> is a single file, and provides a simple way to work with Tkinter dialogs, but they're still ugly non-native Tkinter dialogs.</p>

<pre><code>from easygui import msgbox

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenity" rel="nofollow">Zenity</a> works under Linux and <a href="http://www.placella.com/software/zenity/" rel="nofollow">Windows</a>, and can be called from Python directly:</p>

<pre><code>import os
os.system('zenity --info --text="Stuff"')
</code></pre>

<p>The return values from question boxes need to be captured for acting on, though, which is more complex, and you have to learn about communicating with subprocesses, etc.</p>

<p>It can also be used with the <a href="http://www.brianramos.com/docs/PyZenity/" rel="nofollow">PyZenity</a> front-end, which makes capturing return values simple:</p>

<pre><code>from PyZenity import InfoMessage
InfoMessage('Stuff')
</code></pre>

<p>I have tested PyZenity in both Ubuntu and Windows XP, and it works in both.</p>

<p>I read that Zenity is GTK+ only, but I tried it in Gnome and KDE and it looks native in both.  The port to Windows does not look native, though, because it uses the wrong GTK theme?</p>

<p>There are also other programs like <a href="http://techbase.kde.org/Development/Tutorials/Shell%5FScripting%5Fwith%5FKDE%5FDialogs" rel="nofollow">KDialog</a> and <a href="http://xdialog.free.fr/" rel="nofollow">Xdialog</a> that might be interfaced to a similar Python frontend that could check and see what executables are available so that it automatically takes care of everything?  (There's a <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/kdialog/" rel="nofollow">Ruby frontend for KDialog</a>, too.)</p>

<p>I don't know if PyZenity works under OS X, either.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>To extend on endolith's tkMessageBox answer with the ugly empty window in the background...</p>

<p>The code below pops up the box without the background window.</p>

<pre><code>import Tkinter, tkMessageBox
root = Tkinter.Tk()
root.withdraw()
tkMessageBox.showinfo("my dialog title", "my dialog message")
</code></pre>

<p>This is lifted directly from a useful comment I found at the bottom of <a href="http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/tkinter-standard-dialogs.htm" rel="nofollow">this article</a>.  Thanks to Jason (the commenter) and effbot.org.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>@ endolith, re: zenity for Windows.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I repackaged "Zenity  for Windows" and included the correct GTK-theme file. It looks much better now. :)
It is now available for download: <a href="http://www.placella.com/software/zenity/" rel="nofollow">http://www.placella.com/software/zenity/</a></p>

<p>Peace, Rouslan</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Another possibility is the <a href="http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/stdlib/tkMessageBox-module.html" rel="nofollow">tkMessageBox module</a>, which is apparently built into the standard library and is cross-platform, though this is even more ugly than the rest:</p>

<pre><code>import tkMessageBox
tkMessageBox.showinfo('Title','Stuff')
</code></pre>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2611/4059786460%5F65a942e828%5Fo.png" alt="Tkinter is super ugly" /></p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>wxPython is the best Python GUI library (IMO) and uses native widgets.</p>

<pre><code>import wx
app = wx.PySimpleApp()
dialog = wx.MessageDialog(None, 'wxPython is awesome!', 'Dialog Box', wx.OK|wx.ICON_INFORMATION)
dialog.ShowModal()
dialog.Destroy()
app.MainLoop()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>pyglet is another alternative, though it may not be the simplest. that being said, it's cross-platform and only depends on python, so there's no external dependencies. that fact alone can be reason enough to use it over others.</p>

<p>and all it can handle multimedia pretty easily as well, pretty handy if you want to display an image or video or something. </p>

<p>the example below is from the documentation...</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python
import pyglet
window = pyglet.window.Window()
label = pyglet.text.Label('Hello, world',
                      font_name='Times New Roman',
                      font_size=36,
                      x=window.width/2, y=window.height/2,
                      anchor_x='center', anchor_y='center')

@window.event
def on_draw():
    window.clear()
    label.draw()

pyglet.app.run()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>This is not possible. If you want simple then you have to use Tkinter because that is what is included. If Tkinter is not good enough then you will have to choose and package a GUI for each platform separately.</p>

<p>I suggest that you do use Tkinter and wrap the parts that you need in a class that will be even simpler to use.</p>
