<h3>Question (ID-3524611):</h3><h2>Substring Comparison in python</h2><p>If i have List PhoneDirectory
Eg:</p>

<pre><code>['John:009878788677' , 'Jefrey:67654654645' , 'Maria:8787677766']
</code></pre>

<p>Which is the function that can be use to compare the Presence of Substring (Eg: Joh) in each entry in the List .</p>

<p>I have tried using </p>

<pre><code>if(PhoneDirectory.find(Joh) != -1)
</code></pre>

<p>but it doesnt work</p>

<p>kindly Help..</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>If you want to check each entry separately:</p>

<pre><code>for entry in PhoneDirectory:
    if 'John' in entry: ...
</code></pre>

<p>If you just want to know if <em>any</em> entry satisfies the condition and don't care which one:</p>

<pre><code>if any('John' in entry for entry in PhoneDirectory):
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>Note that <code>any</code> will do no "wasted" work -- it will return <code>True</code> as soon as it finds any <em>one</em> entry meeting the condition (if no entries meet the condition, it does have to check every single one of them to confirm that, of course, and then returns <code>False</code>).</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Since no one has recommended this yet, I would do:</p>

<pre><code>all_johns = [p for p in PhoneDirectory if 'Joh' in p]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You can do a split on ":" and look for occurrences of what you are looking for in the first element of the resulting array.</p>

<pre><code>dir = ['John:009878788677' , 'Jefrey:67654654645' , 'Maria:8787677766'];
for a in dir:
    values = a.split(":")
    if values[0] == "John":
        print("John's number is %s" % (values[1]))
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You can use a list comprehension, like <code>[p for p in PhoneDirectory if p.find('Joh') != -1]</code>. This will give you a list of all matching items.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>If performance counts for this task use some <a href="http://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dyoo/python/suffix_trees/" rel="nofollow">SuffixTree</a> implementation. Or just make any DBMS engine do the indexing job.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><pre><code>if any(entry.startswith('John:') in entry for entry in PhoneDirectory)
</code></pre>

<p>But I would prepare something with two elements as you list of strings is not well suited to task:</p>

<pre><code>PhoneList = ['John:009878788677' , 'Jefrey:67654654645' , 'Maria:8787677766']

numbers = { a:b 
            for item in PhoneList
            for a,_,b in (item.partition(':'),)
            }

print numbers
print "%s's number is %s." % ( 'John', numbers['John'] )
</code></pre>
