<h3>Question (ID-4890172):</h3><h2>Can't understand the reason for an output in Python</h2><p>I've just started learning Python. I came across following code</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>if 0:</code></p>

<pre><code>  print "And now for something completely different..."
</code></pre>
  
  <p><code>else:</code></p>

<pre><code>  print "What's all this, then?"
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand that output should be <code>What's all this, then?</code> but I can't seem to find a proper explanation for that. Hope someone can make me understand that.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p><code>0</code> is <code>False</code> in a boolean context. Same applies for empty string, lists, etc.</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/expressions.html#booleans" rel="nofollow">python docs</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the context of Boolean operations, and also when expressions are used by control flow statements, the following values are interpreted as false: False, None, numeric zero of all types, and empty strings and containers (including strings, tuples, lists, dictionaries, sets and frozensets). All other values are interpreted as true. (See the <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html#object.__nonzero__" rel="nofollow">__nonzero__()</a> special method for a way to change this.)</p>
</blockquote>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Zero is interpreted as "false" in python (and many other programming languages)</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Numeric zero is always interpreted as false in Python:</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/expressions.html#booleans" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/reference/expressions.html#booleans</a></p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>And almost anything that isn't 0 is True when used in a test. Any number (including negatives) is treated as True, but 'None' is False. Non-empty character strings are True, empty ones are False.</p>

<p>Check out boolean or logical functions of Python in the docs. Also, forget everything you ever learnt in basic math(s) at school, because....</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 1 and 1
1

&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 and 2
2
</code></pre>

<p>Honestly, that makes sense...</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>As stated elsewhere, unlike some languages (but like some others), Python will interpret 0 as false, thus the else is activated instead of the then.  To make the then section run, you'd have to do something like <code>if 1:</code> (or another non-zero value) instead.  Please don't code like this in real life.  For more, please see the Python docs on <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/controlflow.html#if-statements" rel="nofollow">if</a> (and <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/compound_stmts.html#if" rel="nofollow">another</a>) and <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/expressions.html#booleans" rel="nofollow">booleans</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>0 is False. Both boolean and logically and in just about every other case.</p>

<p>What are you confused about?</p>
