<h3>Question (ID-2150144):</h3><h2>Is python a serious option for concurrent programming</h2><p>just considering starting to learning python but I have one concern before I invest more time. Let me phrase this as a statement followed by a concern for others to comment on as perhaps the assumptions in the statement are invalid:</p>

<p>I have read about GIL and the consensus seems to be if you require concurrent solutions in python your best bet is to fork a new process to avoid GIL.</p>

<p>My concern is that if I have a problem I'd like to split into N*2 pieces across N processors (assume for example I have a single server running a *nix o/s with say 8 cores) I will incur context switching penalties between processes rather than between threads, which is more costly, which will limit performance.</p>

<p>I ask this because other languages are out there that claim to excel in such a scenario and I wonder is python appropriate for this arena.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p><a href="http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html" rel="nofollow"><code>multiprocessing</code></a> can get around the GIL, but it introduces its own issues such as communication between the processes.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Python is not very good for CPU-bound concurrent programming. The GIL will (in many cases) make your program run as if it was running on a single core - or even worse. Even Unladen Swallow will (probably) not solve that problem (quote from their <a href="http://code.google.com/p/unladen-swallow/wiki/ProjectPlan" rel="nofollow">project plan</a>: "we are no longer as optimistic about our chances of removing the GIL completely").</p>

<p>As you already stated, other languages claim to be better in concurrent programming. <a href="http://www.haskell.org/" rel="nofollow">Haskell</a>, for example, has built-in functionality for programming concurrent applications. You could also try C++ with OpenMP, which I think makes parallelization very simple.</p>

<p>If your application is I/O-bound, Python may be a serious solution as the GIL is normally released while doing blocking calls.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>In my limited experience, the "context switch cost" is overrated as a performance limitation.</p>

<p>I/O bandwidth and memory are the most common limiting factors.  Python's I/O is comparable to many other languages, since it simply uses the standard C libraries pretty directly.</p>

<p>Your actual problem may not be typical.  However, many problems work out really well in multi-processing mode because they're actually I/O bound.  Often it's filesystem, web page reading or Database operations that limit performance long before context switches.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>If you're considering learning Python for addressing this problem, I might suggest taking a look at Erlang instead.  It has excellent support for very lightweight processes, and built-in primitives for IPC.</p>

<p>Not to discourage you from learning Python, of course, just suggesting there might be a better tool for this particular task.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Also if you are looking at object sharing between the python processes, i suggest you look at the answer by Alex in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1268252/python-possible-to-share-in-memory-data-between-2-separate-processes/1269055#1269055">this question</a></p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>writing codes for multiple process is not an easy task. </p>

<p>But if you start thinking to this way first, eventually, it is easier to scale if one machine isn't enough...Threads can't be used across machines...</p>
