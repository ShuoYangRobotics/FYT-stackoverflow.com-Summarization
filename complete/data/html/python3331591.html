<h3>Question (ID-3331591):</h3><h2>Python for-loop counter error</h2><p>I am attempting to script a short code to figure out the number of days it takes to reach a given principal in the bank due to daily interest. Using my code below does not yield any errors when run in IDLE, but the counter returns 0. Any ideas what I missed?</p>

<pre><code>def main():
    # irrelevant code elided by msw, Bal, Int and Tar are numeric
    counter = 0
    for i in range(0):
        if (Bal * Int) == Tar:
            print '1'
        else:
            counter + 1
    print counter
</code></pre>

<pre><code>for i in range(0):
    if (Bal * Int) == Tar:
        print '1'
    else:
        counter + 1
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li><code>range(0)</code> is an empty list, so the loop won't execute at all.</li>
<li><code>counter + 1</code> simply calculates one more than counter, it won't increment counter, you probably mean <code>counter += 1</code></li>
<li>There's nothing in the loop that changes at each iteration, so if you ever get into it, it will be an infinite loop.</li>
</ol>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I believe the formula to calculate final balance with interest is:</p>

<pre><code>Final = Principal * ( 1 + interest ) ** interest_period
</code></pre>

<p>Assuming I got this correct, then you can find out how many interest periods it will take by:</p>

<pre><code>def how_long(start_money, interest_rate, final_money):
    day = 0
    money = start_money
    while True:
        if money &gt;= final_money:
            break
        day += 1
        money = start_money * (1 + interest_rate)**day

    return day, money

   ...:     for i in range(0):

In [6]: x = test()

In [7]: print x

None

<p>See the return value is 'None'.
I don't know what are you trying to do. But The basic mistake is the Argument of range(x) function. The range(0) always return empty list. </p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>That's because you put range(0) which is an empty loop. Perhaps you could consider a while loop?</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Your loop <code>for i in range(0)</code> doesn't actually execute.  <code>range(0)</code> returns an empty list <code>[]</code> which will skip the body of your for loop.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Please explain what you think this does?  Please update your question with an English-language explanation of how many times you think this look will work.</p>

<pre><code>counter = 0
for i in range(0):
    if (Bal * Int) == Tar:
        print '1'
    else:
        counter + 1
</code></pre>

<p>Hint.  The answer is zero.  The question is "why?"  and "what were you trying to do?"</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>You have been told the three or more problems with your code. If there's no particular reason to use a loop, it's better calculated with a formula:</p>

<pre><code>future_value = present_value * (1 + interest_rate_per_period) ** number_of periods
</code></pre>

<p>or, for short, </p>

<pre><code>f = p * (1 + i) ** n
f / p = (1 + i) ** n
log(f / p) = n * log(1 + i)
n = log(f / p) / log(i + i)
</code></pre>

<p>Example: I have $5000; how many years will it take to grow to $10000 at 10% per annum?</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from math import log
&gt;&gt;&gt; f = 10000.0
&gt;&gt;&gt; p = 5000.0
&gt;&gt;&gt; i = 0.1
&gt;&gt;&gt; n = log(f / p) / log(1 + i)
&gt;&gt;&gt; n
