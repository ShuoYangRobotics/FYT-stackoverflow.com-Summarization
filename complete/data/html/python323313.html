<h3>Question (ID-323313):</h3><h2>Django versus Plone?</h2><p>I plan to read about Django. Should I go with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django%5F%28web%5Fframework%29">Django</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plone%5F%28software%29">Plone</a>?  What makes Django/Plone better than the other?</p>

<p>Edit: From a comment below:</p>

<p>Plone is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content%5Fmanagement%5Fsystem" rel="nofollow">Content Management System</a>. It has a lot of features built-in and you have a working website with workflows, write access, right management, content management and a strong back office out of the box.</p>

<p>But the question is, do you need this? </p>

<p>Plone is great if you need these features because they are tedious to code and it spares your time so you can focus on the other parts of the apps.</p>

<p>The trouble is that Plone is really complex to deeply tweak (my company works 100% with Plone so I can tell...). You can customize everything, but getting your staff to become Plone experts is long and expensive.</p>

<p>What's more, using Plone implies using Zope, which includes the good stuff (Zope admin, the rollback features, cache, etc) and the nasty stuffs (it's resource intensive, you have to deal with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZODB" rel="nofollow">ZODB</a>...).</p>

<h2>Django is a Framework</h2>

<p>Running the Django <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software%5Fframework" rel="nofollow">framework</a>, you have nothing. Well, almost nothing (you can generate an admin BO) but a ton of bricks that are easy to make work together.</p>

<p>With Django, it takes more time to actually have a website, but it's far easier to tweak since you can understand and control everything (hey, you made it yourself!), then plug it to anything.</p>

<p>Django is really intuitive and well documented, the learning curve is smooth. If you don't need a working app out of the box, but you want to hack some really specific features (meaning, not another <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,%5Fread,%5Fupdate%5Fand%5Fdelete" rel="nofollow">CRUD</a> app), you may want to use it.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>At my work, we use both.</p>

<p>Plone has been excellent as a CMS that is aware of security at all times. One problem we've had with CMS's is not being able to keep secret things secret, either due to references to an object, URL fiddling, or search (the big killer). Plone doesn't just protect: it plays dumb. No matter how you ask for something, if you're not supposed to see it, Plone will not let on that it even exists.</p>

<p>However: Plone runs slow if you don't know how to optimize it. It has a steep learning curve, though Plone 3 seems to be helping with that a bit. Customizations, if not done right, can hold you back when it comes to core updates.</p>

<p>Django, while not as robust or security aware, runs much lighter, faster, and scales much more easily. There's less boilerplate to much around with, and getting started is insanely easy. </p>

<p>I would try both. Play, test, see what you can get done. <b>Plug into the communities, as they will be your biggest asset.</b></p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You are not comparing like for like.</p>

<p>We really need to know your use-case.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> O.P.: "I just wanted to know a framework for developing web apps"</p>

<p>Then Django is what you want.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>If you want to build web applications, Django is probably the tool you want.</p>

<p>If you want to do a lot of content management and you'd prefer to have everything like that done for you, you might find it easier going with Plone, but as e-satis said, Plone can be a real pain in the behind when you want to make serious changes.</p>

<p>Django on the other hand doesn't give you that much to start with other than a great library of development tools.</p>

<p>That pain is the price of reusability. You've to learn the Ploneway. What you should do is evaluate if you want to pay for it nor not, although there are great books and the Plone network of consultants and entrepeneur that can solve these problems for you, just check plone.net.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>There is also <a href="https://www.django-cms.org/" rel="nofollow">django-cms</a> wich is actually a CMS, and not just a frameworK:</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Look at Web2py - I like it much more than Django.</p>

<p>I think you'll be impressed. </p>

<p>Plone has a big learning curve, but you are not limited within the realm of a CMS. 
And once you are up to speed (it can take a year in your spare time) it really empowers
you to do whatever functionality you need.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>If you're a developer, the CMS vs. framework debate comes down to:</p>

<ul>
<li>are you making a site for other non technical people to manage content? CMS</li>
<li>are you making a site with lots of content? CMS</li>
<li>are you making a site that uses that can be make using the plugins that exist for a CMS? CMS</li>
</ul>

<p>Plone is a nice CMS. and now with Plone4 is simpler and faster.</p>

<ul>
<li>but making an application? A framework is going to be more flexible and easier to learn than any CMS. - but if you know a CMS then you also know the framework beneath it. Zope2/3 is a nice and Django is nice. Also checkout Pyramid. Very nice.</li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>Just to clarify some of the points made above:</p>

<p>Django is a framework for making <strong>CMS-centric</strong> websites. I.e., it allows you to create customized admins for managing content. You can, of course, use it to create web applications that are not content-centric, but it does really excel at powering custom CMSs. </p>

<p>Plone is more of a "out of the box" CMS. </p>

<p>So, it all depends on your requirements.</p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>Django - is a great framework, and it's really good documented and has a very strong user community. And If you're going to learn developing - django is a perfect choice. </p>

<p>For first time you might struggle through to make it 'seat' in your mind firmly, and after couple of projects you'll build you'll feel like more comfortable with it. Components of django are highly reusable, and there a lot of apps you can <em>easily</em> integrate to your project. Once you've done it and have a ready project with some components, building another one with same functionality takes couple hours, just replacing templates and some settings and you have a working project. </p>

<p>Django-cms - helps a lot, and you can integrate it with tinyMCE and filebrowser and be happy! :)</p>
<br /><b>#10</b><br /><p>Plone is deprecated</p>

<p>zope2 + CMS = plone &lt; Zope3 + CMS = Z3Ext</p>

<p>Z3Ect is cool!!</p>
