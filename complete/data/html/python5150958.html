<p>Any questions?</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The List in Python is heterogeneous - the same list can accept objects of various different types.</p>

<p>There is a snippet <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/576718-homogeneous-list/" rel="nofollow">here</a> which gives you a homogeneous list in Python. No idea how that piece of code would perform however.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Please try a simple</p>

<pre><code>a=[1, "a"]
</code></pre>

<p>and see if it throws an error before asking a question.</p>

<p>Btw, it does not.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I found Fredrik Lundh's <a href="http://effbot.org/zone/python-list.htm" rel="nofollow">tutorial</a> on Python's lists to be very helpful. </p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Your question does not make much sense since <em>everything</em> in Python is an object.
And a list can hold arbitrary instances of objects if needed.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p><strong>Lists</strong> in Python can be heterogeneous, but by the general convention it is preferable that they only contain <em>homogeneous</em> elements. Python <strong>tuples</strong> are the natural data structure for <em>heterogeneous</em> sequences.</p>

<p>Of course you can argue that both tuples and lists are just homogeneous sequences of Python objects, but that is a misleading oversimplification and doesn't add any value.</p>

<p>Since tuples are <strong>immutable</strong> and lists are <strong>mutable</strong> you could also argue that mutability is the real distinction between them. However, that is not how they were intended. More on this can be found in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/626759/whats-the-difference-between-list-and-tuples-in-python">this question</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>It depends if you talk about the direct elements of a list or its indirect elements.</p>

<p>I believe that a list is in reality a list of references, not of objects, and that when the interpeter has to use a list, it knows that in fact it must manipulate the objects to which the references are pointing, not the references themselves: that's the "execution model" of Python, I think.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What I call <strong>indirect element</strong> of a
list are the <strong>objects</strong> that
constitute the <strong>value of the list</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>What I call <strong>direct elements</strong> are the <strong>references</strong> to these objects  that constitutes the <strong>implementation</strong> of the list.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>considered as a <strong>list of
references</strong>, a list is
<strong>homogenous</strong>: all the elements are variables, in the plain sense of
variable = chunk of memory whose
value can change (while the value of
an object never changes)</p></li>
<li><p>considered as a <strong>list of the objects</strong>
pointed by the references, a list is
<strong>heterogenous</strong>. The innuendo being that their TYPES are heterogenous.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That's my understanding. I don't know if I am fully right.</p>
