<h3>Question (ID-8719643):</h3><h2>google python exercises</h2><p>I'm watching the instructional videos on you youtube and started doing some of the exercises at <a href="http://code.google.com/edu/languages/google-python-class" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/edu/languages/google-python-class</a> but I'm puzzled by the below problem in the string1.py file.
What I can't seem to understand is, what is the "s" in both_ends(s): doing?</p>

<pre><code># B. both_ends
# Given a string s, return a string made of the first 2
# and the last 2 chars of the original string,
# so 'spring' yields 'spng'. However, if the string length
# is less than 2, return instead the empty string.

def both_ends(s):
  # +++your code here+++
  # LAB(begin solution)
  if len(s) &lt; 2:
    return ''
  first2 = s[0:2]
  last2 = s[-2:]
  return first2 + last2
</code></pre>

<p>At the bottom of strings1.py there are some functions:</p>

<pre><code>def main()

    print 'both_ends'
    test(both_ends('spring'), 'spng')

if __name__ == '__main__':
  main()
</code></pre>

<p>So how does the program know to substitute "spring" for (s) or is that not what it's doing? I can post the entire file if need be. It's only 140 lines.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>'spring' is the literal string passed as a parameter into function both_ends(), and 's' is the formal parameter to the function. Replacing a formal parameter with an actual parameter is performed when the function is called.
The 'test()' function is just there to confirm that the function behaves as expected.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>When you call a function, the values you give the function are assigned to the corresponding arguments in the function header. In code:</p>

<pre><code>def my_func(a): #function header; first argument is called a. 
                #a is not a string, but a variable.
    print a     #do something with the argument

my_func(20)     #calling my_func with a value of 20. 20 is assigned to a in the
                #body of the function.
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><code>s</code> is a variable that we presume to hold a string.  We pass <code>'spring'</code> in through as a parameter.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p><code>s</code> in <code>def both_ends(s)</code> is the parameter for the input string. The length of this string is checked with the call to <code>len(s) &lt; 2</code>, and various characters in the string are accessed by position with <code>s[0:2]</code> and <code>s[-2:]</code></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>See <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions</a> for specifics. Also the tutorial at <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/tutorial/index.html</a> is pretty good - I mostly learnt from it.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p><code>s</code> is the parameter to the function, but you plug in real strings like <code>hello</code> or <code>world</code> into the function instead of just the letter <code>s</code>. Think of it like a math function: you have <code>f(x) = x + 5</code>. When you plug in a number, say <code>2</code>, you get <code>f(2) = 2 + 5</code>. That's exactly what happens with the both_ends function. To make it simpler, here's some code:</p>

<pre><code>def f(x):
    return x + 5

f(2)
</code></pre>

<p>The way you plug into the function in the code here is the same way you plug a string into your original function.</p>
