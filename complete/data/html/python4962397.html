<h3>Question (ID-4962397):</h3><h2>Is this normal behaviour for an OO language?</h2><p>I've defined this class:</p>

<pre><code>class RequiredFormSet(BaseFormSet):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super(RequiredFormSet, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
</code></pre>

<p>And overridden this method:</p>

<pre><code>def total_form_count(self):
    return self._total_form_count
</code></pre>

<p>It so happens that <code>super(...).__init__</code> uses <code>total_form_count()</code> somewhere in that function. It's calling <em>my</em> function rather than the one defined in the base class.</p>

<p>I guess I thought because I called <code>super()</code> it would use its own stuff, but apparently in Python that's not true. Is this the way it works in other languages, like C#? If I call the base constructor, it will still call all the derived functions from there?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Yes, this is typical OOP behavior (polymorphism) to have subclass methods invoked by dynamic dispatch. This is part of the reason why C# requires the programmer to mark an overridable method as <code>virtual</code>. I'm sure you're familiar with this notion in general, and the surprise mainly comes from the fact that this is happening in a constructor.</p>

<p>As you have observed, this can be very dangerous in constructors because a superclass's constructor can invoke a subclass's method that may rely on properties initialized in the subclass's constructor. This problem is explicitly noted in Effective Java, and you can read more about it here: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3404301/whats-wrong-with-overridable-method-calls-in-constructors">What's wrong with overridable method calls in constructors?</a></p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>This is normal behavior.  Note the first argument: <em>self</em>.  That's a reference to the object the methods are being called on, so even when you call a superclass method, any overridden methods <em>that</em> method calls will be the subclass methods.</p>

<p>The only way I know of to force it to use a superclass method is with an unbound reference, ie <code>SuperClass.overridenMethod(self, param1, param2)</code>...</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Have you heard of polymorphism? If not, you have no idea what OOP is about and should look it up.</p>

<p>The <code>self</code> the base class constructor uses is of course an instance of the derived class (the <em>same</em> <code>self</code>), so when it calls <code>self.m()</code>, the implementation of <code>m</code> is dispatched dynamically. Some OO languages require explicit annotation of methods that are dispatched dynamically (<code>virtual</code> keyword) - although (as @Doc Brown pointed out) it doesn't work in constructors specifically in C++ - while others make it the default. Anyway, polymorphism is an essential part of OOP and although it's possible in some languages to get static dispatch, polymorphism is the <em>only</em> option in many languages and the generally preferred way in all others. So yes, this is the normal behaviour.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>This is normal behaviour in python, C# has the same behaviour (for virtual functions), C++ has not (some people consider that as a design flaw of C++). In C++, it makes a difference if you call an overriden virtual function from the constructor or from another member function. The reason for that is that when the constructor of a superclass runs, the V-table is not complete.  </p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>In C++, you can choose between the two behaviors based on whether <code>total_form_count</code> is declared <code>virtual</code> or not.  But in Python, all methods behave like <code>virtual</code>: the object will always use the methods from the actual type of the object.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>In C++ the constructor is a kind of special case, the calls to virtual methods result in calling the methods of the class itself (not the one at the leaf of the virtual chain).</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Yes, it's a behaviour called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_in_object-oriented_programming" rel="nofollow">polymorphism</a>. Method lookup in every OOP language is done from the class of the object instance, not the one where the code resides.</p>
