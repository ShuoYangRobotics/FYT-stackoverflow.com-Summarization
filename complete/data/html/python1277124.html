<h3>Question (ID-1277124):</h3><h2>How do you install lxml on OS X Leopard without using MacPorts or Fink?</h2><p>I've tried this and run in to problems a bunch of times in the past. Does anyone have a  recipe for installing lxml on OS X without MacPorts or Fink that definitely works?</p>

<p>Preferably with complete 1-2-3 steps for downloading and building each of the dependencies.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-11):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Thanks to @jessenoller on Twitter I have an answer that fits my needs - you can compile lxml with static dependencies, hence avoiding messing with the libxml2 that ships with OS X. Here's what worked for me:</p>

<pre><code>cd /tmp
wget http://lxml.de/files/lxml-2.2.2.tgz
tar -xzvf lxml-2.2.2.tgz 
cd lxml-2.2.2
cd libs/
wget ftp://xmlsoft.org/libxml2/libxml2-2.7.3.tar.gz
wget ftp://xmlsoft.org/libxml2/libxslt-1.1.24.tar.gz
cd ..
python setup.py build --static-deps --libxml2-version=2.7.3  --libxslt-version=1.1.24 
sudo python setup.py install
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>This worked for me (10.6.8):</p>

<pre><code>sudo env ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch x86_64" easy_install lxml
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Easy_install <em>can</em> work using this:</p>

<p>STATIC_DEPS=true easy_install 'lxml>=2.2beta4'</p>

<p>you may <em>then</em> need to run, depending on permissions;</p>

<p>STATIC_DEPS=true sudo easy_install 'lxml>=2.2beta4'</p>

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I've had excellent luck with <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/" rel="nofollow">Homebrew</a> to install the <code>libxml2</code> dependency:</p>

<pre><code>brew install libxml2
</code></pre>

<p>Homebrew doesn't seem to have <code>libxslt</code> available, but I've not yet had a need for XSLT. YMMV.</p>

<p>Once you have the dependency(s), then the usual methods work just fine:</p>

<pre><code>pip install lxml
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>easy_install lxml
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Try installing Cython and installing from source, easy_install does fail. I haven't tried on my mac yet though.</p>

<p>Failing that the ports version isn't that ancient. You can see the dependencies, some of which had to be updated for my Linux build of lxml.</p>

<p>info py25-lxml
py25-lxml @2.1.5 (python, devel)</p>

<p>lxml is a Pythonic binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries. It is unique
in that it combines the speed and feature completeness of these libraries with
the simplicity of a native Python API, mostly compatible but superior to the
well-known ElementTree API.

<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>This is quite up to date - march 2009:  <a href="http://lsimons.wordpress.com/2008/08/31/how-to-install-lxml-python-module-on-mac-os-105-leopard/" rel="nofollow">http://lsimons.wordpress.com/2008/08/31/how-to-install-lxml-python-module-on-mac-os-105-leopard/</a></p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>lxml is <a href="http://code.activestate.com/pypm/lxml/" rel="nofollow">included</a> in the <a href="http://docs.activestate.com/activepython/2.7/pypm.html" rel="nofollow">pypm</a> repository:</p>

<pre><code>$ pypm install lxml
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>I had this working fine with Snow Lepoard but after I upgraded to Lion I had to symlink gcc-4.2 to gcc.  Running sudo env ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch x86_64" easy_install lxml was looking for gcc-4.2 instead of gcc.</p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>Have you tried with easy_install? </p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>I don't own a Mac so I can't test it, but easy_install is almost considered the standard way to install python modules, so if you don't know it you should have a look at it.</p>
<br /><b>#10</b><br /><p>I compile it in <code>/usr/local</code> without any issues whatsoever.</p>

<p>Install Python, libxml2, libxslt and then lxml. You might need setuptools installed too.</p>
