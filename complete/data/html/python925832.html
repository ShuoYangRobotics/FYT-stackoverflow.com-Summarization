<h3>Question (ID-925832):</h3><h2>Jump into a Python Interactive Session mid-program?</h2><p>Hey I was wondering... I am using the pydev with eclipse and I'm really enjoying the powerful debugging features, but I was wondering:</p>

<p><strong>Is it possible to set a breakpoint in eclipse and jump into the interactive python interpreter during execution?</strong></p>

<p>I think that would be pretty handy ;)</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong>: I want to emphasize that my goal is not to jump into a debugger. pydev/eclipse have a great debugger, and I can just look at the traceback and set break points.</p>

<p>What I want is to execute a script and jump into an interactive python interpreter during execution so I can do things like... </p>

<ul>
<li>poke around</li>
<li>check the values of things</li>
<li>manipulate variables</li>
<li>figure out some code before I add it to the app</li>
</ul>

<p>I know you can do this all with a debugger, but I can do it faster in the interactive interpreter because I can try something, see that it didn't work, and try something else without having get the app back to the point of executing that code again.</p>

<p><strong>edit by Jim Robert (question owner)</strong>: If you place the above code into a file called <code>my_debug.py</code> for the sake of this example. Then place that file in your python path, and you can insert the following lines anywhere in your code to jump into a debugger (as long as you execute from a shell):</p>

<pre><code>import my_debug
my_debug.db()

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>So roughly a year on from the OP's question, PyDev has this capability built in. I am not sure when this feature was introduced, but all I know is I've spent the last ~2hrs Googling... configuring iPython and whatever (which was looking like it would have done the job), but only to realise Eclipse/PyDev has what I want ootb.</p>

<p>As soon as you hit a breakpoint in debug mode, the console is right there ready and waiting!
I only didn't notice this as there is no prompt or blinking cursor; I had wrongly assumed it was a standard, output-only, console... but it's not. It even has code-completion.</p>

<p>Great stuff, see <a href="http://pydev.org/manual_adv_debug_console.html" rel="nofollow">http://pydev.org/manual_adv_debug_console.html</a> for more details.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I've long been using this code in my <code>sitecustomize.py</code> to start a debugger on an exception. This can also be triggered by Ctrl+C. It works beautifully in the shell, don't know about eclipse. </p>

<pre><code>import sys

def info(exception_type, value, tb):
   if hasattr(sys, 'ps1') or not sys.stderr.isatty() or not sys.stdin.isatty() or not sys.stdout.isatty() or type==SyntaxError:
      # we are in interactive mode or we don't have a tty-like
      # device, so we call the default hook
      sys.__excepthook__(exception_type, value, tb)
   else:
      import traceback
      import pdb


      if exception_type != KeyboardInterrupt:
          try:
              import growlnotify
              growlnotify.growlNotify("Script crashed", sticky = False)
          except ImportError:
              pass

      # we are NOT in interactive mode, print the exception...
      traceback.print_exception(exception_type, value, tb)
      print
      # ...then start the debugger in post-mortem mode.
      pdb.pm()

sys.excepthook = info
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/65287/" rel="nofollow">source</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/242485/starting-python-debugger-automatically-on-error">more discussion on StackOverflow</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You can jump into an interactive session using <code>code.InteractiveConsole</code> as described <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/355319/" rel="nofollow">here</a>; however I don't know how to trigger this from Eclipse.</p>

<p>A solution might be to intercept Ctrl+C to jump into this interactive console (using the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/signal.html" rel="nofollow">signal</a> module: <code>signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, my_handler)</code>), but it would probably change the execution context and you probably don't want this.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Not truely an answer to your question, but just a pointer to iPython. Just in case you aren't aware of it. I use it side-by-side with eclipse/pydev for just such things.</p>

<p>Of relevence is this info on embedding <a href="http://ipython.scipy.org/doc/manual/html/interactive/reference.html#embedding" rel="nofollow">iPython</a> into your own app. This provides the ability to do what you are looking for if you are willing to do it outside of eclipse/pydev.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>If you are already running in debug mode you can set an additional breakpoint if the program execution is currently paused (e.g. because you are already at a breakpoint). I just tried it out now with the latest Pydev - it works just fine. </p>

<p>If you are running normally (i.e. not in debug mode) all breakpoints will be ignored. No changes to breakpoints will alter the way a non-debug run works.</p>
