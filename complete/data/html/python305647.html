<h3>Question (ID-305647):</h3><h2>Appropriate location for my application's cache on Windows</h2><p>My application caches some data on disk.  Because the cache may be large, it should not be stored on a network drive.  It should persist between invocations of the application.  I have a mechanism for the user to choose a location, but would like the default to be sensible and "the right thing" for the platform.</p>

<p>What is the appropriate location for such a cache?  Is there an API for determining the appropriate location?  How do I call it from Python?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>There are a number a places you can put your application files in Windows.  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.environment.specialfolder.aspx" rel="nofollow">This page</a> shows a list (this enum is .Net specific but most of the special folders are standard on Windows in general).  Basically you'll need to decide if you need a cache per user, only for the local machine, per application or shared, etc.</p>

<p>I don't have much experience with python so I cannot specifically help with how to get these paths, but I'm sure someone more knowledgeable here can. </p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The standard location for Windows application to store their (permanent) application data is referenced by the <code>%APPDATA%</code> (current user) or <code>%ALLUSERSPROFILE%</code> (all users) environment variables. You can access them using, e.g. (only rudimentary and not very elegant error checking!):</p>

<pre><code>import os
app_path = os.getenv("APPDATA") + "\\MyApplicationData"
try:
    os.mkdir(app_path)
except WindowsError:
    # already exists
</code></pre>

<p>Now you have your own directory for your app. </p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Have a look here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable#User_management_variables" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable#User_management_variables</a>. Anything that's under the users directory is good. If its for all users, then it should be: %ALLUSERSPROFILE%. If its for a specific user, make sure the permissions are right.</p>

<p>Check out MSDN for more info about other Windows Versions. Environment variables can vary from systems to systems.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Perhaps the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/tempfile.html" rel="nofollow"><code>tempfile</code></a> module provides what you need. It uses the Windows Temp directory (which probably is not on a network drive) but you can specify a directory if you want to. Also for security reasons this module should be the right tool - if you use <code>tempfile.mkstemp()</code> the file is readable and writable only by the creating user ID.</p>

<p>Oh. I see you have just edited your question and that you need file persistence between invocations of the app. Then <code>tempfile</code> is not that ideal (even though you could choose not to delete your cache between invocations).</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>The <a href="http://wxpython.org/docs/api/wx.StandardPaths-class.html" rel="nofollow"><code>wx.StandardPaths</code></a> module contains methods that return various standard locations in the file system and transparently tries to do "the right thing" under Unix, Mac OS X, and Windows.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Does the app have any preferences, settings or options that the user can specify? If so, add an option where the user can specify the location of the data, with a default of the current Windows temp directory.</p>

<p>There's always a chance they may not have enough space on the drive with the temp directory, and would need to use a different drive/directory.</p>
