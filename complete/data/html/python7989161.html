<h3>Question (ID-7989161):</h3><h2>How to understand this code, to split an array in Python?</h2><p>I'm a bit confused about a line in Python:</p>

<p>We use Python and a custom function to split a line: we want what is between quotes to be a single entry in the array.</p>

<p>The line is, for example: </p>

<pre><code>"La Jolla Bank, FSB",La Jolla,CA,32423,19-Feb-10,24-Feb-10
</code></pre>

<p>So "La Jolla Bank, FSB" should be a single entry in the array.</p>

<p>And I'm not sure to understand this code: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>The first char is a quote '<code>"</code>', so the variable "quote" is set to its inverse, so set to "TRUE".</p></li>
<li><p>Then we check the comma, AND if quote is set to its inverse, so if quote is TRUE, which is the case when we are inside the quotes. </p></li>
<li><p>We cut it with <code>current=""</code>, and this is where I don't understand: we are still between the quotes, so normally we should not cut it now! edit: so and not quote means "false", and not "the opposite of", thanks !</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Code:</p>

<pre><code>def mysplit (string):
    quote = False
    retval = []
    current = ""
    for char in string:
        if char == '"':
            quote = not quote
        elif char == ',' and not quote: #the first coma is still in the quotes, and quote is set to TRUE, so we should not cut current here...
            retval.append(current) 
            current = "" 
        else:
            current += char
    retval.append(current)
    return retval
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You're viewing it as though both <code>if char == '"'</code> and <code>elif char == ',' and not quote</code> were run.</p>

<p>However the if statement explicitly makes it so that only one will run.</p>

<p>Either, quote will be inverted OR the <code>current</code> value will get cut.</p>

<p>In the case where the current char is <code>"</code>, then the logic will be called to invert the <code>quote</code> flag.  But the logic to cut the string will not run.</p>

<p>In the case where the current char is <code>,</code>, then the logic for inverting the flag will NOT run, but the logic to cut the string will if the <code>quote</code> flag is not set.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>That is initializing <code>current</code> to the empty string, wiping out whatever it may have been set to before.</p>

<p>As long as you are not inside quotes (ie. <code>quote</code> is False), when you see a <code>,</code>, you have hit the end of the field.  Whatever you have accumulated into <code>current</code> is the content of that field, so append it to <code>retval</code> and reset <code>current</code> to the empty string, ready for the next field.</p>

<p>That said, this looks like you're dealing with a .csv input.  There is a <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow">csv module</a> that can deal with this for you.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>current is reset to empty because in the case where you have encountered ',' and you are not under "" quotes you should interpret that as an end of a "token".</p>

<p>This is definitely not pythonic, <code>for char in string</code> makes me cringe and whoever wrote this code should have used regex.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>What you're looking at is a condensed version of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine" rel="nofollow">Finite State Machine</a>, used by most language parsing programs.</p>

<p>Let's see if I can't annotate it:</p>

<pre><code>def mysplit (string):
    # We start out at the beginning of the string NOT in between quotes
    quote = False
    # Hold each element that we split out
    retval = []
    # This variable holds  whatever the current item we're interested in is
    # e.g: If we're in a quote, then it's everything (including commas)
    # otherwise it's every UP UNTIL the next comma
    current = ""
    # Scan the string character by character
    for char in string:
        # We hit a quote, so turn on QUOTE SCANNING MODE!!!
        # If we're in quote scanning mode, turn it off
        if char == '"':
            quote = not quote
        # We hit a comma, and we're not in quote scanning mode
        elif char == ',' and not quote:
            # We got what we want, let's put it in the return value
            # and then reset our current item to nothing so we can prepare for the next item.
            retval.append(current) 
            current = "" 
        else:
            # Nothing special, let's just keep building up our current item
            current += char
    # We're done with all the characters, let's put together whatever we were working on when we ran out of characters
    retval.append(current)
    # Return it!
    return retval
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>This is not the best code for splitting but it is pretty straight forward     </p>

<pre><code>   1 current = ""

   # First you set current to empty string, the following line
   # will loop through the string to be split and pull characters out of it
   # one by one... setting 'char' to be the value of next character

   2 for char in string:

   # the following code will check if the line we are currently inside of the quote
   # if otherwise it will add the current character to the the 'current' variable
   # 

   3     if char == '"':
   4         quote = not quote
   5     elif char == ',' and not quote:
   6         retval.append(current) 

   ### if we see the comma, it will append whatever is accumulated in current to the 
   ### return result.
   ### then you have to reset the value in the current to let the next word accumulate


   7         current = "" #why do we cut current here? 
   8     else:
   9         current += char

   ### after the last char is seen, we still have left over characters in current which
   ### we can just shove into the final result

   10 retval.append(current)
   11 return retval


   Here is an example run:

   Let string be  'a,bbb,ccc

   Step  char  current   retval

    1     a      a        {}
    2     ,               {a}       ### Current is reset
    3     b      b        {a}
    4     b      bb       {a} 
    5     b      bbb      {a}
    6     ,               {a,bbb}   ### Current is reset

   and so on

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>OK you aren't quite there!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1.the first char is a quote
  ' " ', so the variable "quote" is set to its inverse, so set to
  "TRUE". </p>
</blockquote>

<p>good! so quote was set to the inverse of whatever it was previously. At the beginning of the prog, it was false, so when <code>"</code> is seen, it becomes true. But vice versa, if it was True, and a quote is seen, it becomes false.</p>

<p>In other words, this line of the program changes <code>quote</code> from whatever is was before that line. It is called 'toggling'.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>then we check the coma, AND if quote is set to its inverse,
  so if quote is TRUE, which is the case when we are inside the quotes.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn't quite right. <code>not quote</code> means "only if quote is false". This has nothing to do with whether it is <em>'set to its inverse'</em>. <strong>No</strong> variable can be equal to its own inverse! it is like saying <code>X=True and X=False</code> - obviously nonsense.</p>

<p><code>quote</code> is always either <code>True</code> or <code>False</code> - and nothing else!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3.we cut it with current="", and this is where i don't understand : we are still between the quotes, so norm ally we should not cut it now!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So hopefully you can see now that, you are not between the quotes if you reach this line. the <code>not quote</code> ensures that you don't cut inside a quote, because <code>not quote</code> really means just that - <strong>not</strong> in a quote!</p>
