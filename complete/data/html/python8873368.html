<h3>Question (ID-8873368):</h3><h2>How many common English words of 4 letters or more can you make from the letters of a given word (each letter can only be used once)</h2><p>On the back of a block calendar I found the following riddle:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How many common English words of 4 letters or more can you make from the letters
  of the word 'textbook' (each letter can only be used once).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My first solution that I came up with was:</p>

<pre><code>from itertools import permutations

with open('/usr/share/dict/words') as f:
    words = f.readlines()

words = map(lambda x: x.strip(), words)

given_word = 'textbook'

found_words = []

ps = (permutations(given_word, i) for i in range(4, len(given_word)+1))

for p in ps:
    for word in map(''.join, p):
        if word in words and word != given_word:
            found_words.append(word)
print set(found_words)  
</code></pre>

<p>This gives the result <code>set(['tote', 'oboe', 'text', 'boot', 'took', 'toot', 'book', 'toke', 'betook'])</code> but took more than 7 minutes on my machine.</p>

<p>My next iteration was:</p>

<pre><code>with open('/usr/share/dict/words') as f:
    words = f.readlines()

words = map(lambda x: x.strip(), words)

given_word = 'textbook'

print [word for word in words if len(word) &gt;= 4 and sorted(filter(lambda letter: letter in word, given_word)) == sorted(word) and word != given_word]
</code></pre>

<p>Which return an answer almost immediately but gave as answer: <code>['book', 'oboe', 'text', 'toot']</code> </p>

<p>What is the fastest, correct and most pythonic solution to this problem?</p>

<p>(<strong>edit</strong>: added my earlier permutations solution and its different output).</p>

<pre><code>from itertools import permutations, chain

with open('/usr/share/dict/words') as fp:
    words = set(fp.read().split())

given_word = 'textbook'

perms = (permutations(given_word, i) for i in range(4, len(given_word)+1))
pwords = (''.join(p) for p in chain(*perms))
matches = words.intersection(pwords)

print matches
</code></pre>

<p>which gives</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print matches
set(['textbook', 'keto', 'obex', 'tote', 'oboe', 'text', 'boot', 'toto', 'took', 'koto', 'bott', 'tobe', 'boke', 'toot', 'book', 'bote', 'otto', 'toke', 'toko', 'oket'])

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I thought I'd share this slightly interesting trick although it takes a good bit more code than the rest and isn't really "pythonic". This will take a good bit more code than the other solutions but should be rather quick if I look at the timing the others need. </p>

<p>We're doing a bit preprocessing to speed up the computations. The basic approach is the following: We assign every letter in the alphabet a prime number. E.g. A = 2, B = 3, and so on. We then compute a hash for every word in the alphabet which is simply the product of the prime representations of every character in the word. We then store every word in a dictionary indexed by the hash.</p>

<p>Now if we want to find out which words are equivalent to say <code>textbook</code> we only have to compute the same hash for the word and look it up in our dictionary. Usually (say in C++) we'd have to worry about overflows, but in python it's even simpler than that: Every word in the list with the same index will contain exactly the same characters.</p>

<p>Here's the code with the slightly optimization that in our case we only have to worry about characters also appearing in the given word, which means we can get by with a much smaller prime table than otherwise (the obvious optimization would be to only assign characters that appear in the word a value at all - it was fast enough anyhow so I didn't bother and this way we could pre process only once and do it for several words). The prime algorithm is useful often enough so you should have one yourself anyhow ;) </p>

<pre><code>from collections import defaultdict
from itertools import permutations

PRIMES = list(gen_primes(256)) # some arbitrary prime generator

def get_dict(path):
    res = defaultdict(list)
    with open(path, "r") as file:
        for line in file.readlines():
            word = line.strip().upper()
            hash = compute_hash(word)
            res[hash].append(word)
    return res

def compute_hash(word):
    hash = 1
    for char in word:
        try:
            hash *= PRIMES[ord(char) - ord(' ')]
        except IndexError:
            # contains some character out of range - always 0 for our purposes
            return 0
    return hash

def get_result(path, given_word):
    words = get_dict(path)
    given_word = given_word.upper()
    result = set()
    powerset = lambda x: powerset(x[1:]) + [x[:1] + y for y in powerset(x[1:])] if x else [x]
    for word in (word for word in powerset(given_word) if len(word) &gt;= 4):
        hash = compute_hash(word)
        for equiv in words[hash]:
            result.add(equiv)
    return result

if __name__ == '__main__':
    path = "dict.txt"
    given_word = "textbook"
    result = get_result(path, given_word)
    print(result)

<p>Runs on my ubuntu word list (98k words) rather quickly, but not what I'd call pythonic since it's basically a port of a c++ algorithm. Useful if you want to compare more than one word that way..</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>There is a generator <code>itertools.permutations</code> with which you can gather all permutations of a sequence with a specified length. That makes it easier:</p>

<pre><code>from itertools import permutations

GIVEN_WORD = 'textbook'

with open('/usr/share/dict/words', 'r') as f:
    words = [s.strip() for s in f.readlines()]

print len(filter(lambda x: ''.join(x) in words, permutations(GIVEN_WORD, 4)))
</code></pre>

<p>Edit #1: Oh! It says "4 or more" ;) Forget what I said!</p>

<p>Edit #2: This is the second version I came up with:</p>

<pre><code>LETTERS = set('textbook')

with open('/usr/share/dict/words') as f:
    WORDS = filter(lambda x: len(x) &gt;= 4, [l.strip() for l in f])

matching = filter(lambda x: set(x).issubset(LETTERS) and all([x.count(c) == 1 for c in x]), WORDS)
print len(matching)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Create the whole power set, then check whether the dictionary word is in the set (order of the letters doesn't matter):</p>

<pre><code>powerset = lambda x: powerset(x[1:]) + [x[:1] + y for y in powerset(x[1:])] if x else [x]

pw = map(lambda x: sorted(x), powerset(given_word))
filter(lambda x: sorted(x) in pw, words)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>The following just checks each word in the dictionary to see if it is of the appropriate length, and then if it is a permutation of 'textbook'. I borrowed the permutation check from 
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/396421/checking-if-two-strings-are-permutations-of-each-other-in-python">Checking if two strings are permutations of each other in Python</a>
but changed it slightly.</p>

<pre><code>given_word = 'textbook'

with open('/usr/share/dict/words', 'r') as f:
    words = [s.strip() for s in f.readlines()]

matches = []
for word in words:
    if word != given_word and 4 &lt;= len(word) &lt;= len(given_word):
        if all(word.count(char) &lt;= given_word.count(char) for char in word):
            matches.append(word)
print sorted(matches)
</code></pre>

<p>This finishes almost immediately and gives the correct result.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Permutations get very big for longer words. Try <em>counterrevolutionary</em> for example. </p>

<p>I would filter the dict for words from 4 to len(word) (8 for textbook). 
Then I would filter with regular expression "oboe".matches ("[textbook]+"). </p>

<p>The remaining words, I would sort, and compare them with a sorted version of your word, ("beoo", "bekoottx") with jumping to the next index of a matching character, to find mismatching numbers of characters: </p>

<pre><code>("beoo", "bekoottx") 
("eoo", "ekoottx") 
("oo", "koottx") 
("oo", "oottx") 
("o", "ottx") 
("", "ttx") =&gt; matched


("bbo", "bekoottx") 
("bo", "ekoottx") =&gt; mismatch
</code></pre>

<p>Since I don't talk python, I leave the implementation as an exercise to the audience. </p>
