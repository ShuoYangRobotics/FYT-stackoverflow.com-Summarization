<h3>Question (ID-1540214):</h3><h2>Can Python be used for client side web development?</h2><p>If yes are there any frameworks/Tutorials/tips/etc recommended? </p>

<p>N00b at Python but I have tons of PHP experience and wanted to expand my skill set.</p>

<p>I know Python is great at server side execution, just wanted to know about client side as well.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You can use <a href="http://pyjs.org/" rel="nofollow">pyjamas</a> to convert Python code to JS code that runs in the browser (note that pyjamas also offers much more). So YES, you can use Python for client side web development.</p>

<p>Pyjamas is basically a port of the <a href="http://code.google.com/intl/de/webtoolkit/" rel="nofollow">Google Web Toolkit</a>, which allows you to write client side code in Java.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Python isn't really used for client side, because no major web browsers have Python built in.</p>

<p>However, Javascript has become more and more Python-like as it has evolved.  You might want to study Python and Javascript together.</p>

<p>Take a look at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/New_in_JavaScript_1.7" rel="nofollow">https://developer.mozilla.org/en/New_in_JavaScript_1.7</a> and notice the Python-like nature of the new features.  "array comprehensions" are just like Python list comprehensions; iterators and generators are straight out of Python; "destructuring assignments" are a standard Python idiom.</p>

<p>Javascript is kind of like Python with curly braces.  It uses a very different inheritance model, but libraries are available that implement a more Python-like class system on top of the built-in system in Javascript.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Silverlight can run IronPython, so you can make Silverlight applications. Which is client-side.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Have a look at this:</p>

<p>It's an interactive python console + tutorial written with Silverlight+IronPython.</p>

<p>"Grail was a free extensible multi-platform web browser written in the Python programming language. The project was started in August 1995, with its first public release in November of that year. [1] The .3 beta contained over 27,000 lines of Python.[1] Its last release was of version 0.6 in 1999, with latest version under development."</p>

<p>If its client side your interested may be worth checking out</p>

<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>On Windows, any language that registers for the Windows Scripting Host can run in IE. At least the ActiveState version of Python could do that; I seem to recall that has been superseded by a more official version these days.</p>

<p>But that solution requires the user to install a python interpreter and run some script or .reg file to put the correct "magic" into the registry for the hooks to work.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>No. Browsers don't run Python.</p>
