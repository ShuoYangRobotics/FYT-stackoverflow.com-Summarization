<h3>Question (ID-295670):</h3><h2>What is a partial class?</h2><p>What is and how can it be used in C#.<br/>
Can you use the same concept in Python/Perl?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>A <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wa80x488.aspx" rel="nofollow">partial type</a> (it doesn't have to be a class; structs and interfaces can be partial too) is basically a single type which has its code spread across multiple files.</p>

<p>The main use for this is to allow a code generator (e.g. a Visual Studio designer) to "own" one file, while hand-written code is put in another.</p>

<p>I've no idea whether Python/Perl have the same capabilities, I'm afraid.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The c# partial class has been already explained here so I'll just cover the python part. You can use multiple inheritance to elegantly distribute the definition of a class.</p>

<pre><code>class A_part1:
    def m1(self):
        print "m1"

class A_part2:
    def m2(self):
        print "m2"

class A(A_part1, A_part2):
    pass

a = A()
a.m1()
a.m2()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>A partial class is simply a class that's contained in more than one file.  Sometimes it's so that one part can be machine-generated, and another part user-edited.</p>

<p>I use them in C# when I'm making a class that's getting a bit too large.  I'll put the accessors and constructors in one file, and all of the interesting methods in a different file.</p>

<p>In Perl, you'd simply have two (or more) files that each declare themselves to be in a package:</p>

<p>(main program)</p>

<pre><code>    use MyClass;
</code></pre>

<p>(in MyClass.pm)</p>

<pre><code>    use MyClassOtherStuff;
    package MyClass;
    # [..class code here...]
</code></pre>

<p>(in MyClassOtherStuff.pm)</p>

<pre><code>    package MyClass;
    # [...rest of code here...]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The concept of partial types have already been explained.</p>

<p>This can be done in python. As an example, do the following in a python shell.</p>

<pre><code>class A(object):
    pass

obj = A()

def _some_method(self):
    print self.__class__
A.identify = _some_method

obj.identify()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Because python is a dynamic language you don't need a concept like partial class. In python is possible to extend object with functionality in runtime so it possible to break class declaration into different files</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>A Partial type is a type whose declaration is separated across multiple files. It makes sense to use them if you have a big class, which is hard to handle and read for a typical developer, to separate that class definition in separate files and to put in each file a logically separated section of code (for instance all public methods and proprieties in one file, private in other, db handling code in third and so on..)</p>

<p>No you don't have the same syntactical element in Python. </p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Python also has meta classes but that is more like a template class than a partial class.  A good example of meta class usage is the Django ORM.  All of your table models inherit from a base model class which also gets functionality included from a meta class.  It is a pretty cool concept that enables an active record like pattern (is it full active record?).</p>
