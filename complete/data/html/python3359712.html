You can find lots of samples and tutorials for fetching urls and processing the returned html in the offical page: <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/" rel="nofollow">http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/</a></p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I strongly recommend taking a look at <a href="http://www.scrapy.org/" rel="nofollow">Scrapy</a>. The library can work with BeautifulSoup, or any of your preferred HTML parser. I personally use it with lxml.html.</p>

<p>Out of the box, you receive several things for free:</p>

<ul>
<li>Concurrent requests, thanks to Twisted</li>
<li><code>CrawlSpider</code> objects recursively look for links in the whole site</li>
<li>Great separation of data extraction &amp; processing, which makes the most of the parallel processing capabilities</li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Why not look for <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/spider.py/0.5" rel="nofollow">existing code</a> that already does what you need? If you need to build one yourself, it's still worth looking at existing code and de-constructing it to figure out how it works.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>If you still want to write one from scratch, you'll want to use the <a href="http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/" rel="nofollow">mechanize</a> module.  It includes everything you need to simulate a browser, and automate the fetching of urls.  I'll be redundant and also say BeautifulSoup for parsing any html you fetch.  Otherwise, I'd go with Scrapy...</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>It depends on your needs. If you need basic webscraping, then mechanize +  BeautifulSoup will make it.</p>

<p>If you need javascript to be rendered, then I would go for Selenium, or <a href="http://code.google.com/p/spynner/" rel="nofollow">spynner</a>. Both are great.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>IBM Developer Works has an article on this <a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-spider/#N101C6" rel="nofollow">https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-spider/#N101C6</a>.  You'll likely want to use the libraries that others have suggested, but this will give you an overall idea of the flow.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Another good library you might need is for parsing feeds. Now that you have BeautifulSoup for urls, you can use Feedparser for the feeds. <a href="http://www.feedparser.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.feedparser.org/</a></p>
