<h3>Question (ID-4108743):</h3><h2>Difference between '' and "" in Python</h2><p>What is the difference between apostrophes and quotation marks in Python?</p>

<p>So far I've only been able to find one difference</p>

<pre><code>print "'"

print '"'

print '''

print """
</code></pre>

<p>The first print statement will output <strong>'</strong> while the second <strong>"</strong>. However the third statement starts a comment block. </p>

<p>Any other differences I should be aware of? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p><code>print 'Hello'</code> and <code>print "Hello"</code> are the same and what you use is your personal preference. <code>"""</code> and <code>'''</code> are for multiline strings. </p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print """First
Second
Third"""

First
Second
Third
</code></pre>

  <p>Python has a facility multiline string that starts with triple quotes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They are also commonly used for docstrings.</p>

<p>An example of multiline string:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = """ wdd2ed
... 2wdqd
... d
... dd
... d
... """
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; print x
 wdd2ed
2wdqd
d
dd
d

&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>String literals can be enclosed in matching single quotes (') or double quotes (").
So "string" and 'string' are same.</p>

<p>The following provides all the details: <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-literals" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-literals</a></p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Triple-quotes aren't for comments, they are the syntax for multi-line strings.  They are often used for docstrings, which serve a similar role as block comments in other languages.  But multi-line strings can be used as data just as the other string syntaxes can.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>'...' strings and "..." are identical except that you don't need to escape <code>'</code> inside a <code>"</code> string, nor vice versa.</p>

<p>Triple quotes start a multi-line string.  These are often used for <a href="http://diveintopython.org/getting_to_know_python/documenting_functions.html" rel="nofollow">docstrings</a>, which is probably where you got the idea that they're comments. </p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p><code>'</code> and <code>"</code> can be used interchangably to start and end a string (be sure to close with the same one you opened with).  It's provided as a convenience so you don't need to escape quote in most cases.</p>

<p>For example, if you wanted the string <code>say "hello"</code> in languages that don't provide the alternative option, you would need to escape it with something like <code>"say \"hello\""</code> which is somewhat ugly compared to <code>'say "hello"'</code>  </p>

<p>Likewise if you could only use <code>'</code> (not sure of any language that does this) then a string to say <code>bill's pony</code> would be <code>'bill\'s pony'</code> instead of <code>"bill's pony"</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Note: in PHP string quoted by single-quotes ' don't interpret escapes like '\n' '\r' etc. In python you can use 'r' modifier. So, <code>str=r'some \n string containing "\n" inside'</code>
 - is RAW string and it does not contain newline characters.</p>
