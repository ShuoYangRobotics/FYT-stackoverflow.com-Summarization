<h3>Question (ID-2247412):</h3><h2>Python best way to check for existing key</h2><p>Which is the more efficient/faster/better way to check if a key exists?</p>

<pre><code>if 'subject' in request.POST:
    subject = request.POST['subject']
else:
    // handle error
</code></pre>

<p>OR</p>

<pre><code>try:
    subject = request.POST['subject']
except KeyError:
    // handle error
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The latter (<code>try/except</code>) form is generally the better form. </p>

<p><code>try</code> blocks are very cheap but catching an exception can be more expensive. A containment check on a dict tends to be cheap, but not cheaper than nothing. I suspect there will be a balance of efficiency depending on how often <code>'subject'</code> is really there. However, <strong>this doesn't matter</strong>, since premature optimization is useless, distracting, wasteful, and ineffective. You would go with the better solution.</p>

<p>If the code would actually be of the form </p>

<pre><code>if 'subject' in request.POST:
    subject = request.POST['subject']
else:
    subject = some_default
</code></pre>

<p>then what you actually want is <code>request.POST.get('subject', some_default)</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The second will fail with <code>collections.defaultdict</code>, and the exception will cause a small performance bump. Other than there there is no real difference between the two.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Last time I checked, the first one is a few nanoseconds faster.  But most phythonistas seem to favor the second one.</p>

<p>I think I'm not the only one that want to reserve exceptions for exceptional behavior, so I try to use the first one, reserving the second one when it's invalid not to have the key</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I think it depends on whether 'subject' not being in POST is actually an exception.  If it is not supposed to happen but you are just being extra careful, then your second method would I assume be more efficient and quicker.  However if you are using the check to do 1 thing or another then it is not appropriate to use an exception.  From the look of your code, I would go with your second option.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I too like get() you can also specify a default value (other than none) in case that makes sense.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I use .get() method â€” it is preferable method.</p>
