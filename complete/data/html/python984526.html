<h3>Question (ID-984526):</h3><h2>Correct way of handling exceptions in Python?</h2><p>I have searched for other posts, as I felt this is a rather common problem, but all other Python exception questions I have found didn't reflect my problem.</p>

<p>I will try to be as specific here as I can, so I will give a direct example. And pleeeeease do not post any workarounds for this specific problem. I am not specifically interested how you can send an email much nicer with xyz.
I want to know how you generally deal with dependent, error prone statements.</p>

<p>My question is, how to handle exceptions nicely, ones that depend on one another, meaning:
Only if the first step was successful, try the next, and so on. One more criterion is: All exceptions have to be caught, this code has to be robust.</p>

<p>For your consideration, an example:</p>

<pre><code>try:
    server = smtplib.SMTP(host) #can throw an exception
except smtplib.socket.gaierror:
    #actually it can throw a lot more, this is just an example
    pass
else: #only if no exception was thrown we may continue
    try:
        server.login(username, password)
    except SMTPAuthenticationError:
        pass # do some stuff here
    finally:
        #we can only run this when the first try...except was successful
        #else this throws an exception itself!
        server.quit() 
    else:
        try:
            # this is already the 3rd nested try...except
            # for such a simple procedure! horrible
            server.sendmail(addr, [to], msg.as_string())
            return True
        except Exception:
            return False
        finally:
            server.quit()

return False
</code></pre>

<p>This looks extremely unpythonic to me, and the error handling code is triple the real business code, but on the other hand how can I handle several statements that are dependent on one another, meaning statement1 is prerequisite for statement2 and so on?</p>

<p>I am also interested in proper resource cleanup, even Python can manage that for itself. </p>

<p>Thanks, Tom</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Instead of using the try/except's else block, you could simply return when it errors:</p>

<pre><code>def send_message(addr, to, msg):
    ## Connect to host
    try:
        server = smtplib.SMTP(host) #can throw an exception
    except smtplib.socket.gaierror:
        return False

    ## Login
    try:
        server.login(username, password)
    except SMTPAuthenticationError:
        server.quit()
        return False

    ## Send message
    try:
        server.sendmail(addr, [to], msg.as_string())
        return True
    except Exception: # try to avoid catching Exception unless you have too
        return False
    finally:
        server.quit()
</code></pre>

<p>That's perfectly readable and Pythonic..</p>

<p>Another way of doing this is, rather than worry about the specific implementation, decide how you want your code to look, for example..</p>

<pre><code>sender = MyMailer("username", "password") # the except SocketError/AuthError could go here
try:
    sender.message("addr..", ["to.."], "message...")
except SocketError:
    print "Couldn't connect to server"
except AuthError:
    print "Invalid username and/or password!"
else:
    print "Message sent!"
</code></pre>

<p>Then write the code for the <code>message()</code> method, catching any errors you expect, and raising your own custom one, and handle that where it's relevant. Your class may look something like..</p>

<pre><code>class ConnectionError(Exception): pass
class AuthError(Exception): pass
class SendError(Exception): pass

class MyMailer:
    def __init__(self, host, username, password):
        self.host = host
        self.username = username
        self.password = password

    def connect(self):
        try:
            self.server = smtp.SMTP(self.host)
        except smtplib.socket.gaierror:
            raise ConnectionError("Error connecting to %s" % (self.host))

    def auth(self):
        try:
            self.server.login(self.username, self.password)
        except SMTPAuthenticationError:
            raise AuthError("Invalid username (%s) and/or password" % (self.username))

    def message(self, addr, to, msg):
        try:
            server.sendmail(addr, [to], msg.as_string())
        except smtplib.something.senderror, errormsg:
            raise SendError("Couldn't send message: %s" % (errormsg))
        except smtp.socket.timeout:
            raise ConnectionError("Socket error while sending message")
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>In general, you want to use as few try blocks as possible, distinguishing failure conditions by the kinds of exceptions they throw.  For instance, here's my refactoring of the code you posted:</p>

<pre><code>try:
    server = smtplib.SMTP(host)
    server.login(username, password) # Only runs if the previous line didn't throw
    server.sendmail(addr, [to], msg.as_string())
    return True
except smtplib.socket.gaierror:
    pass # Couldn't contact the host
except SMTPAuthenticationError:
    pass # Login failed
except SomeSendMailError:
    pass # Couldn't send mail
finally:
    if server:
        server.quit()
return False
</code></pre>

<p>Here, we use the fact that smtplib.SMTP(), server.login(), and server.sendmail() all throw different exceptions to flatten the tree of try-catch blocks.  In the finally block we test server explicitly to avoid invoking quit() on the nil object.</p>

<p>We could also use three <em>sequential</em> try-catch blocks, returning False in the exception conditions, if there are overlapping exception cases that need to be handled separately:</p>

<pre><code>try:
    server = smtplib.SMTP(host)
except smtplib.socket.gaierror:
    return False # Couldn't contact the host

try:
    server.login(username, password)
except SMTPAuthenticationError:
    server.quit()
    return False # Login failed

try:
    server.sendmail(addr, [to], msg.as_string())
except SomeSendMailError:
    server.quit()
    return False # Couldn't send mail

return True
</code></pre>

<p>This isn't quite as nice, as you have to kill the server in more than one place, but now we can handle specific exception types different ways in different places without maintaining any extra state.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If it was me I would probably do something like the following:</p>

<pre><code>try:
    server = smtplib.SMTP(host)
    try:
        server.login(username, password)
        server.sendmail(addr, [to], str(msg))
    finally:
        server.quit()
except:
    debug("sendmail", traceback.format_exc().splitlines()[-1])
    return True
</code></pre>

<p>All errors are caught and debugged, the return value == True on success, and the server connection is properly cleaned up if the initial connection is made.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Just using one try-block is the way to go. This is exactly what they
are designed for: only execute the next statement if the previous
statement did not throw an exception. As for the resource clean-ups,
maybe you can check the resource if it needs to be cleaned up
(e.g. myfile.is_open(), ...) This does add some extra conditions, but
they will only be executed in the exceptional case. To handle the case
that the same Exception can be raised for different reasons, you
should be able to retrieve the reason from the Exception.</p>

<p>I suggest code like this:</p>

<pre><code>server = None
try:
    server = smtplib.SMTP(host) #can throw an exception
    server.login(username, password)
    server.sendmail(addr, [to], msg.as_string())
    server.quit()
    return True
except smtplib.socket.gaierror:
    pass # do some stuff here
except SMTPAuthenticationError:
    pass # do some stuff here
except Exception, msg:
    # Exception can have several reasons
    if msg=='xxx':
        pass # do some stuff here
    elif:
        pass # do some other stuff here

if server:
    server.quit()

return False
</code></pre>

<p>It is no uncommon, that error handling code exceeds business code. Correct error handling can be complex.
But to increase maintainability it helps to separate the business code from the error handling code.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I would try something like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Mailer():

    def send_message(self):
        exception = None
        for method in [self.connect, 
                       self.authenticate, 
                       self.send, 
                       self.quit]:
            try:
                if not method(): break
            except Exception, ex:
                exception = ex
                break

        if method == quit and exception == None:
            return True

        if exception:
            self.handle_exception(method, exception)
        else:
            self.handle_failure(method)

    def connect(self):
        return True

    def authenticate(self):
        return True

    def send(self):
        return True

    def quit(self):
        return True

    def handle_exception(self, method, exception):
        print "{name} ({msg}) in {method}.".format(
           name=exception.__class__.__name__, 
           msg=exception,
           method=method.__name__)

    def handle_failure(self, method):
        print "Failure in {0}.".format(method.__name__)
</code></pre>

<p>All of the methods (including <code>send_message</code>, really) follow the same protocol:  they return True if they succeeded, and unless they actually <em>handle</em> an exception, they don't trap it.  This protocol also makes it possible to handle the case where a method needs to indicate that it failed without raising an exception.  (If the only way your methods fail is by raising an exception, that simplifies the protocol.  If you're having to deal with a lot of non-exception failure states outside of the method that failed, you probably have a design problem that you haven't worked out yet.)</p>

<p>The downside of this approach is that all of the methods have to use the same arguments.  I've opted for none, with the expectation that the methods I've stubbed out will end up manipulating class members.</p>

<p>The upside of this approach is considerable, though.  First, you can add dozens of methods to the process without <code>send_message</code> getting any more complex.  </p>

<p>You can also go crazy and do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>def handle_exception(self, method, exception):
    custom_handler_name = "handle_{0}_in_{1}".format(\
                                             exception.__class__.__name__,
                                             method.__name__)
    try:
        custom_handler = self.__dict__[custom_handler_name]
    except KeyError:
        print "{name} ({msg}) in {method}.".format(
           name=exception.__class__.__name__, 
           msg=exception,
           method=method.__name__)
        return
    custom_handler()

def handle_AuthenticationError_in_authenticate(self):
   print "Your login credentials are questionable."
</code></pre>

<p>...though at that point, I might say to myself, "self, you're working the Command pattern pretty hard without creating a Command class.  Maybe now is the time."</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Why not one big try: block? This way, if any exception is caught, you'll go all the way to the except. And as long as all the exceptions for the different steps are different, you can always tell which part it was that fired the exception.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I like David's answer but if you are stuck on the server exceptions you can also check for server if is None or states.  I flattened out the method a bit bit it is still a but unpythonic looking but more readable in the logic at the bottom.</p>

<pre><code>server = None 

def server_obtained(host):
    try:

        return False
