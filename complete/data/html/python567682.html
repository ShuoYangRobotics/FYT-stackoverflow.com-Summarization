<h3>Question (ID-567682):</h3><h2>Online compilers/runtime for Java, C++, Python and ObjC?</h2><p>Does anyone know of a good online compiler/runtime (for C++, Java, Python, ObjC etc.) that I can access on the web? </p>

<p>What I'm looking for is something that would allow me to type in a program in a web form and to run the program and see the results online.</p>

<p>(Let's not get into the why for now. Suffice it to say for the moment that I don't always have access to a compiler/runtime, and firing up an IDE is just overkill for testing out some code snippets)</p>

<p>I know of codepad.org -- but I'm looking for something better. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>codepad.org is an online
  compiler/interpreter, and a simple
  collaboration tool. Paste your code
  below, and codepad will run it and
  give you a short URL you can use to
  share it in chat or email.</p>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p><a href="http://tryruby.hobix.com/" rel="nofollow">This one</a> is good for ruby.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>For C++, you could try <a href="http://www.codecontrol.blogspot.com/2007/08/online-c-c-compiler.html" rel="nofollow">CodeControl</a>, <a href="http://www.comeaucomputing.com/tryitout/" rel="nofollow">Comeau</a> or the one from <a href="http://code.vcer.net/" rel="nofollow">code.vcer.net</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Here is an open source one: <a href="http://codenode.org" rel="nofollow">http://codenode.org</a>, which supports Python and Sage well, but also aims to support other languages like Ruby, R, etc.  Probably the best description of Codenode is "Google docs combined with Mathematica Notebooks".</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Right now, you can use <a href="http://sagenb.org" rel="nofollow">http://sagenb.org</a>.  This is a free open source online Google Docs-like programming notebook environment, which I provide (thanks to a generous grant from the National Science Foundation).  Once you create an account and create a new worksheet, click on the box (fourth from left) labeled "Sage" and change it to Python.  Now all the code you type in is evaluated using Python.   The main drawback is that there are well over 30,000 users of this resource, so sometimes it is slow. </p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>I found this online java compiler and runner. It works in realtime and also with threads. Amazing !
