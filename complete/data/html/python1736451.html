<h3>Question (ID-1736451):</h3><h2>Native Python Editor for Mac?</h2><p>I'm currently using IDLE, its decent, but I'd like to know if there're better lightweight IDEs built especially for Mac — free or commercial. </p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-10):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p><a href="http://macromates.com/" rel="nofollow">TextMate</a> is a great general-purpose editor for mac. Used by the Rails community a lot, but it's great with python too.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Allow me to suggest the GUI version of <a href="http://www.vim.org/" rel="nofollow">Vim</a> for Mac OS X, aptly named <a href="http://code.google.com/p/macvim/" rel="nofollow">MacVim</a>.  It is superb.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Purpose built for Mac? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xcode" rel="nofollow">Xcode</a> supports python. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textmate" rel="nofollow">Textmate</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBedit" rel="nofollow">BBEdit</a> are also great editors.</p>

<p>If you're fine with generic multiplatform IDE's, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komodo%5FEdit#Komodo%5FEdit" rel="nofollow">Komodo Edit</a> is great.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>There is a commercial one - Textmate.
Most of the good free editors are cross-platform (if you are ok with it, I'd recommend EditRa - but it doesn't work properly under 10.6 yet, because of some bugs in wxPython).</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>There're aren't any Mac-specific Python IDEs, though <a href="http://www.activestate.com/komodo/" rel="nofollow">Komodo's</a> IDE, <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/features/python/index.html" rel="nofollow">NetBeans</a> and Eclipse (with the excellent <a href="http://pydev.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">PyDev</a> extensions) all have very good Python IDE functionality and run fine on OS X. I've never used <a href="http://www.wingware.com/" rel="nofollow">Wing</a> IDE on OS X, but it has a pretty loyal following as well. If you just need an editor (I find that a good editor and a command line are often sufficient for Python), <a href="http://macromates.com/" rel="nofollow">TextMate</a> along with <a href="http://ipython.scipy.org" rel="nofollow">IPython</a> in a terminal is the way to go. When I really do need a full IDE, I've been very happy with Eclipse/PyDev.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>vim, emacs, BBEdit, WingIDE, or my favorite - eclipse (although, I don't think this is very lightweight)</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I would recommend you to look at <strong>Aptana</strong>(it's more attractive then Eclipse for me)<strong>+PyDev</strong> or <strong>PyCarm</strong>. I use <strong>TextMate</strong> too, but those are easy for debug.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>I use <strong>FRAISE</strong> (free) it is <em>simple</em> and useful, auto indentation, colorize, auto completion, shell.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>going to vote for Fraise. handles almost anything, has indentations, and uses color! its free too.</p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>check out Sublime Text 2 Alpha. seriously awesome.</p>
