<h3>Question (ID-5736294):</h3><h2>De-greedifying a regular expression in python</h2><p>I'm trying to write a regular expression that will convert a full path filename to a short filename for a given filetype, minus the file extension.</p>

<p>For example, I'm trying to get just the name of the .bar file from a string using</p>

<pre><code>re.search('/(.*?)\.bar$', '/def_params/param_1M56/param/foo.bar')
</code></pre>

<p>According to the Python re docs, <code>*?</code> is the ungreedy version of <code>*</code>, so I was expecting to get</p>

<pre><code>'foo'
</code></pre>

<p>returned for <code>match.group(1)</code> but instead I got </p>

<pre><code>'def_params/param_1M56/param/foo'
</code></pre>

<p>What am I missing here about greediness?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>What you're missing isn't so much about greediness as about regular expression engines:  they work from left to right, so the <code>/</code> matches as early as possible and the <code>.*?</code> is then forced to work from there.  In this case, the best regex doesn't involve greediness at all (you need backtracking for that to work; it will, but could take a really long time to run if there are a lot of slashes), but a more explicit pattern:</p>

<pre><code>'/([^/]*)\.bar$'
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I would suggest changing your regex so that it doesn't rely on greedyness.</p>

<p>You want only the filename before the extension <code>.bar</code> and everything after the final <code>/</code>. This should do:</p>

<pre><code>re.search(`/[^/]*\.bar$`, '/def_params/param_1M56/param/foo.bar')
</code></pre>

<p>What this does is it matches <code>/</code>, then zero or more characters (as much as possible) that are <strong>not</strong> <code>/</code> and then <code>.bar</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I don't claim to understand the non-greedy operators all that well, but a solution for that particular problem would be to use ([^/]*?)</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The regular expressions starts from the right. Put a .* at the start and it should work.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I like regex but there is no need of one here.</p>

<pre><code>path = '/def_params/param_1M56/param/foo.bar'
print  path.rsplit('/',1)[1].rsplit('.')[0]

path = '/def_params/param_1M56/param/fululu'
print  path.rsplit('/',1)[1].rsplit('.')[0]

path = '/def_params/param_1M56/param/one.before.two.dat'
print  path.rsplit('/',1)[1].rsplit('.',1)[0]
</code></pre>

<p>result</p>

<pre><code>foo
fululu
one.before.two
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Other people have answered the regex question, but in this case there's a more efficient way than regex:</p>

<pre><code>file_name = path[path.rindex('/')+1 : path.rindex('.')]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>try this one on for size:</p>

<p>match = re.search('.*/(.*?).bar$', '/def_params/param_1M56/param/foo.bar')</p>
