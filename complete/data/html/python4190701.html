<h3>Question (ID-4190701):</h3><h2>How to fix a Python elif?</h2><p>Okay I have the below code performing something I don't want it to do. If you run the program it will ask you "How are you?" (obviously), but when you give a answer to the question that applies to the elif statement, I still get a if statement response. Why is this?</p>

<pre><code>talk = raw_input("How are you?")
if "good" or "fine" in talk:
     print "Glad to here it..."
elif "bad" or "sad" or "terrible" in talk:
     print "I'm sorry to hear that!"
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The problem is that the <code>or</code> operator does not do what you want here. What you're really saying is <code>if the value of "good" is True or "fine" is in talk</code>. The value of "good" is always True, since it's a non-empty string, which is why that branch always gets executed.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><code>if "good" in talk or "fine" in talk</code> is what you meant. What you wrote is equivalent to <code>if "good" or ("fine" in talk)</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><pre><code>talk = raw_input("How are you?")
if any(x in talk for x in ("good", "fine")):
     print "Glad to here it..."
elif any(x in talk for x in ("bad", "sad", "terrible")):
     print "I'm sorry to hear that!"
</code></pre>

<p>Note:</p>

<pre><code>In [46]: "good" or "fine" in "I'm feeling blue"
Out[46]: 'good'
</code></pre>

<p>Python is grouping the condition like this:</p>

<pre><code>("good") or ("fine" in "I'm feeling blue")
</code></pre>

<p>In terms of boolean values, that's equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>True or False
</code></pre>

<p>which is equal to </p>

<pre><code>True
</code></pre>

<p>That's why the if-block is always getting executed.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Use a regular expression. What if the input is "I'm good. Well, i'm more fine. Sorry, i feel terrible, my bad."
Then you'll have all conditions fulfilled and the output won't be what you expect.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You have to test each string separately, or test for inclusion in a list or tuple.</p>

<p>In your code, Python will take the value of your strings and test them for truth (<code>"good"',</code>"bad"' and <code>"sad"' will return</code>True' as they're not empty), and then it will check if `"fine"' is in the characters of talk (because of the way the in operator works with strings).</p>

<p>You should do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>talk = raw_input("How are you?")
if talk in ("good", "fine"):
     print "Glad to here it..."
elif talk in ("bad", "sad", "terrible"):
     print "I'm sorry to hear that!"
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>This worked for me: </p>

<pre><code>talk = raw_input("How are you? ")
words = re.split("\\s+", talk)
if 'fine' in words:
    print "Glad to hear it..."
elif 'terrible' in words:
    print "I'm sorry to hear that!"
else:
    print "Huh?"
</code></pre>

<p>From reading the other answers, we'd have to expand the predicates for other words.</p>
