<h3>Question (ID-8371524):</h3><h2>String with non-letters</h2><p>This is my second week of learning python and I got an homework assignment which I have already finished.
The thing is that one of the first stages was to take a string and delete all non letters from it (such as "," "." ";", spaces, etc..)
so I took the string and each time wrote:</p>

<pre><code>str1 = str.replace(',', '')
str2 = str.replace(' ', '') 
....
</code></pre>

<p>and so on like 5 times. my teacher says its fine for now. but it doesn't look good for me.
there must be a better way instead of duplicating the code.
Can someone explain a better way of doing that?</p>

<p>(I tought about using an ascii function in a condition but couldn't figure it out)</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You could use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/re.html" rel="nofollow"><code>re</code> module</a> like this:</p>

<pre><code>import re
str = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z]+', '', str)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Of course! You can use a loop:</p>

<pre><code>toBeReplaced = [',',' ', ... some more chars ...]
for c in toBeReplaced:
    yourString = yourString.replace(c,'')
</code></pre>

<p>You might also have a look at regular expressions, which would make your job simpler and more stable. But that's probably not what your teacher want's to see.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>It's easier to find <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/string.html#string.letters" rel="nofollow">letters</a> than non-letters:</p>

<pre><code>import string

def clean_string(input_string):
    result = ""
    for char in input_string:
        if char in string.letters: # string.letters contains a...zA...Z
            result += char
    return result
</code></pre>

<p>There are also fancier ways of doing this:</p>

<pre><code>def clean_string2(input_string):
    return "".join([char for char in input_string if char in string.letters])
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I will not give you any code as this is a homework assignment, and it'll be better for you if you try coding it yourself. But I'll try to give you some hints to nudge you in the right direction.</p>

<p>As a homework assignment, your teacher expects you to write code that is extensible and manageable. When you duplicate code, it loses both those properties. </p>

<p>For this assignment, the first thing you'd want to do is carefully look at the requirements. There are <em>too many</em> non-alpha characters, so instead of removing each of them, you can consider only <em>including</em> the alpha characters. This can be done using a <code>for</code> loop.</p>

<p>Once you learn more advanced techniques, you can start researching regex patterns, and using those. In python, those can be found in the <code>re</code> module.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>one line with out regular expressions and without imports:</p>

<pre><code>''.join( [ x for x in str if x.isalpha() ] )
</code></pre>

<p>sample:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; ''.join( [ x for x in 'pepito;.:123jdjd' if x.isalpha() ] )
'pepitojdjd'
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s = 'pepito;.:123jdjd'
&gt;&gt;&gt; import string
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.translate(string.maketrans('',''), string.punctuation)
'pepito123jdjd'
</code></pre>
