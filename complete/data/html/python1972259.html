<h3>Question (ID-1972259):</h3><h2>mysql-python install problem using virtualenv, windows, pip</h2><p>I'm trying to install mysql-python in a virtualenv using pip on windows.  At first, I was getting the same error <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1706989/setting-up-virtualenv-for-django-development-on-windows">reported here</a>, but the answer there worked for me too.  Now I'm getting this following error:</p>

<p><code>_mysql.c(34) : Fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'config-win.h': No such file or directory</code></p>

<p><em>edit</em>:
If I symlink (Win7) to my regular (not the virtualenv's) python's site-packages/MySQLdb dir I get <code>Error loading MySQLdb module: No module named _mysql</code>.</p>

<p>I'm rather at a loss here.  Any pointers?</p>

<p>In 5.5 config-win. has actually moved to Connector separate folder in windows. i.e. smth like:</p>

<p>C:\Program Files\MySQL\Connector C 6.0.2\include</p>

<p>To overcome the problem one need not only to download "dev bits" (which actually connects the <em>connector</em>) but also to modify mysqldb install scripts to add the include folder. I've done a quick dirty fix as that. </p>

<p>site.cfg:</p>

<pre><code># Windows connector libs for MySQL.
connector = C:\Program Files\MySQL\Connector C 6.0.2
</code></pre>

<p>in setup_windows.py locate the line </p>

<pre><code>include_dirs = [ os.path.join(mysql_root, r'include') ]:
</code></pre>

<p>and add:</p>

<pre><code>include_dirs = [ os.path.join(options['connector'], r'include') ]
</code></pre>

<p>after it.</p>

<p>Ugly but works until mysqldb authors will change the behaviour.</p>

<hr>

<p>Almost forgot to mention. In the same manner one needs to add similar additional entry for libs:</p>

<pre><code>library_dirs = [ os.path.join(options['connector'], r'lib\opt') ]
</code></pre>

<p>i.e. your setup_windows.py looks pretty much like:</p>

<pre><code>...
library_dirs = [ os.path.join(mysql_root, r'lib\opt') ]
library_dirs = [ os.path.join(options['connector'], r'lib\opt') ]
libraries = [ 'kernel32', 'advapi32', 'wsock32', client ]
include_dirs = [ os.path.join(mysql_root, r'include') ]
include_dirs = [ os.path.join(options['connector'], r'include') ]
extra_compile_args = [ '/Zl' ]
...
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Installing dev bits for mysql got rid of the <code>config-win.h</code> error I was having, and threw another. <code>Failed to load and parse the manifest. The system cannot find the file specified.</code> I found the answer to my problem in this post: <a href="http://www.fuyun.org/2009/12/install-mysql-for-python-on-windows/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fuyun.org/2009/12/install-mysql-for-python-on-windows/</a>.</p>

<p>I copied the file 'C:\Python26\Lib\distutils\msvc9compiler.py` into my virtualenv, made the edit suggested in the above link, and things are working fine.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Most probably the answer is to install MySQL Developer Build and selecting "C headers\libs" option during configuration. (as reported in this entry: Building MySQLdb for Python on Windows on rationalpie.wordpress.com)</p>

<p>Maybe even better solution is to install a precompiled build: <a href="http://www.technicalbard.com/files/MySQL-python-1.2.2.win32-py2.6.exe" rel="nofollow">http://www.technicalbard.com/files/MySQL-python-1.2.2.win32-py2.6.exe</a></p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Well, if you are still having the problem, you can download the installer from <a href="http://code.google.com/p/soemin/downloads/detail?name=MySQL-python-1.2.3.win32-py2.7.exe" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/soemin/downloads/detail?name=MySQL-python-1.2.3.win32-py2.7.exe</a></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Try <a href="http://code.activestate.com/pypm/mysql-python/" rel="nofollow">ActivePython</a>,</p>

<pre><code>pypm -E C:\myvirtualenv install mysql-python
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>No need to configure and build anything manually.
Just download <a href="http://soemin.googlecode.com/files/MySQL-python-1.2.3.win32-py2.7.exe" rel="nofollow">this</a> and install.
Everything works well in Python2.7 for MySql 5.5</p>
