<h3>Question (ID-8582741):</h3><h2>Why do Python's math.ceil() and math.floor() operations return floats instead of integers?</h2><p>Can someone explain this (straight from the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/math.html#number-theoretic-and-representation-functions">docs</a>- emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>math.ceil(x)</strong> Return the ceiling of x <em>as a float</em>, the smallest <em>integer</em> value greater than or equal to x.</p>
  
  <p><strong>math.floor(x)</strong> Return the floor of x <em>as a float</em>, the largest <em>integer</em> value less than or equal to x.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why would <code>.ceil</code> and <code>.floor</code> return floats when they are by definition supposed to calculate integers?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>Well this got some very good arguments as to why they <em>should</em> return floats, and I was just getting used to the idea, when <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/8582845/165673">@jcollado</a> pointed out that they in fact <em>do</em> return ints in Python 3...</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>As pointed out by other answers, in python they return floats probably because of historical reasons to prevent overflow problems. However, they return integers in python 3.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import math
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(math.floor(3.1))
&lt;class 'int'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(math.ceil(3.1))
&lt;class 'int'&gt;
</code></pre>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The range of floating point numbers usually exceeds the range of integers. By returning a floating point value, the functions can return a sensible value for input values that lie outside the representable range of integers.</p>

<p>Consider: If <code>floor()</code> returned an integer, what should <code>floor(1.0e30)</code> return?</p>

<p>Now, while Python's integers are now arbitrary precision, it wasn't always this way. The standard library functions are thin wrappers around the equivalent C library functions.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Because python's math library is a thin wrapper around the C math library which returns floats.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Because the range for floats is greater than that of integers -- returning an integer could overflow</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Before Python 2.4, an integer couldn't hold the full range of truncated real numbers.</p>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>The source of your confusion is evident in your comment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>the whole point of ceil/floor operations is to convert floats to integers!</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>The point of the ceil and floor operations is to round floating-point data to <em>integral values</em>.  Not to do a type conversion.  Users who need to get <em>integer</em> values can do an explicit conversion following the operation.</p>

<p>Note that it would not be possible to implement a round to integral value as trivially if all you had available were a ceil or float operation that returned an integer.  You would need to first check that the input is within the representable integer range, then call the function; you would need to handle NaN and infinities in a separate code path.</p>

<p>Additionally, you must have versions of ceil and floor which return floating-point numbers if you want to conform to IEEE-754.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Maybe because other languages do this as well, so it is generally-accepted behavior. (For good reasons, as shown in the other answers)</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>There is really no sane way to make such a function that returns a standard integer type. Clearly the input has to be a float. And the range of floats vastly exceeds the range of integers. So <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009604499/functions/ceil.html" rel="nofollow">returning a float is the standard</a>.</p>
