<h3>Question (ID-1456617):</h3><h2>Return a random word from a word list in python</h2><p>I would like to retrieve a random word from a file using python, but I do not believe my following method is best or efficient. Please assist.</p>

<pre><code>import fileinput
import _random
file = [line for line in fileinput.input("/etc/dictionaries-common/words")]
rand = _random.Random()
print file[int(rand.random() * len(file))],
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-9):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The random module defines choice(), which does what you want:</p>

<pre><code>import random

words = [line.strip() for line in open('/etc/dictionaries-common/words')]
print random.choice(words)
</code></pre>

<p>Note also that this assumes that each word is by itself on a line in the file. If the file is very big, or if you perform this operation frequently, you may find that constantly rereading the file impacts your application's performance negatively.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Another solution is to use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/linecache.html#linecache.getline" rel="nofollow">getline</a></p>

<pre><code>import linecache
import random
line_number = random.randint(0, total_num_lines)
linecache.getline('/etc/dictionaries-common/words', line_number)
</code></pre>

<p>From the documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The linecache module allows one to get
  any line from any file, while
  attempting to optimize internally,
  using a cache, the common case where
  many lines are read from a single file</p>
</blockquote>

<p>EDIT:
You can calculate the total number once and store it, since the dictionary file is unlikely to change.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import random
&gt;&gt;&gt; random.choice(list(open('/etc/dictionaries-common/words')))
'jaundiced\n'
</code></pre>

<p>It is efficient human-time-wise.  </p>

<p>btw, your implementation coincides with the one from stdlib's <a href="http://svn.python.org/view/python/trunk/Lib/random.py?view=markup" rel="nofollow"><code>random.py</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code> def choice(self, seq):
    """Choose a random element from a non-empty sequence."""
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]
</code></pre>

<h3>Measure time performance</h3>

<p>I was wondering what is the relative performance of the presented solutions. <code>linecache</code>-based is the obvious favorite. How much slower is the <code>random.choice</code>'s one-liner compared to honest algorithm implemented in <code>select_random_line()</code>?</p>

<pre><code># nadia_known_num_lines   9.6e-06 seconds 1.00
# nadia                   0.056 seconds 5843.51
# jfs                     0.062 seconds 1.10
# dcrosta_no_strip        0.091 seconds 1.48
# dcrosta                 0.13 seconds 1.41
# mark_ransom_no_strip    0.66 seconds 5.10
# mark_ransom_choose_from 0.67 seconds 1.02
# mark_ransom             0.69 seconds 1.04
</code></pre>

<p>(Each function is called 10 times (cached performance)).</p>

<p>These result show that simple solution (<code>dcrosta</code>) is faster in this case than a more deliberate one (<code>mark_ransom</code>).</p>

<pre><code>import random

<p>Edit: the original version of my answer used <code>readlines</code>, which didn't work as I thought and was totally unnecessary. This version will iterate through the file instead of reading it all into memory, and do it in a single pass, which should make it much more efficient than any answer I've seen thus far.</p>

<h3>Generalized version</h3>

<pre><code>import random

def choose_from(iterable):
    """Choose a random element from a finite `iterable`.

    If `iterable` is a sequence then use `random.choice()` for efficiency.

    Return tuple (random element, total number of elements)
    """
    selection, i = None, None
    for i, item in enumerate(iterable):
        if random.randint(0, i) == 0:
            selection = item

    return selection, (i+1 if i is not None else 0)
</code></pre>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code>print choose_from(open("/etc/dictionaries-common/words"))
print choose_from(dict(a=1, b=2))
print choose_from(i for i in range(10) if i % 3 == 0)
print choose_from(i for i in range(10) if i % 11 == 0 and i) # empty
print choose_from([0]) # one element
chunk, n = choose_from(urllib2.urlopen("http://google.com"))
print (chunk[:20], n)
</code></pre>

<h3>Output</h3>

<pre>
('yeps\n', 98569)
('a', 2)
(6, 4)
(None, 0)
(0, 1)
('window._gjp && _gjp(', 10)
</pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You could do this without using <code>fileinput</code>:</p>

<pre><code>import random
data = open("/etc/dictionaries-common/words").readlines()
print random.choice(data)
</code></pre>

<p>I have also used <code>data</code> instead of <code>file</code> because <code>file</code> is a predefined type in Python.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I don't have code for you but as far as an algorithm goes:</p>

<ol>
<li>Find the file's size</li>
<li>Do a random seek with the seek() function</li>
<li>Find the next (or previous) whitespace character</li>
<li>Return the word that starts after that whitespace character</li>
</ol>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Efficiency and verbosity aren't the same thing in this case. It's tempting to go for the most beautiful, pythonic approach that does everything in one or two lines but for file I/O, stick with classic fopen-style, low-level interaction, even if it does take up a few more lines of code.</p>

<p>I could copy and paste some code and claim it to be my own (others can if they want) but have a look at this: <a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/tutor/2007-July/055635.html" rel="nofollow">http://mail.python.org/pipermail/tutor/2007-July/055635.html</a></p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>There are a few different ways to optimize this problem. You can optimize for speed, or for space.</p>

<p>If you want a quick but memory-hungry solution, read in the entire file using file.readlines() and then use random.choice()</p>

<p>If you want a memory-efficient solution, first check the number of lines in the file by calling somefile.readline() repeatedly until it returns "", then generate a random number smaller then the number of lines (say, n), seek back to the beginning of the file, and finally call somefile.readline() n times. The next call to somefile.readline() will return the desired random line. This approach wastes no memory holding "unnecessary" lines. Of course, if you plan on getting lots of random lines from the file, this will be horribly inefficient, and it's better to just keep the entire file in memory, like in the first approach.</p>
