<h3>Question (ID-1613042):</h3><h2>Parsing XML - right scripting languages / packages for the job?</h2><p>I know that any language is capable of parsing XML; I'm really just looking for advantages or drawbacks that you may have come across in your own experiences.  Perl would be my standard go to here, but I'm open to suggestions.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>UPDATE: I ended up going with XML::Simple which did a nice job, but I have one piece of advice if you plan to use it--research the forcearray option first.  I had to rewrite a bunch of statements after learning that it is <em>usually</em> best practice to set forcearray.  <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~grantm/XML-Simple-2.18/lib/XML/Simple/FAQ.pod#What%5Fis%5Fthe%5Fforcearray%5Foption%5Fall%5Fabout?" rel="nofollow">This</a> page had the clearest explanation that I could find. Frankly, I'm surprised this isn't the default behavior.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>If you are using Perl then I would recommend <a href="http://articles.techrepublic.com.com/5100-10878%5F11-5363190.html" rel="nofollow">XML::Simple</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As more and more Web sites begin using
  XML for their content, it's
  increasingly important for Web
  developers to know how to parse XML
  data and convert it into different
  formats. That's where the Perl module
  called XML::Simple comes in. It takes
  away the drudgery of parsing XML data,
  making the process easier than you
  ever thought possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>For pure XML parsing, I wouldn't use Java, C#, C++, C, etc. They tend to overcomplicate things, as in you want a banana and get the gorilla with it as well.</p>

<p>Higher-level and interpreted languages such as Perl, PHP, Python, Groovy are more suitable. Perl is included in virtually every Linux distro, as is PHP for the most part.</p>

<p>I've used Groovy recently for especially this and found it very easy. Mind you though that a C parser will be orders of magnitude faster than Groovy for instance.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>It's all going to be in the libraries.</p>

<p>Python has great libraries for XML. My preference is <a href="http://codespeak.net/lxml/" rel="nofollow">lxml</a>. It uses libxml/libxslt so it's fast, but the Python binding make it really easy to use. Perl may very well have equally awesome OO libraries.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I saw that people recommend XML::Simple if you decide on Perl.</p>

<p>While XML::Simple is, indeed, very simple to use and great, is a DOM parser. As such, it is, sadly, completely unsuitable to processing large XML files as your process would run out of memory (it's a common problem for <strong>any DOM parser</strong>, not limited to XML::Simple or Perl).</p>

<p>So, for large files, you must pick a SAX parser in whichever language you choose (there are many XML SAX parsers in Perl, or use another stream parser like XML::Twig that is even better than standard SAX parser. Can't speak for other languages).</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Not exactly a scripting language, but you could also consider <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/node/131" rel="nofollow">Scala</a>. You can start from <a href="http://metacircular.wordpress.com/2007/02/04/scala-makes-xml-processing-easy/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>It's not a scripting language, but Scala is great for <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/node/131" rel="nofollow">working with XML natively</a>. Also, see this <a href="http://burak.emir.googlepages.com/scalaxbook.docbk.html" rel="nofollow">book (draft) by Burak</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Scala's XML support is rather good, especially as XML can just be typed directly into Scala programs.</p>

<p>Microsoft also did some cool integrated stuff with their <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb308960.aspx" rel="nofollow">LINQ for XML</a></p>

<p>But I really like <a href="http://effbot.org/zone/element-index.htm" rel="nofollow">Elementtree</a> and just that package alone is a good reason to use Python instead of Perl ;) </p>

<p>Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>import elementtree.ElementTree as ET

# build a tree structure
root = ET.Element("html")

head = ET.SubElement(root, "head")

title = ET.SubElement(head, "title")
title.text = "Page Title"

body = ET.SubElement(root, "body")
body.set("bgcolor", "#ffffff")

body.text = "Hello, World!"

# wrap it in an ElementTree instance, and save as XML
tree = ET.ElementTree(root)
tree.write("page.xhtml")
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>Python has some pretty good support for XML. From the standard library DOM packages to much more 'pythonic' libraries that parse XML directly into more usable object structures.</p>

<p>There isn't really a 'right' language though... there are good XML packages for most languages nowadays.</p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>If you're going to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby%5F%28programming%5Flanguage%29" rel="nofollow">Ruby</a> to do it then you're going to want to take a look at <a href="http://nokogiri.org/" rel="nofollow">Nokogiri</a> or <a href="http://garrickvanburen.com/archive/parsing-arbitrary-xml-namespaces-in-ruby-with-hpricot" rel="nofollow">Hpricot</a>.  Both have their strengths and weaknesses.  The language and package selection really comes down to what you want to do with the data after you've parsed it.</p>
<br /><b>#10</b><br /><p>Reading Data out of XML files is dead easy with C# and LINQ to XML!</p>

<p>Somehow, although I really love python, I found it hard to parse XML with the standard libraries.</p>
<br /><b>#11</b><br /><p>I would say it depends like everything else.  VB.NET 2008 uses XML literals, has IntelliSense for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language%5FIntegrated%5FQuery#LINQ%5Fto%5FXML" rel="nofollow">LINQ to XML</a>, and a few power toys that help turn XML into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML%5FSchema%5F%28W3C%29" rel="nofollow">XSD</a>.  So personally, if you are working in a .NET environment I think this is the best choice. </p>
