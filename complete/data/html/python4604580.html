<h3>Question (ID-4604580):</h3><h2>Twisted server for multiple clients</h2><p>I want to write a server that can accept multiple clients in python (twisted). I am already quite familiar with socket programming with the standard python socket module but here comes the trouble..
I think twisted is really hard to get into and i have read some tutorials about it. 
But a thing that i can't really find is a simple socket server that accepts multiple connections.. Can anyone help? If i missed some valuable information online please let me know because i am pulling my hair out.. </p>

<p>Any help is much appreciated,</p>

I would suggested the following tutorials in order and then read the twisted documentation. Write small snippets as its given in these tutorials to understand what is actually happening. </p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Say, you want to run a server accepting client connections on port 9000:</p>

<pre><code>from twisted.internet import reactor, protocol

PORT = 9000

class MyServer(protocol.Protocol):
    pass

class MyServerFactory(protocol.Factory):
    protocol = MyServer

factory = MyServerFactory()
reactor.listenTCP(PORT, factory)
reactor.run()
</code></pre>

<p>And if you want to test connecting to this server, here's the code for a client (to launch in a different terminal):</p>

<pre><code>from twisted.internet import reactor, protocol

HOST = 'localhost'
PORT = 9000

class MyClient(protocol.Protocol):
    def connectionMade(self):
        print "connected!"

class MyClientFactory(protocol.ClientFactory):
    protocol = MyClient

factory = MyClientFactory()
reactor.connectTCP(HOST, PORT, factory)

reactor.run()
</code></pre>

<p>You'll notice the code is very similar, only we use a Factory for a server and a ClientFactory for a client, and the servers needs to listen (listenTCP) while the client needs to connect (connectTCP). Good luck!</p>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Twisted is an awesome framework, but this (as often) implies that for easy thing it may be a quite hard...</p>

<p>Here's the fact. You need to write a class that implements a <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/8.2.0/api/twisted.internet.protocol.ClientFactory.html" rel="nofollow">Resource</a>, a LineReceiver if you need, and then attach it to the reactor with:</p>

<pre><code>reactor.connectTCP(&lt;HOST&gt;, &lt;PORT&gt;, istance_of_your_class)
</code></pre>
