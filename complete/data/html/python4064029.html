<h3>Question (ID-4064029):</h3><h2>Is there such a thing for Django as there is Heroku for Ruby on Rails</h2><p>Is there a cloud based development for Django, such as there is cloud based development and hosting environment for Ruby / <a href="http://heroku.com/" rel="nofollow">heroku</a></p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-10):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p><strong><a href="http://www.ep.io/">ep.io</a></strong> provides WSGI hosting Heroku style.  It's from <a href="http://www.aeracode.org/">Andrew Godwin</a> of <a href="http://south.aeracode.org/">South</a> fame.  From their website:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is ep.io, the hosted WSGI hosting and deployment solution. We take your Django, Flask, Pylons or other WSGI code, run all the annoying hosting parts for you, and make sure everything's redundant and backed up.  In return, we bill you only for the processing time and bandwidth you actually use - we'll even give you detailed analytics of when and where those resources are being used. However, we're currently in a closed beta, so this is only available to those we invite</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They support PostgreSQL and Redis. They have a client you download to deploy from the command line, or you can push to them via git or mercurial.  They have a good amount of documentation, but I just recently started using them and haven't pushed a deployment yet so I have no idea of how well the service works yet.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://gondor.io/">Gondor</a></strong> is from the <a href="http://eldarion.com/">Eldarion</a> guys (founder of the company is also founder of <a href="http://pinaxproject.com/">pinax</a>).  They support:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <ul>
    <li>revision control via git or mercurial</li>
    <li>dependency management using pip</li>
    <li>database migrations via South or nashvegas</li>
    <li>full backups of your entire application</li>
    <li>asynchronous and scheduled task execution </li>
    <li>full-text search using Solr and django-haystack</li>
    <li>caching via memcached or redis</li>
    </ul>

<p>From the survey they have you take when you get a beta account, it seems like they're looking to host massive traffic sites.  The survey actually made me wonder how expensive the service is going to be after beta.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Heroku itself is now for Django, too! Sort of. :) Heroku now implicitly supports Django with its new Cedar "run anything" release. See:</p>

<p><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2612943">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2612943</a> and

<p>Its not automated like Rails and Node.js would be, so you'll have to be pretty smart with your configuration skills. But you if you can follow this:</p>

<p>it should get you there and beyond.</p>

<p>Update:</p>

<p>Heroku is starting to document its support for python &amp; django.See:</p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><a href="https://www.djangy.com/" rel="nofollow">Djangy</a> seems to be similar. I used neither, so I can't say how similar they are. Djangy only supports MySQL as a database, which is kind of a deal breaker for me.</p>

<p>/edit: as Zolomon says, Djangy closed its doors. I'll recommend <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4064029/is-there-such-a-thing-for-django-as-there-is-heroku-for-ruby-on-rails/5125546#5125546">RJBrady</a>'s answer for some serious upvoting.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>google app engine might do what you want - take a look at it here <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/articles/django.html" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/appengine/articles/django.html</a></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I just found out about <a href="http://www.dotcloud.com/" rel="nofollow">DotCloud.com</a>! Seems like they will support a customizable stack!</p>
