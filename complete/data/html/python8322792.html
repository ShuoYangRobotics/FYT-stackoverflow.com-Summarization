<h3>Question (ID-8322792):</h3><h2>Adding a string to a list</h2><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; b = []
&gt;&gt;&gt; c = '1234'
&gt;&gt;&gt; b += c
&gt;&gt;&gt; b
['1', '2', '3', '4']
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>What is happening here ? This should not work, right ? or am I missing something obvious?</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; b = []
&gt;&gt;&gt; c = '1234'
&gt;&gt;&gt; b + c
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;pyshell#7&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    b + c
TypeError: can only concatenate list (not "str") to list
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>Then <code>a += b</code>  is not always equivalent to <code>a = a + b</code> ?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Strings are iterable: the elements are the string's characters. When you add an iterable to a list, the iterable's <em>elements</em> get appended to the list.</p>

<p>Either of the following will do what you're expecting (i.e. append the string, not extend the list with the string's characters):</p>

<pre><code>b += [c]
</code></pre>

<p>or </p>

<pre><code>b.append(c)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The <code>+=</code> operator <em>extends</em> a list instead of appending to it:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; b = []
&gt;&gt;&gt; c = "1234"
&gt;&gt;&gt; b.append(c)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b
['1234']
&gt;&gt;&gt; b.extend(c)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b
['1234', '1', '2', '3', '4']
&gt;&gt;&gt; b += c
&gt;&gt;&gt; b
['1234', '1', '2', '3', '4', '1', '2', '3', '4']
&gt;&gt;&gt; b += [c]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b
['1234', '1', '2', '3', '4', '1', '2', '3', '4', '1234']

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>This is an answer not to the original question (which I think has been adequately answered), but to the numerous questions that have been asked in the comments about the semantics of augmented assignment (<code>+=</code> and similar operations).</p>

<p>In a nutshell: Augmented assignment works differently for mutable types than for immutable ones.</p>

<p><code>str</code>, <code>tuple</code>, and the numeric types, among others, are immutable. The contents of a tuple cannot be changed once it has been created, so you get this behavior:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = (1, 2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = a
&gt;&gt;&gt; a += (3, 4)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
(1, 2, 3, 4)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b
(1, 2)
</code></pre>

<p><code>str</code> has the same semantics. Basically, <code>a += b</code> is equivalent to <code>a = a + b</code> if <code>a</code> is immutable.</p>

<p>Most other types, including <code>list</code>, are mutable. A list's contents <em>can</em> be changed in place, and augmented assignment does exactly that. Hence:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1, 2]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = a
&gt;&gt;&gt; a += [3, 4]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
[1, 2, 3, 4]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b
[1, 2, 3, 4]
</code></pre>

<p>Whereas if the third line were replaced with <code>a = a + [3, 4]</code>, a new list would be created and <code>b</code> would be <code>[1, 2]</code>.</p>

<p>For a user-defined class, the semantics depend on how it was implemented, but this is how it's supposed to be done per PEP 203.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>A string is a sequence of characters.  The list operation <code>+=</code> takes any sequence and appends each of the sequence's elements to the list.</p>

<p>(Actually <code>+=</code> takes any iterable.)</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>+= is syntactic sugar for extend, but + is just list concatenation. If you extend, you'll iterate over the argument, which in this case is a string. But you can't concatenate a string to a list, hence + fails.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>What did you expect? If you want to add <strong>c</strong> as string you must to do:</p>

<pre><code>b.append(c)
</code></pre>

<p>Cheers!</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>In essence, the += operator on the list will retrieve c's iterator, which will yield the individual characters in order. If you intended to add the actual string to the list, yielding the result ['1234'], you can use b.append('1234') instead.</p>
