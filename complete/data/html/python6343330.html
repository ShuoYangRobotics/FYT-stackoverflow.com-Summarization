<h3>Question (ID-6343330):</h3><h2>Importing a long list of constants to a Python file</h2><p>In Python, is there an analogue of the <code>C</code> preprocessor statement such as?:</p>

<p><code>#define MY_CONSTANT 50</code></p>

<p>Also, I have a large list of constants I'd like to import to several classes. Is there an analogue of declaring the constants as a long sequence of statements like the above in a <code>.py</code> file and importing it to another <code>.py</code> file?</p>

<p>Edit.</p>

<p>The file <code>Constants.py</code> reads:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
# encoding: utf-8
"""
Constants.py
"""

MY_CONSTANT_ONE = 50
MY_CONSTANT_TWO = 51
</code></pre>

<p>And <code>myExample.py</code> reads:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
# encoding: utf-8
"""
myExample.py
"""

import sys
import os

import Constants

class myExample:
    def __init__(self):
        self.someValueOne = Constants.MY_CONSTANT_ONE + 1
        self.someValueTwo = Constants.MY_CONSTANT_TWO + 1

if __name__ == '__main__':
    x = MyClass()
</code></pre>

<p>Edit.</p>

<p>From the compiler,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NameError: "global name
  'MY_CONSTANT_ONE' is not defined"</p>

<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Python doesn't have a preprocessor, nor does it have constants in the sense that they can't be changed - you can always change (nearly, you can emulate constant object properties, but doing this for the sake of constant-ness is rarely done and not considered useful) everything. When defining a constant, we define a name that's upper-case-with-underscores and call it a day - "We're all consenting adults here", no sane man would change a constant. Unless of course he has very good reasons and knows exactly what he's doing, in which case you can't (and propably shouldn't) stop him either way.</p>

<p>But of course you can define a module-level name with a value and use it in another module. This isn't specific to constants or anything, read up on the module system.</p>

<pre><code># a.py
MY_CONSTANT = ...

# b.py
import a
print a.MY_CONSTANT
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Python isn't preprocessed. You can just do:</p>

<pre><code>MY_CONSTANT = 50
</code></pre>

<p>Importing them will work:</p>

<pre><code>import myconstants
print myconstants.MY_CONSTANT * 2
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Sure, you can put your constants into a separate module. For example:</p>

<p>const.py:</p>

<pre><code>A = 12
B = 'abc'
C = 1.2
</code></pre>

<p>main.py:</p>

<pre><code>import const

print const.A, const.B, const.C
</code></pre>

<p>Note that as declared above, <code>A</code>, <code>B</code> and <code>C</code> are variables, i.e. can be changed at run time. </p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>And ofcourse you can do:</p>

<pre><code># a.py
MY_CONSTANT = ...

# b.py
from a import *
print MY_CONSTANT
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>As an alternative to using the import approach described in several answers, have a look a the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/configparser.html#module-ConfigParser" rel="nofollow">configparser</a> module.</p>

<p>The ConfigParser class implements a basic configuration file parser language which provides a structure similar to what you would find on Microsoft Windows INI files. You can use this to write Python programs which can be customized by end users easily.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Try to look <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3824455/python-constants">Python Constants</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3711657/can-i-prevent-modifying-an-object-in-python">Can I prevent modifying an object in Python?</a></p>

<p>Another one useful link: <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/65207-constants-in-python/" rel="nofollow">http://code.activestate.com/recipes/65207-constants-in-python/</a> tells us about the following option:</p>

<pre><code>from copy import deepcopy

class const(object):

    def __setattr__(self, name, value):
        if self.__dict__.has_key(name):
            print 'NO WAY this is a const' # put here anything you want(throw exc and etc)
            return deepcopy(self.__dict__[name])
        self.__dict__[name] = value

    def __getattr__(self, name, value):
        if self.__dict__.has_key(name):
            return deepcopy(self.__dict__[name])

    def __delattr__(self, item):
        if self.__dict__.has_key(item):
            print 'NOOOOO' # throw exception if needed

CONST = const()
CONST.Constant1 = 111
CONST.Constant1 = 12
print a.Constant1 # 111
CONST.Constant2 = 'tst'
CONST.Constant2 = 'tst1'
print a.Constant2 # 'tst'
</code></pre>

<p>So you could create a class like this and then import it from you contants.py module. This will allow you to be sure that value would not be changed, deleted.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>If you really want constants, not just variables looking like constants, the standard way to do it is to use immutable dictionaries. Unfortunately it's not built-in yet, so you have to use third party recipes (like <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/414283/" rel="nofollow">this one</a> or <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/498072-implementing-an-immutable-dictionary/" rel="nofollow">that one</a>).</p>
