<h3>Question (ID-5704292):</h3><h2>"+=" causing syntax error in Python</h2><pre><code>n = 1
p = 4
print n += p
</code></pre>

<p>gives me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>File "p7.py", line 17</p>
  
  <p>print n += p</p>
  
  <p>SyntaxError: invalid syntax</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How can this problem be fixed?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p><code>n += p</code> is a statement in Python, not an expression that returns a value you could print. This is different from a couple of other languages, for example Ruby, where <em>everything</em> is an expression.</p>

<p>You need to do</p>

<pre><code>n += p
print n
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You'll need to break it up onto separate lines:</p>

<pre><code>n = 1
p = 4
n += p
print n
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Assignment, including "augmented" assignment (<code>x op= expr</code> as shorcut for <code>x = x op expr</code>), is a statement, not an expression. So it doesn't result in a value. You can't print the result of something that doesn't result in anything - but that's what you're telling Python to do: "Evaluate <code>n += p</code>, then print the result of that."</p>

<p>If you want to modify <code>n</code> and print the new <code>n</code>, do that on two lines. If you just want to print the sum of <code>n</code> and <code>p</code> without modifying either, use <code>+</code> instead of <code>+=</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p><code>n += p</code> is equal to <code>n = n + p</code>. This is a statement on its own and cannot be printed out. You probably meant <code>print n + p</code>.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>figured it out... somewhat. taking out the print statement makes it work. I dont understand the rule here, why it breaks with print, but Ill keep looking</p>

<p>I would <strong>seriously</strong> suggest to get a book about Python and learn from that. You obviously (not meant as an insult, just informing you) have no idea what you are doing.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p><code>+=</code> is a statement. Place it on a line by itself.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>While <code>+=</code> is generally legal Python, it is syntactically not allowed at this point, so try:</p>

<pre><code>n = 1
p = 4
n += p
print n
</code></pre>
