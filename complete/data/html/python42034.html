<h3>Question (ID-42034):</h3><h2>What is a tuple useful for?</h2><p>I am learning Python for a class now, and we just covered tuples as one of the data types. I read the Wikipedia page on it, but, I could not figure out where such a data type would be useful in practice. Can I have some examples, perhaps in Python, where an immutable set of numbers would be needed? How is this different from a list?</p>

<li>Tuples are used whenever you want to return multiple results from a function.</li>
<li>Since they're immutable, they can be used as keys for a dictionary (lists can't).</li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Tuples make good dictionary keys when you need to combine more than one piece of data into your key and don't feel like making a class for it.</p>

<pre><code>a = {}
a[(1,2,"bob")] = "hello!"
a[("Hello","en-US")] = "Hi There!"
</code></pre>

<p>I've used this feature primarily to create a dictionary with keys that are coordinates of the vertices of a mesh.  However, in my particular case, the exact comparison of the floats involved worked fine which might not always be true for your purposes [in which case I'd probably convert your incoming floats to some kind of fixed-point integer]</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I like <a href="http://jtauber.com/blog/2006/04/15/python_tuples_are_not_just_constant_lists/" rel="nofollow">this explanation</a>.</p>

<p>Basically, you should use tuples when there's a constant structure (the 1st position always holds one type of value and the second another, and so forth), and lists should be used for lists of homogeneous values.</p>

<p>Of course there's always exceptions, but this is a good general guideline.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I find them useful when you always deal with two or more objects as a set.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Tuples and lists have the same uses in general. Immutable data types in general have many benefits, mostly about concurrency issues.</p>

<p>So, when you have lists that are not volatile in nature and you need to guarantee that no consumer is altering it, you may use a tuple.</p>

<p>Typical examples are fixed data in an application like company divisions, categories, etc.  If this data change, typically a single producer rebuilts the tuple.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>A list can always replace a tuple, with respect to functionality (except, apparently, as keys in a dict). However, a tuple can make things go faster. The same is true for, for example, immutable strings in Java -- when will you ever need to be unable to alter your strings? Never!</p>

<p>I just read a decent discussion on limiting what you can do in order to make better programs; <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/03/why-why-functional-programming-matters.html" rel="nofollow">Why Why Functional Programming Matters Matters</a></p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>A tuple is useful for storing multiple values.. As you note a tuple is just like a list that is immutable - e.g. once created you cannot add/remove/swap elements.</p>

<p>One benefit of being immutable is that because the tuple is fixed size it allows the run-time to perform certain optimizations. This is particularly beneficial when a tupple is used in the context of a return value or a parameter to a function.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>In addition to the places where they're syntactically required like the string % operation and for multiple return values, I use tuples as a form of lightweight classes.  For example, suppose you have an object that passes out an opaque cookie to a caller from one method which is then passed into another method.  A tuple is a good way to pack multiple values into that cookie without having to define a separate class to contain them.</p>

<p>I try to be judicious about this particular use, though.  If the cookies are used liberally throughout the code, it's better to create a class because it helps document their use. If they are only used in one place (e.g. one pair of methods) then I might use a tuple. In any case, because it's Python you can start with a tuple and then change it to an instance of a custom class without having to change any code in the caller.</p>
