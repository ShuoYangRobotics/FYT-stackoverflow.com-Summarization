<h3>Question (ID-121396):</h3><h2>Accessing object memory address</h2><p>When you call the <code>object.__repr__()</code> method in python you get something like this back: <code>&lt;__main__.Test object at 0x2aba1c0cf890&gt;</code>, is there any way to get a hold of the memory address if you overload <code>__repr__()</code>, other then calling <code>super(Class, obj).__repr__()</code> and regexing it out? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/built-in-funcs.html" rel="nofollow">Python manual</a> has this to say about id():</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Return the ``identity'' of an object.
  This is an integer (or long integer)
  which is guaranteed to be unique and
  constant for this object during its
  lifetime. Two objects with
  non-overlapping lifetimes may have the
  same id() value. (Implementation note:
  this is the address of the object.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So in CPython, this will be the address of the object. No such guarantee for any other Python interpreter, though.</p>

<p>Note that if you're writing a C extension, you have full access to the internals of the Python interpreter, including access to the addresses of objects directly.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>With <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-ctypes.html">ctypes</a>, you can achieve the same thing with</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import ctypes
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = (1,2,3)
&gt;&gt;&gt; ctypes.addressof(a)
3077760748L
</code></pre>

<p>Documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>addressof(C instance) -&gt; integer</code><br />
  Return the address of the C instance internal buffer</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that in CPython, currently <code>id(a) == ctypes.addressof(a)</code>, but <code>ctypes.addressof</code> should return the real address for each Python implementation, if</p>

<ul>
<li>ctypes is supported</li>
<li>memory pointers are a valid notion.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: added information about interpreter-independence of ctypes</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You could reimplement the default repr this way:</p>

<pre><code>def __repr__(self):
    return '&lt;%s.%s object at %s&gt;' % (
        self.__class__.__module__,
        self.__class__.__name__,
        hex(id(self))
    )
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Just use </p>

<pre><code>id(object)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Just in response to Torsten, I wasn't able to call <code>addressof()</code> on a regular python object. Furthermore, <code>id(a) != addressof(a)</code>. This is in CPython, don't know about anything else.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from ctypes import c_int, addressof
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 69
&gt;&gt;&gt; addressof(a)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: invalid type
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = c_int(69)
&gt;&gt;&gt; addressof(b)
4300673472
&gt;&gt;&gt; id(b)
4300673392
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You can get something suitable for that purpose with:</p>

<pre><code>id(self)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>While it's true that <code>id(object)</code> gets the object's address in the default CPython implementation, this is generally useless... you can't <i>do</i> anything with the address from pure Python code.</p>

<p>The only time you would actually be able to use the address is from a C extension library... in which case it is trivial to get the object's address since Python objects are always passed around as C pointers.</p>
