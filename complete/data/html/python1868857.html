<h3>Question (ID-1868857):</h3><h2>Convert and merge strings into a list in Python</h2><p>In Python I have four strings that include the formatting of a list:</p>

<pre><code>line1 ="['a.b.c','b.c.a','c.d.e']"
line2 ="['def','efg']"
line3 ="['f']"
line4 ="['g']"
</code></pre>

<p>How do I merge them all so I get a valid Python list such as:</p>

<pre><code>SumLine = ['a.b.c','b.c.a','c.d.e','def','efg','f','g']
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><pre><code>import ast

line1 ="['a.b.c','b.c.a','c.d.e']"
line2 ="['def','efg']"
line3 ="['f']"
line4 ="['g']"

SumLine = []

for x in (line1, line2, line3, line4):
  SumLine.extend(ast.literal_eval(x))

print SumLine
</code></pre>

<p>Don't use the built-in <code>eval</code> unless you have preternatural trust in the strings you're evaluating; <code>ast.literal_eval</code>, while limited to simple constants, is totally safe and therefore, most often, way preferable.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Try <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html?highlight=eval#eval" rel="nofollow">eval</a>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; line1 ="['a.b.c','b.c.a','c.d.e']"
&gt;&gt;&gt; line2 ="['def','efg']"
&gt;&gt;&gt; line3 ="['f']"
&gt;&gt;&gt; line4 ="['g']"
&gt;&gt;&gt; eval(line1) + eval(line2) + eval(line3) + eval(line4)
['a.b.c', 'b.c.a', 'c.d.e', 'def', 'efg', 'f', 'g']
</code></pre>

<p>But be careful, because <code>eval</code> can be dangerous.  Don't use it on input that you receive from the user and haven't validated.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>The quick and dirty way is to use <code>eval</code>:</p>

<pre><code>SumLine = eval(line1) + eval(line2) + eval(line3) + eval(line4)
</code></pre>

<p>But dont do this if you are getting these strings from someone else (ie user input)</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The simple way is to concetenate the strings to an expression that can be evaulated to give the required result:</p>

<pre><code>line1 ="['a.b.c','b.c.a','c.d.e']"
line2 ="['def','efg']"
line3 ="['f']"
line4 ="['g']"
lines = [line1, line2, line3, line4]

print eval('+'.join(lines))
</code></pre>

<p>However this is unsafe if you can't trust your input, so if you're using Python 2.6 or higher you should use the safe eval function <code>ast.literal_eval</code> in the ast module, although this doesn't work with the '+' trick so you will have to iterate over each element instead.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Where did you get these strings? Anything short of a real parser will be fragile. Below is what I would recommed, if I had not seen Alex Martelli's brilliant answer before!</p>

<p>You may parse them as JSON arrays, but JSON wants to read double-quoted strings, not single quotes. This introduces fragility to the method, but still much preferable to <code>eval()</code> which is unsafe.</p>

<pre><code>import json
line1 ="['a.b.c','b.c.a','c.d.e']"
json.loads(line1.replace("'", '"'))
</code></pre>

<p>The result is a parsed list like <code>[u'a.b.c', u'b.c.a', u'c.d.e']</code>, you may than go on to join the parsed lists.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>you need to <code>eval</code> them first and then you could sum the results. But I wonder how do you get this strings in the first place?</p>
