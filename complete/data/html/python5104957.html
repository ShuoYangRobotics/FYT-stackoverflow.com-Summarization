<p>where is the file created? How can I create a file on a specific path?</p>

<p>In the application's current working directory. You can use <code>os.getcwd</code> to check it, and <code>os.chdir</code> to change it.</p>

<p>Opening file in the root directory probably fails due to lack of privileges.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The file path <code>"c:\Test\blah"</code> will have a tab character for the `\T'.  You need to use either:</p>

<pre><code>"C:\\Test"
</code></pre>

<p>or </p>

<pre><code>r"C:\Test"
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>It will be created once you close the file (with or without writing). Use <code>os.path.join()</code> to create your path eg</p>

<pre><code>filepath = os.path.join("c:\\","test.py")
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The file is created wherever the root of the python interpreter was started.</p>

<p>Eg, you start python in <code>/home/user/program</code>, then the file "test.py" would be located at <code>/home/user/program/test.py</code></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>f = open("test.py", "a")   Will be created in whatever directory the python file is run from.</p>

<p>I'm not sure about the other error...I don't work in windows.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>The besty practice is to use '/' and a so called 'raw string' to define file path in Python.</p>

<pre><code>path = r"C:/Test.py"
</code></pre>

<p>However, a normal program may not have the permission to write in the <code>C:</code> drive root directory. You may need to allow your program to do so, or choose something more reasonable since you probably not need to do so.</p>
