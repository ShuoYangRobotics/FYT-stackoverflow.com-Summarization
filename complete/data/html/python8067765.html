<h3>Question (ID-8067765):</h3><h2>python list copy: is there a difference between old[:] and list(old)?</h2><pre><code>old = [1, 2, 3]
</code></pre>

<p>What is the difference between the following two lines (if there is any)?</p>

<pre><code>new = old[:]
new = list(old)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update</strong> I had already accepted ubershmekel's answer but later I've learned an interesting fact: <code>[:]</code> is faster for small list (10 elements) but <code>list()</code> is faster for larger list (100000 elements). </p>

<pre><code>~$ python -S -mtimeit -s "a = list(range(10))" "a[:]"
1000000 loops, best of 3: 0.198 usec per loop
~$ python -S -mtimeit -s "a = list(range(10))" "list(a)"
1000000 loops, best of 3: 0.453 usec per loop
~$ python -S -mtimeit -s "a = list(range(100000))" "a[:]"
1000 loops, best of 3: 675 usec per loop
~$ python -S -mtimeit -s "a = list(range(100000))" "list(a)"
1000 loops, best of 3: 664 usec per loop

<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Yes there's a small difference. There was a discussion on this at <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/m1zes/python_copying_a_list_the_right_way/">/r/python</a> recently after <a href="http://henry.precheur.org/python/copy_list">this blog post</a> explained a readability difference, that <code>[:]</code> doesn't work with generators and keeps the same type as the original.</p>

<p>Technically, you get the same thing - a brand new list that still points to the same objects. Choose whichever one you like better (although <code>[:]</code> is a bit faster). Personally I agree with the blog post that <code>list(old)</code> is more readable.</p>

<p>To answer the comment about the specific difference, in python 3.2:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import dis
&gt;&gt;&gt; def colon(x):
...     return x[:]
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; def new_list(x):
...     return list(x)
...
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; dis.dis(colon)
  2           0 LOAD_FAST                0 (x)
              3 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)
              6 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)
              9 BUILD_SLICE              2
             12 BINARY_SUBSCR
             13 RETURN_VALUE
&gt;&gt;&gt; dis.dis(new_list)
  2           0 LOAD_GLOBAL              0 (list)
              3 LOAD_FAST                0 (x)
              6 CALL_FUNCTION            1
              9 RETURN_VALUE
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Why <code>list(old)</code> is slower I think is because the slicing mechanism doesn't need to "LOAD_GLOBAL" and "CALL_FUNCTION" on the list constructor, the entire operation is handled in C.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>If old is not a list, old[:] will be all the elements of old in the same kind of container as old (maybe a tuple or a string), while list(old) will be a list with the same elements.</p>

<p>I.e. if old is the string 'foo', old[:] will be the string 'foo', while list(old) wille be the list ['f', 'o', 'o'].</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If <em>old</em> is an array, then both are equivalent.  But if old is some sort of iterator, only the <em>list()</em> syntax will work.  For that reason, the second syntax is probably preferable, as it is more general.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p><code>new = old[:]</code> creates a copy of list <code>old</code> using the slice notation and stores it in <code>new</code>.</p>

<p><code>new = list(old)</code> casts <code>old</code> to type <code>list</code>. It is already a list and it is assigned into <code>new</code>.</p>

<p>I believe these both give the same result. That is, <code>new</code> contains a copy of <code>old</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Nobody has yet mentioned that this functional difference between the two; list(a_generator) will work, while a_generator[:] makes no sense:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; i = iter([1,2,3])
&gt;&gt;&gt; i[:]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: 'listiterator' object is not subscriptable
&gt;&gt;&gt; list(i)
[1, 2, 3]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>In the example you give, there is no difference:  both result in a brand new <code>list</code> object with the same elements.</p>

<p>In general</p>

<ul>
<li><code>new = old[:]</code> will only work with objects that support slices, and <code>new</code> will be the same type as old</li>
<li><code>new = list(old)</code> will work with any iterable, and <code>new</code> will be a <code>list</code></li>
</ul>
