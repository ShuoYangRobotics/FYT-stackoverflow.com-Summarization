<h3>Question (ID-184742):</h3><h2>What is a good CMS written in Python (and not Plone)?</h2><p>I've been doing CMS sites for clients using Joomla for a while now, but I've been migrating a lot of my coding over to Python and have been looking for a good CMS solution that's written in Python.</p>

<p>Most of what I've seen so far is either Zope based (Plone) or Django based. I'm not totally opposed to something written in a Python framework such as Django, but I don't want to use Zope (seems to me to have too much "bloat" for something like this).</p>

<p>Is there anything in the Python community like Joomla? I know I could always "roll my own", but I'd rather use something pre-built (if there is such a thing).</p>

<p>Thanks for your time,
Seth</p>

It is a good start to build your cms on it. There is a <a href="http://jtauber.com/blog/2008/09/16/my_talk_on_pinax_at_djangocon/" rel="nofollow">video</a> available presenting it a djangoconf.</p>

<p>Feature List:</p>

<ul>

<li>password management</li>
<li>site announcements</li>
<li>a notification framework</li>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Unfortunately, there's really not a lot of mature CMSes out there for Python.  Here are a couple of choices though:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://orangoo.com/skeletonz/" rel="nofollow">Skeletonz</a> (still in beta)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.pylucid.org/" rel="nofollow">PyLucid</a> (haven't actually tried them out, but couldn't get past the constant grammatical and spelling errors) (which are probably because it's made by Germans)</li>
<li><a href="http://moinmo.in/" rel="nofollow">MoinMoin</a> is very mature, but isn't really made for CMS stuff.  With that said, if you spend some time with it, you can mod it to do CMS-like stuff.</li>
</ul>

<p>So with that said, your best bet may actually be to roll your own in Django or something similar.  </p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Considering this now it looks like the two best contenders are Django CMS 2.0 and Fein CMS. Here's Fein. You'll have to find Django CMS 2 yourself, because I can only post one link. =) </p>

<p><a href="http://spinlock.ch/pub/feincms/" rel="nofollow">http://spinlock.ch/pub/feincms/</a></p>

<p>They're not as complete as drupal, but in contexts where you want to write code alongside a CMS, they may be a better choice than Drupal.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I did a similar investigation a while ago, and settled on Plone. It does wrap most of the Zope complexity fairly well, but it continues to seem heavy-weight for what it does. Then again, the functionality offered is fairly substantial, so some trade-off in terms of increased complexity should be expected.</p>

<p>I'd recommend giving Plone a go; the unified installer means you can build and run it up very easily (it includes its own version of Python, stuck as it is on 2.4).</p>

<p>All that said, if I wanted to build another CMS-based site, I'd go with something non-Python, such as Drupal (PHP).</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Take a look at <a href="http://www.merengueproject.org/" rel="nofollow">Merengue CMS</a>, is a new django CMS with a lot of features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pluggable</li>
<li>GIS integrated</li>
<li>Out-of-the-box caching</li>
<li>Page sorting, Drag and drop, WYSIWYG Editor</li>
<li>Theming</li>
<li>Full featured management interface</li>
<li>Collaborative edition</li>
<li>i18n. Translation tools (django-inlinetrans,django-transmeta,Transhette)</li>
<li>South</li>
<li>pypi</li>
<li>Extensible data schema. Not hierarchical pages</li>
<li>Unit tests and selenium test suites</li>
</ul>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.lfcproject.com/" rel="nofollow">Lighting Fast CMS</a> is a promising new kid on the block.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward on its development.</p>

<p>LFC is Django based.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>The code that runs <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/" rel="nofollow">djangoproject.com</a> is good, but not really released as a package. You can grab the <a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/browser/djangoproject.com/django_website/" rel="nofollow">source</a> though, and tweak it for your needs. </p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>I would say <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" rel="nofollow">Django</a> is one of the better options out there. Version 1.3 has been released and with things like the form processing, out-of-the-bix admin site and templating language a very good option.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>You know, you can use a different back-end with Plone if you don't like Zope.</p>

<br /><b>#9</b><br /><h2>Python</h2>

<p>zope2 + CMS = plone &lt; Zope3 + CMS = Z3Ext</p>

<p>(<a href="http://z3ext.net/" rel="nofollow">http://z3ext.net/</a>)</p>
<br /><b>#10</b><br /><p>If you are looking to manage media or podcasts a good <a href="http://getmediacore.com" rel="nofollow">python-based CMS solution is MediaCore</a>. It just launched this last week and really looks like a solid content management system. The design is sleek and for organizing, tagging, and managing videos or podcasts it looks like a great solution.</p>
<br /><b>#11</b><br /><p>It might look a bit oldfashioned but you should give ZMS a try:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.zms-publishing.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.zms-publishing.com/</a></p>
<br /><b>#12</b><br /><p>At the moment there is a relatively new one in active development named <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Kotti" rel="nofollow">Kotti</a> (<a href="https://github.com/Pylons/Kotti" rel="nofollow">Github</a>).</p>

<p>So as @Jason Baker already mentioned, there are not a lot of options in the python world. From my point of view the only mature CMS are <a href="http://plone.org/" rel="nofollow">plone</a>, <a href="http://www.django-cms.org/" rel="nofollow">django-cms</a> and <a href="http://www.merengueproject.org/" rel="nofollow">merengue</a>. And maybe soon <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Kotti" rel="nofollow">Kotti</a> can catch up.</p>
