<h3>Question (ID-550470):</h3><h2>overload print python</h2><p>Am i able to overload the print function? and call the normal function? What i want to do is after a specific line i want print to call my print which will call the normal print and write a copy to file.</p>

<p>Also i dont know how to overload print. I dont know how to do variable length arguments. i'll look it up soon but  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/550470/overload-print-python/550477#550477">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/550470/overload-print-python/550477#550477</a> just told me i cant overload print in 2.x which is what i am using.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Overloading <code>print</code> is a design feature of python 3.0 to address your lack of ability to do so in python 2.x.</p>

<p>However, you can override sys.stdout. (<a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/119404/" rel="nofollow">example</a>.) Just assign it to another file-like object that does what you want.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you could just pipe your script through the the unix <code>tee</code> command. <code>python yourscript.py | tee output.txt</code> will print to both stdout and to output.txt, but this will capture all output.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I came across the same problem.</p>

<p>How about this:</p>

<pre><code>class writer :
    def __init__(self, *writers) :
    	self.writers = writers

    def write(self, text) :
    	for w in self.writers :
    		w.write(text)

import sys

saved = sys.stdout
fout = file('out.log', 'w')
sys.stdout = writer(sys.stdout, fout)
print "There you go."
sys.stdout = saved
fout.close()
</code></pre>

<p>It worked like a charm for me.

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I don't think you can overload print, but Python has a robust logging package that is highly customizable.</p>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>In Python 2.x you can't, because print isn't a function, it's a statement. In Python 3 print is a function, so I suppose it could be overridden (haven't tried it, though).</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Though you can't replace the <code>print</code> keyword (in Python 2.x <code>print</code> is a keyword), it's common practice to replace <code>sys.stdout</code> to do something similar to <code>print</code> overriding; for example, with an instance of <code>StringIO.StringIO</code>. This will capture all of the printed data in the <code>StringIO</code> instance, after which you can manipulate it.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I answered the same question <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/770657/python-overridding-print/1818572#1818572">on a different SO question</a></p>

<p>Essentially, simplest solution is to just redirect the output to stderr as follows, in the wsgi config file.</p>

<pre><code>sys.stdout = sys.stderr
</code></pre>
