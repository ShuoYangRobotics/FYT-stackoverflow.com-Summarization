<h3>Question (ID-1842941):</h3><h2>Translating python dictionary to C++</h2><p>I have python code that contains the following code. </p>

<pre><code>d = {}

d[(0,0)] = 0
d[(1,2)] = 1
d[(2,1)] = 2
d[(2,3)] = 3
d[(3,2)] = 4

for (i,j) in d:
    print d[(i,j)], d[(j,i)]
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately looping over all the keys in python isn't really fast enough for my purpose, and I would like to translate this code to C++. What is the best C++ data structure to use for a python dictionary that has tuples as its keys? What would be the C++ equivalent of the above code?</p>

<p>I looked at sparse matrices in the boost library, but couldn't find an easy way to loop only over the non-zero elements.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>A dictionary would be a std::map in c++, and a tuple with two elements would be a std::pair.</p>

<p>The python code provided would translate to:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;map&gt;

typedef std::map&lt;std::pair&lt;int, int&gt;, int&gt; Dict;
typedef Dict::const_iterator It;

int main()
{
   Dict d;

   d[std::make_pair(0, 0)] = 0;
   d[std::make_pair(1, 2)] = 1;
   d[std::make_pair(2, 1)] = 2;
   d[std::make_pair(2, 3)] = 3;
   d[std::make_pair(3, 2)] = 4;

   for (It it(d.begin()); it != d.end(); ++it)
   {
      int i(it-&gt;first.first);
      int j(it-&gt;first.second);
      std::cout &lt;&lt;it-&gt;second &lt;&lt;' '
                &lt;&lt;d[std::make_pair(j, i)] &lt;&lt;'\n';
   }
}
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The type is</p>

<pre><code>std::map&lt; std::pair&lt;int,int&gt;, int&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The code to add entries to map is like here:</p>

<pre><code>typedef  std::map&lt; std::pair&lt;int,int&gt;, int&gt; container;

container m;

m[ make_pair(1,2) ] = 3; //...

for(container::iterator i = m.begin();  i != m.end(); ++i){
   std::cout &lt;&lt; i.second &lt;&lt; ' '; 
   // not really sure how to translate [i,j] [j,i] idiom here easily
}
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><code>std::map</code> or more likely <code>std::tr1::unordered_map</code> / <code>boost::unordered_map</code> (aka <code>hash_map</code>) is what you want. </p>

<p>Also, as kriss said, Boost.Python is a good idea to look at here. It provides a C++ version of python's dict class already, so if you're doing cross-language stuff, it might be useful.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Have a look at <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1%5F41%5F0/libs/python/doc/index.html" rel="nofollow">Boost.python</a>. It's for interaction between python and C++ (basically building python libs using C++, but also for embedding python in C++ programs). Most pythons data structures and their C++ equivalents are described (didn't checked for the one you want).</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Do you want to call an optimized C++ routine via Python?  If so, read on:</p>

<p>Often times I use <a href="http://pyyaml.org/" rel="nofollow">PyYaml</a> when dealing with dictionaries in Python.  Perhaps you could link in something like <a href="http://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML" rel="nofollow">LibYAML</a> or <a href="http://www.x37v.info/projects/cpp/yaml/" rel="nofollow">yamlcpp</a> to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Translate a Python dictionary into a YAML string</li>
<li>Use Python to call a C++ function wrapped using something like <a href="http://www.swig.org/" rel="nofollow">SWIG</a>, taking the YAML string as a parameter.</li>
<li>Use a C++ library to parse the YAML &amp; obtain a <code>std::map</code> object</li>
<li>Operate on std::map object</li>
</ol>

<p>Warning:  I have never tried this, but using everyone's favorite search engine on <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=yaml+std" rel="nofollow">"yaml std::map"</a> yields lots of interesting links</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>As a direct answer to your question (for the python part look at my other answer). You can forget the tuple part if you want. You can use any mapping type key/value (hash, etc.) in C++, you just have to find a unique key function. In some cases that can be easy. For instance if you two integers are integers between 1 and 65536 you just could use a 32 bits integer with each 16 bits part one of the keys. A simple shift and an 'or' or + to combine the two values would do the trick and it's very efficient.</p>
