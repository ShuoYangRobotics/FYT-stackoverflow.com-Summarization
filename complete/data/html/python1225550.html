<h3>Question (ID-1225550):</h3><h2>Need to make multiple files from a single excel file</h2><p>I have a excel file. With many columns . I need to make multiple files using this </p>

<p>Eg:   0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2. So these are the excel columns with each having many rows. I need one file which would contain 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 2 then second will contain only the second no 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1   2....similarly the others. </p>

<p>Thank you all for ur reply. To simplify the question: </p>

<ol>
<li>I have a excel file as i mentioned with number of columns and rows. The columns are named as  </li>
</ol>

<p><img src="http://img44.imageshack.us/img44/3397/84200961244pm.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>Now I need to split this file into many excel files the 1st will have </p>

<p>A to O columns with all rows. The second will have A to N + P(this will not have columns O) and similarly the other 2. There will be like many columns with 2 and i will have to make a file containg all the columns containing O and 1 and each 2 at a time. i.e 1st 2 then the 2nd 2 and so on. </p>

Unfortunately that is all I can help you with because, frankly, the description of your problem makes no sense.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Use Python and xlrd &amp; xlwt. See <a href="http://www.python-excel.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.python-excel.org</a></p>

<p>The following script should do what you want:</p>

<pre><code>import xlrd, xlwt, sys

def raj_split(in_path, out_stem):
    in_book = xlrd.open_workbook(in_path)
    in_sheet = in_book.sheet_by_index(0)
    first_row = in_sheet.row_values(0)
    # find the rightmost 1 value in the first row
    split_pos = max(
        colx for colx, value in enumerate(first_row) if value == 1.0
        ) + 1
    out_book = xlwt.Workbook()
    out_sheet = out_book.add_sheet("Sheet1", cell_overwrite_ok=True)
    # copy the common cells
    for rowx in xrange(in_sheet.nrows):
        row_vals = in_sheet.row_values(rowx, end_colx=split_pos)
        for colx in xrange(split_pos):
            out_sheet.write(rowx, colx, row_vals[colx])
    out_num = 0
    # for each output file ...
    for out_col in range(split_pos, in_sheet.ncols):
        out_num += 1
        # ... overwrite the `split_pos` column
        for rowx, value in enumerate(in_sheet.col_values(colx=out_col)):
            out_sheet.write(rowx, split_pos, value)
        # ... and save the file.
        out_book.save("%s_%03d.xls" % (out_stem, out_num))

raj_split(*sys.argv[1:3])

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>In python, you can use <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlrd" rel="nofollow">xlrd</a> to read an Excel spreadsheet into data you can work with.  See the <a href="http://www.lexicon.net/sjmachin/README.html" rel="nofollow">README</a> for sample usage.  You can then use <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlwt" rel="nofollow">xlwt</a> to create new spreadsheets.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>in Excel, save your file as CSV.</p>

<p>in Python, use the CSV reader module to read it (read the python docs, search for csv)</p>

<p>now you say you have rows of maybe 20 columns and you want to put columns 1..10 in file A and columns 11..20 in file B, yes ?</p>

<p>open 2 csv writers (let's call them A and B)</p>

<p>you will read rows :</p>

<p>for row in csvreader:
    A.writerow( row[:10 ] )
    B.writerow( row[11: ] )</p>

<p>that's it.</p>

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>As others have commented your question is almost totally incomprehensible.  Based on the difficulty you have describing your issue, you might want to take a look at 
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1120016/hash-arrays-combining-files-how/1122992#1122992">this post</a>.</p>

<p>Some here have suggested saving your file as a CSV.  Saving your file as a CSV file will greatly simplify the job of parsing it, but it will make converting to and from excel format a manual process.  This may be acceptable if you have a small number of files to process.  If you have hundreds, it won't work so well.  </p>

<p>The <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Spreadsheet-ParseExcel/lib/Spreadsheet/ParseExcel.pm" rel="nofollow">Spreadsheet::ParseExcel</a> and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Spreadsheet-WriteExcel/" rel="nofollow">Spreadsheet::WriteExcel</a> modules will help your read and write your spreadsheet file in native format.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Text-CSV%5FXS/" rel="nofollow">Text::CSV_XS</a> module provides a powerful, fast CSV parser for perl.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I think the <a href="http://www.lexicon.net/sjmachin/xlrd.htm" rel="nofollow">xlrd</a> and xlwt modules are the way to go in Python.</p>

<pre><code># Read the first 5 rows and columns of an excel file
import xlrd # Import the package
book = xlrd.open_workbook("sample.xls") # Open an .xls file
sheet = book.sheet_by_index(0) # Get the first sheet
for row in range(5): # Loop for five times (five rows)
    # grab the current row
    rowValues = sheet.row_values(row, start_col=0, end_colx=4)
    # Do magic here, like printing
    import xlrd # Import the package
    print "%-10s | %-10s | %-10s | %-10s | %-10s" % tuple(rowValues)
</code></pre>

<p>Now if you feel like writing back Excel files...</p>

<pre><code>import xlwt # Import the package
wbook = xlwt.Workbook() # Create a new workbook
sheet = wbook.add_sheet("Sample Sheet") # Create a sheet
data = "Sample data" # Something to write into the sheet
for rowx in range(5):
    # Loop through the first five rows
    for colx in range(5):
        # Loop through the first five columns
        # Write the data to rox, column
        sheet.write(rowx, colx, data)
# Save our workbook on the harddrive
wbook.save(&amp;amp;quot;myFile.xls&amp;amp;quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>I have used this method in the part extensively to read/write data from Excel files for Input/Output models to use in NetworkX. The above examples are from my blog entries talking about that adventure.</p>

<p>As I am a new user, I can only post one link. Maybe you can Google xlwt? :)</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Actually, this is exactly what xlutils' filter functionality was designed for.</p>

<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>You could use Visual Basic for Applications to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa221353%28office.11%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">loop over the cells</a> and then <a href="http://www.vbaexpress.com/kb/getarticle.php?kb%5Fid=805" rel="nofollow">save to a text file</a>.</p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>Save the file as a comma separated value file and use perl or python to easily parse the lines. (split on the comma for columns, end of line character for rows)</p>
