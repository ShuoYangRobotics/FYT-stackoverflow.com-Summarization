<h3>Question (ID-315165):</h3><h2>How to debug Web2py applications?</h2><p>Is it possible? 
By debug I mean setting breakpoints, inspect values and advance step by step.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I haven't used web2py, but if it runs in a terminal window, you can use standard pdb stuff. Add this line somewhere in your code:</p>

<pre><code>import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
</code></pre>

<p>This will invoke the debugger and break.  Then you can use <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-pdb.html" rel="nofollow">PDB</a> commands: n to step to the next line, l to list code, s to step into a function, p to print values, etc.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You can do remote debugging of python web apps over TCP/IP with <a href="http://winpdb.org/" rel="nofollow">winpdb</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>One can debug applications built on Web2py using the following set-up:</p>

<ol>
<li>Eclipse IDE</li>
<li>Install Pydev into Eclipse</li>
<li>Set Breakpoints on your code as needed</li>
<li>Within Eclipse right-click the file web2py.py and select Debug As -> Python Run</li>
<li>When a breakpoint is hit Eclipse will jump to the breakpoint where you can inspect variables and step thru the code</li>
</ol>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Yes, it is possible, Due to the "span prevention" I am still not allowed to post screenshots, but here is a full screenshot hosted at my website:</p>

<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>As Carl stated, it is as easy as:</p>

<ol>
<li>Installing PyDev in Eclipse</li>
<li>Right Click on your Web2Py project, selecting Debug As > Python Run</li>
<li>Selecting web2py.py as the file to run</li>
</ol>

<p>No other plugins or downloads are needed.</p>
