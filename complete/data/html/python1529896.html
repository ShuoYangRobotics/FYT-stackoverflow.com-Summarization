<h3>Question (ID-1529896):</h3><h2>Debugging a scripting language like ruby</h2><p>I am basically from the world of C language programming, now delving into the world of scripting languages like Ruby and Python.</p>

<p>I am wondering how to do debugging.
At present the steps I follow is, </p>

<ul>
<li>I complete a large script,</li>
<li>Comment everything but the portion I
want to check</li>
<li>Execute the script</li>
</ul>

<p>Though it works, I am not able to debug like how I would do in, say, a VC++ environment or something like that.</p>

<p>My question is, is there any better way of debugging?</p>

<p>Note: I guess it may be a repeated question, if so, please point me to the answer.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-11):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Your sequence seems entirely backwards to me.  Here's how I do it:</p>

<ol>
<li>I write a test for the functionality I want.</li>
<li>I start writing the script, executing bits and verifying test results.</li>
<li>I review what I'd done to document and publish.</li>
</ol>

<p>Specifically, I execute <em>before</em> I complete.  It's way too late by then.</p>

<p>There are debuggers, of course, but with good tests and good design, I've almost never needed one.</p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Seems like the problem here is that your environment (Visual Studio) doesn't support these languages, not that these languages don't support debuggers in general.</p>

<p>Perl, Python, and Ruby all have fully-featured debuggers; you can find other IDEs that help you, too. For Ruby, there's <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/index.html" rel="nofollow">RubyMine</a>; for Perl, there's <a href="http://www.activestate.com/komodo" rel="nofollow">Komodo</a>. And that's just off the top of my head.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>There is a nice gentle introduction to the Python debugger <a href="http://pythonconquerstheuniverse.wordpress.com/category/the-python-debugger/" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>If you're working with Python then you can find a list of debugging tools <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/477193/suggestions-for-python-debugging-tools">here</a> to which I just want to add <a href="http://eclipse.org/" rel="nofollow">Eclipse</a> with the <a href="http://pydev.org/" rel="nofollow">Pydev extension</a>, which makes working with breakpoints etc. also very simple.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Script languages have no differences compared with other languages in the sense that you still have to break your problems into manageable pieces -- that is, functions. So, instead of testing the whole script after finishing the whole script, I prefer to test those small functions before integrating them.  TDD always helps.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>My question is, is there any better way of debugging?"</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Your approach, "1. I complete a large script, 2. Comment everything but the portion I want to check, 3. Execute the script" is not really the best way to write any software in any language (sorry, but that's the truth.)</p>

<p>Do not write a large anything.  Ever.</p>

<p>Do this.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Decompose your problem into classes of objects.</p></li>
<li><p>For each class, write the class by</p>

<p>2a.  Outline the class, focus on the external interface, not the implementation details.</p>

<p>2b.  Write tests to prove that interface works.</p>

<p>2c.  Run the tests.  They'll fail, since you only outlined the class.</p>

<p>2d.  Fix the class until it passes the test.</p>

<p>2e.  At some points, you'll realize your class designs aren't optimal.  Refactor your design, assuring your tests still pass.</p></li>
<li><p>Now, write your final script.  It should be short.  All the classes have already been tested.</p>

<p>3a.  Outline the script.  Indeed, you can usually write the script.</p>

<p>3b.  Write some test cases that prove the script works.</p>

<p>3c.  Runt the tests.  They may pass.  You're done.</p>

<p>3d.  If the tests don't pass, fix things until they do.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Write many small things.  It works out much better in the long run that writing a large thing and commenting parts of it out.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>There's a lot of good advice here, i recommend going through some best practices:</p>

<p>(and read Greg Brown's book, it's superb)</p>

<p>You talk about large scripts. A lot of my workflow is working out logic in irb or the python shell, then capturing them into a cascade of small, single-task focused methods, with appropriate tests (not 100% coverage, more focus on edge and corner cases).</p>

<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>There's a SO question on Ruby IDEs <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/59968/best-editor-or-ide-for-ruby">here</a> - and searching for "ruby IDE" offers more.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I complete a large script</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's what caught my eye: "complete", to me, means "done", "finished", "released". Whether or not you write tests before writing the functions that pass them, or whether or not you write tests at all (and I recommend that you do) you should not be writing code that can't be run (which is a test in itself) until it's become large. Ruby and Python offer a multitude of ways to write small, individually-testable (or executable) pieces of code, so that you don't have to wait for (?) days before you can run the thing.</p>

<p>I'm building a (Ruby) database translation/transformation script at the moment - it's up to about 1000 lines and still not done. I seldom go more than 5 minutes without running it, or at least running the part on which I'm working. When it breaks (I'm not perfect, it breaks a lot ;-p) I know where the problem must be - in the code I wrote in the last 5 minutes. Progress is pretty fast.</p>

<p>I'm not asserting that IDEs/debuggers have no place: some problems don't surface until a large body of code is released: it can be really useful on occasion to drop the whole thing into a debugging environment to find out what is going on. When third-party libraries and frameworks are involved it can be extremely useful to debug into their code to locate problems (which are usually - but not always - related to faulty understanding of the library function).</p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>You can debug your Python scripts using the included pdb module.  If you want a visual debugger, you can download <a href="http://winpdb.org/" rel="nofollow">winpdb</a> - don't be put off by that "win" prefix, winpdb is cross-platform.</p>
<br /><b>#10</b><br /><p>The debugging method you described is perfect for a static language like C++, but given that the language is so different, the coding methods are similarly different. One of the big very important things in a dynamic language such as Python or Ruby is the interactive toplevel (what you get by typing, say <code>python</code> on the command line). This means that running a part of your program is very easy.</p>

<p>Even if you've written a large program before testing (which is a bad idea), it is hopefully separated into many functions. So, open up your interactive toplevel, do an <code>import thing</code> (for whatever <code>thing</code> happens to be) and then you can easily start testing your functions one by one, just calling them on the toplevel.</p>

<p>Of course, for a more mature project, you probably want to write out an actual test suite, and most languages have a method to do that (in Python, this is <code>doctest</code> and <code>nose</code>, don't know about other languages). At first, though, when you're writing something not particularly formal, just remember a few simple rules of debugging dynamic languages:</p>

<ul>
<li>Start small. Don't write large programs and test them. Test each function as you write it, at least cursorily.</li>
<li>Use the toplevel. Running small pieces of code in a language like Python is extremely lightweight: fire up the toplevel and run it. Compare with writing a complete program and the compile-running it in, say, C++. Use that fact that you can quickly change the correctness of any function.</li>
<li>Debuggers are handy. But often, so are <code>print</code> statements. If you're only running a single function, debugging with <code>print</code> statements isn't that inconvenient, and also frees you from dragging along an IDE.</li>
</ul>
