<h3>Question (ID-2798627):</h3><h2>How can I detect DOS line breaks in a file?</h2><p>I have a bunch of files.  Some are Unix line endings, many are DOS.  I'd like to test each file to see if if is dos formatted, before I switch the line endings.</p>

<p>How would I do this?  Is there a flag I can test for? Something similar?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Python can <em>automatically detect what newline convention is used in a file</em>, and you can access Python's guess through the <code>newlines</code> attribute of file objects:</p>

<pre><code>f = open('myfile.txt', 'U')
f.readline()  # Reads a line
# The following now contains the newline ending of the first line:
# It can be "\r\n" (Windows), "\n" (Unix), "\r" (old Mac OS).
# If no newline is found, it contains None.
print repr(f.newlines)
</code></pre>

<p>This gives the newline ending of the first line (Unix, DOS, etc.), if any.  As John M. pointed out, if by any chance you have a pathological file that uses more than one newline coding, <code>f.newlines</code> is a tuple with all the newline codings found so far, after reading many lines.</p>

<p>If you just want to convert all files, you can simply do:</p>

<pre><code>text = open('myfile.txt', 'U').read()  # Automatic ("Universal read") conversion of newlines to "\n"
open('myfile.txt', 'w').write(text)  # Writes newlines for your platform
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You could search the string for <code>\r\n</code>. That's DOS style line ending.</p>

<p>EDIT: Take a look at <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/66434-change-line-endings/" rel="nofollow">this</a></p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If you just want to read text files, either DOS or Unix-formatted, this works:</p>

<pre><code>print open('myfile.txt', 'U').read()
</code></pre>

<p>That is, Python's "universal" file reader will automatically use all the different end of line markers, translating them to "\n".</p>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>As a complete Python newbie &amp; just for fun, I tried to find some minimalistic way of checking this for one file. This seems to work:</p>

<pre><code>if "\r\n" in open("/path/file.txt","rb").read():
    print "DOS line endings found"
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: simplified as per John Machin's comment (no need to use regular expressions).</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>dos linebreaks are <code>\r\n</code>, unix only <code>\n</code>. So just search for <code>\r\n</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Using grep &amp; bash:</p>

<pre><code>grep -c -m 1 $'\r$' file

echo $'\r\n\r\n' | grep -c $'\r$'     # test

echo $'\r\n\r\n' | grep -c -m 1 $'\r$'  
</code></pre>
