<h3>Question (ID-2668909):</h3><h2>How to find the real user home directory using python?</h2><p>I see that if we change the HOME(linux) or USERPROFILE(windows) environmental variable and run a python script, it returns the new value as the user home when I tried,
os.environ['HOME']
os.exp</p>

<p>Is there any way to find the real user home directory without relying on the environmental variable?. Thanx.<br/>

Here is a way to find userhome in windows by reading in the registry,<br/>

One way to find windows home using pywin32,</p>

<pre><code>from win32com.shell import shell,shellcon
home = shell.SHGetFolderPath(0, shellcon.CSIDL_PROFILE, None, 0)
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>On Unix and Windows, return the argument with an initial component of <code>~</code>  or <code>~user</code> replaced by that user‘s home directory.</p>
  
  <p>On Unix, an initial <code>~</code> is replaced by the environment variable HOME if it is set; otherwise the current user’s home directory is looked up in the password directory through the built-in module <code>pwd</code>. <strong>An initial <code>~user</code> is looked up directly in the password directory</strong>.</p>
  
  <p>On Windows, HOME and USERPROFILE will be used if set, otherwise a <strong>combination of HOMEPATH and HOMEDRIVE</strong> will be used. <strong>An initial <code>~user</code> is handled by stripping the last directory component from the created user path derived above</strong>.</p>
  
  <p>If the expansion fails or if the path does not begin with a tilde, the path is returned unchanged.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you could just do:</p>

<pre><code>os.path.expanduser('~user')
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I think <code>os.path.expanduser(path)</code> is the best answer to your question, but there's an alternative that may be worth mentioning in the Unix world: the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/pwd.html" rel="nofollow"><code>pwd</code></a> package. e.g.</p>

<pre><code>import os, pwd

pwd.getpwuid(os.getuid()).pw_dir
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Really, a change in environment variable indicates that the home must be changed. So every program/script should have the new home in context; also the consequences are up to the person who changed it. 
I would still stick with 
<code>home = os.getenv('USERPROFILE') or os.getenv('HOME')</code></p>

<p>what exactly is required?</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>On Linux and other UNIXoids you can always take a peek in <code>/etc/passwd</code>. The home directory is the sixth colon-separated field in there. No idea on how to do better than the environment variable on Windows though. There'll be a system call for it, but if it's available from Python, ...</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>home_folder = os.getenv('HOME')</p>

<p>this should work on Windows and Mac OS too. Works fine on Linux.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You may want to checkout unix command(shortcut): <code>~user</code>
It takes you to home directory of current user.</p>

<p>On windows have no idea.</p>
