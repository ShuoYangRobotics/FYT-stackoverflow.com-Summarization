<h3>Question (ID-2452321):</h3><h2>Python: Create a duplicate of an array</h2><p>I have an double array</p>

<pre><code>alist[1][1]=-1
alist2=[]
for x in xrange(10):
    alist2.append(alist[x])
alist2[1][1]=15

print alist[1][1]
</code></pre>

<p>and I get 15.  Clearly I'm passing a pointer rather than an actual variable... Is there an easy way to make a <strong>seperate</strong> double array (no shared pointers) <strong>without having to do a double for loop</strong>?</p>

<p>Thanks,
Dan</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>A list of lists is not usually a great solution for making a 2d array. You probably want to use numpy, which provides a very useful, efficient n-dimensional array type. numpy arrays can be copied.</p>

<p>Other solutions that are usually better than a plain list of lists include a dict with tuples as keys (<code>d[1, 1]</code> would be the 1, 1 component) or defining your own 2d array class. Of course, dicts can be copied and you could abstract copying away for your class.</p>

<p>To copy a list of lists, you can use <code>copy.deepcopy</code>, which will go one level deep when copying.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You can use <code>somelist[:]</code>, that is a slice like <code>somelist[1:2]</code> from beginning to end, to create a (shallow) copy of a list. Applying this to your for-loop gives:</p>

<pre><code>alist2 = []
for x in xrange(10):
   alist2.append(alist[x][:])
</code></pre>

<p>This can also be written as a list comprehension:</p>

<pre><code>alist2 = [item[:] for item in alist]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>make a copy of the list when append.</p>

<pre><code>  alist2.append(alist[x][:])
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>If you're already looping over the list anyway then just copying the inner lists as you go is easiest, as per <strong>seanmonstar</strong>'s answer.</p>

<p>If you just want to do a deep copy of the list you could call <code>copy.deepcopy()</code> on it.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Usually you can do something like:</p>

<pre><code>new_list = old_list[:]
</code></pre>

<p>So you could perhaps throw that in your singular for loop?</p>

<pre><code>for x in range(10):
    alist2.append(alist[x][:])
</code></pre>
