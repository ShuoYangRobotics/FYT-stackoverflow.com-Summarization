<h3>Question (ID-2104305):</h3><h2>Python: Elements not in a list</h2><p>So heres my code:</p>

<pre><code>item = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

for item in z:
    if item not in z:
        print item
</code></pre>

<p>Z contains a list of integers. I want to compare item to Z and print out the numbers that are not in Z when compared to item. I can print the elemtens that are in Z when compared not items, but when i try and do the opposite using the code above nothing prints.</p>

<p>Any help?</p>

&gt;&gt; Z = [3,4,5,6]

&gt;&gt; print list(set(items)-set(Z))
[1, 2]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Your code is not doing what I think you think it is doing. The line <code>for item in z:</code> will iterate through <code>z</code>, each time making <code>item</code> equal to one single element of <code>z</code>. The original <code>item</code> list is therefore overwritten before you've done anything with it.</p>

<p>I think you want something like this:</p>

<pre><code>item = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

for element in item:
    if element not in z:
        print element
</code></pre>

<p>But you could easily do this like:</p>

<pre><code>set(item) - set(z)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If you run a loop taking items from z, how do you expect them not to be in z? IMHO it would make more sense comparing items from a different list to z.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><pre><code>list1 = [1,2,3,4]; list2 = [0,3,3,6]

print set(list2) - set(list1)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; item = set([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9])
&gt;&gt;&gt; z = set([2,3,4])
&gt;&gt;&gt; print item - z
set([0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>No, z is undefined. item contains a list of integers.</p>

<p>I think what you're trying to do is this:</p>

<pre><code>#z defined elsewhere
item = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

for i in item:
  if i not in z: print i
</code></pre>

<p>As has been stated in other answers, you may want to try using sets.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Your code is a no-op. By the definition of the loop, "item" has to be in Z. A "For ... in" loop in Python means "Loop though the list called 'z', each time you loop, give me the next item in the list,  and call it 'item'"</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/controlflow.html#for-statements" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/tutorial/controlflow.html#for-statements</a></p>

<p>I think your confusion arises from the fact that you're using the variable name "item" twice, to mean two different things.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>You are reassigning item to the values in z as you iterate through z.  So the first time in your for loop, item = 0, next item = 1, etc...  You are never checking one list against the other.</p>

<p>To do it very explicitly:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; item = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
&gt;&gt;&gt; z = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; for elem in item:
...   if elem not in z:
...     print elem
... 
8
9
</code></pre>
