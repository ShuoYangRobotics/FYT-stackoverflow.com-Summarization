<h3>Question (ID-2083987):</h3><h2>How to retry after exception in python?</h2><p>I have a loop starting with for i in range(0, 100), and inside the loop, normally it would run correctly, but sometimes due to network conditions it would fail. Currently i have it set so that when failed, it would continue in except clause (continue on to the next number for i). I was wondering whether it is possible for me to reassign the same number to i and run through that the failed iteration of loop again.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot!</p>

<pre><code>for i in range(0,100):
    while True:
        try:
            // do stuff
        except:
            continue
        break
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The clearest way would be to explicitly set <code>i</code>. For example:</p>

<pre><code>i = 0
while i &lt; 100:
    try:
        # do stuff
        i += 1
    except MyException:
        continue
</code></pre>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The more "functional" approach without using those ugly while loops:</p>

<pre><code>def tryAgain(retries=0):
    if retries &gt; 10: return
    try:
        # Do stuff
    except:
        retries+=1
        tryAgain(retries)

tryAgain()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>increment your loop variable only when the try clause succeeds</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>There is something similar in the <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonDecoratorLibrary#Retry" rel="nofollow">Python Decorator Library</a>.</p>

<p>Please bear in mind that it does not test for exceptions, but the return value. It retries until the decorated function returns True.</p>

<p>A slightly modified version should do the trick.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I prefer to limit the number of retries, so that if there's a problem with that specific item you will eventually continue onto the next one, thus:</p>

<pre><code>for i in range(100):
  for attempt in range(10):
    try:
      # do thing
    except:
      # perhaps reconnect, etc.
    else:
      break
  else:
    # we failed all the attempts - deal with the consequences.
</code></pre>
