<h3>Question (ID-2586274):</h3><h2>Looking for a Python IDE with good support for libraries (Twisted)</h2><p>I'm looking for a Python IDE that can help me easily locate and manage and use the libraries on my system (Ubuntu).  Specifically Twisted.</p>

<p>Code completion is important including the symbols I import.</p>

<p>(I've so far had a look at PyDev as well as OpenKomodo, but while both offer code completion for default Python concepts, I wasn't able to get either to import Twisted into my project and was thus getting reference errors.)</p>

<p>Usual disclaimer: I don't like EMACS or vi, please, nothing regarding those.</p>

<p>Are you sure you have given PyDev a fair look? It seems to be the most popular Python IDE, and I have always had good experiences with it in the past.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>eclipse + pydev seems to work well for me.</p>

<p>Just remember to right-click on the project and select Properties and make sure that your libraries are on the path. Sometimes this doesn't happen for easy_installed libraries.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I've just downloaded the preview of netbeans and it seems to have done quite well so far.</p>

<p>It has detected inherited methods &amp; properties.  I haven't had to add a single library reference in my project, so this seems to be the most fluid so far.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Like Eclipse is primarily a Java IDE written in Java, you could try <a href="http://eric-ide.python-projects.org/" rel="nofollow">Eric</a> which is a Python IDE written in Python. I have had some issues with it in the past but I really enjoy the ability to stop your code at a breakpoint and have access to the python console to manipulate your data or even to inject new functions. PyDev could really use a <a href="http://pydev.blogspot.com/2008/03/interactive-console-in-pydev.html" rel="nofollow">console</a> like that.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/index.html" rel="nofollow">JetBrains PyCharm</a> is a very interesting newcomer in the Python IDE space. Currently in preview, it already surpasses many of the other IDEs in terms of user-friendliness and features. </p>

<p>It features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Code completion of any imported library</li>
<li>Good support for unit testing</li>
<li>Refactoring</li>
<li>Debugging</li>
<li>Version control integration</li>
</ul>

<p>It's built on the same platform as <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/" rel="nofollow">IntelliJ IDEA</a> which is a generally considered one of the best Java IDEs.</p>

<p>I have been using it myself in the last weeks and enjoyed it very much. It is not very buggy (for a preview release), just incomplete.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>for a small proyects <a href="http://scribes.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">Scribes</a>. Otherwise Eclipse+pydev.</p>
