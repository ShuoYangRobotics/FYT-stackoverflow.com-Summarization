<h3>Question (ID-2223300):</h3><h2>A class subclass of itself. Why mutual subclassing is forbidden?</h2><p>Complex question I assume, but studying OWL opened a new perspective to live, the universe and everything. I'm going philosophical here.</p>

<p>I am trying to achieve a class C which is subclass of B which in turn is subclass of C. Just for fun, you know...</p>

<p>So here it is</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class A(object): pass
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; class B(A): pass
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; class C(B): pass
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; B.__bases__
(&lt;class '__main__.A'&gt;,)
&gt;&gt;&gt; B.__bases__ = (C,)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: a __bases__ item causes an inheritance cycle
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>clearly, python is smart and forbids this. However, in OWL it is possible to define two classes to be mutual subclasses. The question is: what is the mind boggling explanation why this is allowed in OWL (which is not a programming language) and disallowed in programming languages ?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Python doesn't allow it because there is no sensible way to do it. You could invent arbitrary rules about how to handle such a case (and perhaps some languages do), but since there is no actual gain in doing so, Python refuses to guess. Classes are required to have a stable, predictable method resolution order for a number of reasons, and so weird, unpredictable or surprising MROs are not allowed.</p>

<p>That said, there <em>is</em> a special case in Python: <code>type</code> and <code>object</code>. <code>object</code> is an instance of <code>type</code>, and <code>type</code> is a subclass of <code>object</code>. And of course, <code>type</code> is <em>also</em> an instance of <code>type</code> (since it's a subclass of <code>object</code>). This might be why OWL allows it: you need to start a class/metaclass hierarchy in some singularity, if you want everything to be an object and all objects to have a class.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The MRO scheme implemented in Python (as of 2.3) forbids cyclic subclassing. Valid MRO's are guaranteed to satisfy "local precedence" and "monotonicity". Cyclic subclassing would break monotonicity. </p>

<p>This issue is discussed in the section entitled <a href="http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.3/mro/" rel="nofollow">"Bad Method Resolution Orders"</a></p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Part of this "disconnect" is because OWL describes an open world ontology.  An Ontology has little or nothing to do with a program, other than a program can manipulate an ontology.  </p>

<p>Trying to relate OWL concepts to programming languages is like trying to relate A Pianist and A Piano Sonata.  </p>

<p>The sonata doesn't really have a concrete manifestion until someone is playing it -- ideally a Pianist, but not necessarily.  Until it's being played, it's just <em>potential</em> relationships among notes manifested as sounds.  When it's being played, some of actual relationships will be relevant to you, the listener.  Some won't be relevant to the listener.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I think the answer is "When you construct class C ... it must create instance of class B .. which must create instance of class C ... and so on" This will never end. This is forbidden in most languages (in fact i don't know other case).
You can only create an object with a 'reference' to other object that can be initially null.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>For a semantic reasoner, if A is a subclass of B, and B is a subclass of A, then the classes can be considered equivalent. They are not the "same", but from a reasoning perspective, if I can reason an individual is (or is not) a member of the class A, I can reason the individual is (or is not) a member of the class B. The classes A and B are semantically equivalent, which is what you were able to express with OWL.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I'm sure someone can up with an example where this makes sense. However, I guess this restriction is easier and not less powerful.</p>

<p>Eg, Let's say class A holds fields a and b. Class C holds b and c. Then the view on things from C would be: A.a, C.b, C.c and the view from A would be: A.a, A.b, C.c. </p>

<p>Just moving b into a common base class is far easier to understand and implement, though.</p>
