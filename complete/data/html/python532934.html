<h3>Question (ID-532934):</h3><h2>Lightweight pickle for basic types in python?</h2><p>All I want to do is serialize and unserialize tuples of strings or ints.</p>

<p>I looked at pickle.dumps() but the byte overhead is significant. Basically it looks like it takes up about 4x as much space as it needs to. Besides, all I need is basic types and have no need to serialize objects.</p>

<p>marshal is a little better in terms of space but the result is full of nasty \x00 bytes. Ideally I would like the result to be human readable.</p>

<p>I thought of just using repr() and eval(), but is there a simple way I could accomplish this without using eval()?</p>

<p>UPDATE: BTW this is getting stored in a db, not a file. Byte overhead matters because it could make the difference between requiring a TEXT column versus a varchar, and generally data compactness affects all areas of db performance.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Maybe you're not using the right protocol:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import pickle
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = range(1, 100)
&gt;&gt;&gt; len(pickle.dumps(a))
492
&gt;&gt;&gt; len(pickle.dumps(a, pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL))
206
</code></pre>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>personally i would use <a href="http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML" rel="nofollow">yaml</a>.  it's on par with json for encoding size, but it can represent some more complex things (e.g. classes, recursive structures) when necessary. </p>

<pre><code>In [1]: import yaml
In [2]: x = [1, 2, 3, 'pants']
In [3]: print(yaml.dump(x))
[1, 2, 3, pants]

In [4]: y = yaml.load('[1, 2, 3, pants]')
In [5]: y
Out[5]: [1, 2, 3, 'pants']
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>If you need a space efficient solution you can use Google Protocol buffers.</p>

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>"the byte overhead is significant"</p>

<p>Why does this matter?  It does the job.  If you're running low on disk space, I'd be glad to sell you a 1Tb for $500.  </p>

<p>Have you run it?  Is performance a problem?  Can you demonstrate that the performance of serialization is <strong>the</strong> problem?</p>

<p>"I thought of just using repr() and eval(), but is there a simple way I could accomplish this without using eval()?"</p>

<p>Nothing simpler than repr and eval.</p>

<p>What's wrong with eval?</p>

<p>Is is the "someone could insert malicious code into the file where I serialized my lists" issue?</p>

<p>Who -- specifically -- is going to find and edit this file to put in malicious code?  Anything you do to secure this (i.e., encryption) removes "simple" from it.  </p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>There are some persistence builtins mentioned in the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/persistence.html" rel="nofollow">python documentation</a> but I don't think any of these is remarkable smaller in the produced filesize.</p>

<p>You could alway use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/configparser.html" rel="nofollow">configparser</a> but there you only get string, int, float, bool.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Luckily there is solution which uses COMPRESSION, and solves 
the general problem involving any arbitrary Python object 
including new classes. Rather than micro-manage mere 
tuples sometimes it's better to use a DRY tool.<br />
Your code will be more crisp and readily refactored 
in similar future situations. </p>

<p>y_serial.py module :: warehouse Python objects with SQLite</p>

<p>"Serialization + persistance :: in a few lines of code, compress and annotate Python objects into SQLite; then later retrieve them chronologically by keywords without any SQL. Most useful "standard" module for a database to store schema-less data."</p>

<p>[If you are still concerned, why not stick those tuples in 
a dictionary, then apply y_serial to the dictionary. 
Probably any overhead will vanish due to the transparent 
compression in the background by zlib.]</p>

<p>As to readability, the documentation also gives details on 
why cPickle was selected over json.</p>
