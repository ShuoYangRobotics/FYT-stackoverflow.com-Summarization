<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The common reference for Python style is PEP8, see: <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow">http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/</a></p>

<p>To answer your question specifically, this is under "Pet Peeves":</p>

<p>Avoid extraneous whitespace in the following situations:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Immediately inside parentheses, brackets or braces.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Yes: spam(ham[1], {eggs: 2})</p></li>
<li><p>No:  spam( ham[ 1 ], { eggs: 2 } )</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>There's PEP 8 the Python Style Guide:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow">http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/</a></p>

<p>It suggests the former style, but note the introduction carefully.</p>

<p>I find the latter to be visual nails-on-chalkboard, personally.</p>

<p>No space around the inside of function signatures.  Occasionally I put space inside the parens of a function <em>call</em> if the arguments are particularly hairy, but never on the definition.  I don't think any language makes a habit of that, actually.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I don't think you should blindly follow the PEP-8 style, like a vow upon a bible.</p>

<p>The PEP8 is intended for code that goes in the <em>python standard library</em>, i.e. the modules you can import just after you've installed Python, but they have very different development constraints than most of the software I write.</p>

<p>So I tend to think a lot about each "rule" (either from the <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow">PEP8</a>, the <a href="http://www.logilab.org/857" rel="nofollow">pylint</a>/<a href="http://pychecker.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">pychecker</a> ones, or the <a href="http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html" rel="nofollow">Google Style Guide</a>) and see how it can apply to my code -- the pros and cons.</p>

<p>As for your question, people usually don't use spaces inside parentheses, although I've seen it in some code by coworkers that like it, IMHO it detracts a little from readability, but it's a minor issue.</p>
