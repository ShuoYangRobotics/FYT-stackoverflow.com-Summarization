<h3>Question (ID-7957846):</h3><h2>Python RegEx Meaning</h2><p>I'm new to python regular expressions and was wondering if someone could help me out by walking me through what this means (I'll state what I think each bit means here as well).</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<pre><code>RegExp:
r'(^.*def\W*)(\w+)\W*\((.*)\):'

r'...' = python definition of regular expression within the ''
(...) = a regex term
(^. = match the beginning of any character
*def\W* = ???
(\w+) = match any of [a, z] 1 or more times
\W*\ = ? i think its the same as the line above this but from 0+ more times instead of 1 but since it matches the def\W line above (which i dont really know the meaning of) i'm not sure.
((.*)\): = match any additional character within brackets ()
</code></pre>

<p>thanks!</p>

      .*  # match zero or more characters except newline (unless
          # re.DOTALL is set)
      def # match string 'def'
      \W* # match zero or more non-\w chars i.e., [^a-zA-Z0-9_] if no

<hr>

<p><em>PS: I like the effort that you made to try to understand the regex. It will serve you well, much better than people asking what does <code>r'(^.*def\W*)(\w+)\W*\((.*)\):'</code> mean.</em></p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><blockquote>
  <p>r'...' = python definition of regular expression within the ''</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <code>r''</code> syntax has nothing to with regular expressions (or at least, not directly).  The <code>r</code> stands for <code>raw</code> and is simply an indicator to Python that no string interpolation should be performed on the string.</p>

<p>This is often used with regular expressions so that you don't have to escape backslash (<code>\</code>) characters, which would otherwise be eaten by the normal string interpolation mechanism.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(^. = match the beginning of any character</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm not sure what "beginning of any character" means.  The <code>^</code> character matches the beginning of a line.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>def\W</em> = ???</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>def</code> matches the characters <code>def</code>.  For <code>\W</code>, take a look at <code>pydoc re</code>, which describes the regular expression language.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>\W*</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As above.</p>

<p>Other than the above, your interpretation seems largely correct.</p>

<pre><code>==================================

r' tells python this is a raw string so you don't have to double escape all the \

^ match start of string

() in each case this means group this match where each () is a different group

.* match zero or more of any characters

def match the literal 'def'

\W* match zero or more of any non word character

() more grouping of the contained expression

\w+ match one or more of word character

\W* zero or more of any non word character

\( escape the left paren

() more grouping of the contained expression

.* zero of more of any character

\) escape the right paren

: match a single colon literal
</code></pre>

<p>This looks like it is trying to match a python method definition. <a href="http://rubular.com/r/qiz39bPf7F" rel="nofollow">Here is a link to play with this regular expression.</a> Yes it is powered by Ruby, but the syntax is pretty much the same across all languages, I use this site to test regexes for Python, Java and Ruby.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><ul>
<li>r'...' → the preferred way to define the string of a regular expression in Python</li>
<li>(...) → regex term</li>
<li>^ → matches only with the beginning of the string</li>
</ul>

<p>So, in the first pair of parenthesis (^.<em>def\W</em>), firstly it matches with the string.</p>

<ul>
<li>. → matches any character</li>
<li>* → repeat the previous match 0 or more times</li>
</ul>

<p>Then .* will match anything any number of times. The following 'def' is an exact match, that only matches with itself.</p>

<ul>
<li>\W → matches anything that is NOT a letter, nor a number, nor the underscore character.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then \W* will match zero or more of these non-letter-number-underscore characters. The next pair of parenthesis (\w+) you got it right. In the last part \W*\((.*)\): the initial \W* means the same thing as the previous \W* . Next, \( matches with ( , then there is the group (.*) which means, as previously, anything any number of times, followed by \): that matches ): .</p>

<p>An example of string that is matched by this regular expression is:</p>

<pre><code>thing_def = function_name (123 anything in here):
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><ol>
<li><p>Raw string notation (r"text") keeps regular expressions sane. Without it, every backslash ('\') in a regular expression would have to be prefixed with another one to escape it.</p></li>
<li><p>( ) groups a statement, it's treated as ONE thing, so you can do ()? or ()* or ()+ if the things in the brackets need to handled together.</p></li>
<li><p>^ matches it if it's the beginning of the string</p></li>
<li><p>(Dot.) In the default mode, this matches any character except a newline.</p></li>
<li><p>Since it is ".*" the * means match 0 or more matches of the previous thing, which in this case is any character.</p></li>
<li><p>def\W* - lines beginning with the string "def" and then \W matches any non-alphanumeric characters and is equivalent to [^a-zA-Z0-9_]. Since we have the * again, this time it matches 0 or more non-alphanumeric characters.</p></li>
<li><p>(\w+), the + is for 1 or more of the previous, which in this case is \w, equivalent to [a-zA-Z0-9_].</p></li>
</ol>

<p>7.\W*, we know that one already.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>"(" - means just to match "(", differentiate it from () grouping things, same for ")/"</p></li>
<li><p>(.*) - match 0 or more characters inside.</p></li>
<li><p>: - the matched string ends with a colon at the end.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The whole thing seems to be matching a definition of a function in python i.e. "def foo(x):" will be matched. Dealing with regular expressions is hard - using tools such as <a href="http://www.pythonregex.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pythonregex.com/</a> helps me to try out different things. And since RE are slightly different in different languages, it's nice to have tools for those too.</p>
