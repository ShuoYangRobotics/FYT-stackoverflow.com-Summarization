<h3>Question (ID-146557):</h3><h2>Do you use the "global" statement in Python?</h2><p>I was reading a question about the Python <em>global</em> statement ( <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/146359/python-scope">"Python scope"</a> ) and I was remembering about how often I used this statement when I was a Python beginner (I used <em>global</em> a lot) and how, nowadays, years later, I don't use it at all, ever. I even consider it a bit "un-pythonic".<br></p>

<p>Do you use this statement in Python ? Has your usage of it changed with time ?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-12):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I use 'global' in a context such as this:</p>

<pre><code>_cached_result = None
def myComputationallyExpensiveFunction():
    global _cached_result
    if _cached_result:
       return _cached_result

    # ... figure out result

    _cached_result = result
    return result
</code></pre>

<p>I use 'global' because it makes sense and is clear to the reader of the function what is happening. I also know there is this pattern, which is equivalent, but places more cognitive load on the reader:</p>

<pre><code>def myComputationallyExpensiveFunction():
    if myComputationallyExpensiveFunction.cache:
        return myComputationallyExpensiveFunction.cache

    # ... figure out result

    myComputationallyExpensiveFunction.cache = result
    return result
myComputationallyExpensiveFunction.cache = None
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I've never had a legit use for the statement in any production code in my 3+ years of professional use of Python and over five years as a Python hobbyist. Any state I need to change resides in classes or, if there is some "global" state, it sits in some shared structure like a global cache.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>In my view, as soon as you feel the need to use global variables in a python code, it's a great time to stop for a bit and work on refactoring of your code.<br />
Putting the <code>global</code> in the code and delaying the refactoring process might sound promising if your dead-line is close, but, believe me, you're not gonna go back to this and fix unless you really have to - like your code stopped working for some odd reason, you have to debug it, you encounter some of those <code>global</code> variables and all they do is mess things up.</p>

<p>So, honestly, even it's allowed, I would as much as I can avoid using it. Even if it means a simple classes-build around your piece of code.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Objects are the prefered way of having non-local state, so global is rarely needed. I dont think the upcoming nonlocal modifier is going to be widely used either, I think its mostly there to make lispers stop complaining :-)</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Rarely. I've yet to find a use for it at all.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>It can be useful in threads for sharing state (with locking mechanisms around it).</p>

<p>However, I rarely if ever use it.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I avoid it and we even have a <a href="http://www.logilab.org/857" rel="nofollow">pylint</a> rule that forbids it in our production code. I actually believe it shouldn't even exist at all.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>I've used it in quick &amp; dirty, single-use scripts to automate some one-time task. Anything bigger than that, or that needs to be reused, and I'll find a more elegant way.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>I've used it in situations where a function creates or sets variables which will be used globally.  Here are some examples:</p>

<pre><code>discretes = 0
def use_discretes():
    #this global statement is a message to the parser to refer 
    #to the globally defined identifier "discretes"
    global discretes
    if using_real_hardware():
        discretes = 1
...
</code></pre>

<p>or </p>

<pre><code>file1.py:
    def setup():
        global DISP1, DISP2, DISP3
        DISP1 = grab_handle('display_1')
        DISP2 = grab_handle('display_2')
        DISP3 = grab_handle('display_3')
        ...

file2.py:
    import file1

    file1.setup()
    #file1.DISP1 DOES NOT EXIST until after setup() is called.
    file1.DISP1.resolution = 1024, 768
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>Once or twice. But it was always good starting point to refactor.</p>
<br /><b>#10</b><br /><p>If I can avoid it, no. And, to my knowledge, there is always a way to avoid it. But I'm not stating that it's totally useless either</p>
<br /><b>#11</b><br /><p>I use it for global options with command-line scripts and 'optparse':</p>

<p>my main() parses the arguments and passes those to whatever function does the work of the script... but writes the supplied options to a global 'opts' dictionary.</p>

<p>Shell script options often tweak 'leaf' behavior, and it's inconvenient (and unnecessary) to thread the 'opts' dictionary through every argument list. </p>
