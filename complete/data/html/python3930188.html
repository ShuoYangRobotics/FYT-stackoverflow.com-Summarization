<h3>Question (ID-3930188):</h3><h2>python how to convert Nonetype to int or string</h2><p>I've got an Nonetype value x, it's generally a number, but could be None. I want to divide it by a number, but python says</p>

<pre><code>TypeError: int() argument must be a string or a number, not 'NoneType'
</code></pre>

<p>How could I solve that</p>

  <p>Somehow I got an Nonetype value, it supposed to be an int, but it's now a Nonetype object</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, if it's your code, figure out how you're getting <code>None</code> when you expect a number and stop <strong>that</strong> from happening.</p>

<p>If it's someone else's code, find out the conditions under which it gives <code>None</code> and determine a sensible value to use for that.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>That TypeError only appears when you try to pass int() None (which is the only NoneType value, as far as I know).  I would say that your real goal should not be to convert NoneType to int, but to figure out where/why you're getting None instead of a number as expected, and either fix it or handle the None properly.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><pre><code>int(value or 0)
</code></pre>

<p>This will use 0 in the case when you provide any value that Python considers <code>False</code>, such as None, 0, [], "", etc. Since 0 is <code>False</code>, you should only use 0 as the alternative value (otherwise you will find your 0s turning into that value).</p>

<pre><code>int(0 if value is None else value)
</code></pre>

<p>This replaces only <code>None</code> with 0. Since we are testing for <code>None</code> specifically, you can use some other value as the replacement.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>This can happen if you forget to return a value from a function: it then returns None. Look at all places where you are assigning to that variable, and see if one of them is a function call where the function lacks a return statement.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>A common "Pythonic" way to handle this kind of situation is known as <strong>EAFP</strong> for "<em>It's easier to ask forgiveness than permission</em>". Which usually means writing code that assumes everything is fine, but then wrapping it with a <code>try..except</code> block just in case to handle things when it's not. </p>

<p>Here's that coding style applied to your problem:</p>

<pre><code>try:
    my_value = int(my_value)
except TypeError:
    my_value = 0  # or whatever you want to do

answer = my_value / divisor
</code></pre>

<p>Or perhaps the even simpler and slightly faster:</p>

<pre><code>try:
    answer = my_value / divisor
except TypeError:
    answer = 0
</code></pre>

<p>The inverse and more traditional approach is known as <strong>LBYL</strong> which stands for "<em>Look before you leap</em>" is what @Soviut and some of the others have suggested. For additional coverage of this topic see my <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3733992/determine-whether-a-key-is-present-in-a-python-dict/3734681#3734681">answer</a> and associated comments to the question "<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3733992/determine-whether-a-key-is-present-in-a-python-dict-closed">Determine whether a key is present in a Python dict</a>" elsewhere on this site.</p>

<p>One potential problem with <strong>EAFP</strong> is that it can hide the fact that something is wrong with some other part of your code or third-party module you're using, especially when the exceptions frequently occur (and therefore aren't really "exceptional" cases at all).</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You should check to make sure the value is <em>not</em> None before trying to perform any calculations on it:</p>

<pre><code>my_value = None
if my_value is not None:
    print int(my_value) / 2
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <code>my_value</code> was intentionally set to None to prove the code works and that the check is being performed.</p>
