<h3>Question (ID-2111759):</h3><h2>What's the best practice for handling single-value tuples in Python?</h2><p>I am using a 3rd party library function which reads a set of keywords from a file, and is supposed to return a tuple of values. It does this correctly as long as there are at least two keywords. However, in the case where there is only one keyword, it returns a raw string, not a tuple of size one. This is particularly pernicious because when I try to do something like</p>

<pre><code>for keyword in library.get_keywords():
    # Do something with keyword
</code></pre>

<p>, in the case of the single keyword, the <code>for</code> iterates over each character of the string in succession, which throws no exception, at run-time or otherwise, but is nevertheless completely useless to me.</p>

<p>My question is two-fold:</p>

<p>Clearly this is a bug in the library, which is out of my control. How can I best work around it?</p>

<p>Secondly, in general, if I am writing a function that returns a tuple, what is the best practice for ensuring tuples with one element are correctly generated? For example, if I have</p>

<pre><code>def tuple_maker(values):
    my_tuple = (values)
    return my_tuple

for val in tuple_maker("a string"):
    print "Value was", val

for val in tuple_maker(["str1", "str2", "str3"]):
    print "Value was", val
</code></pre>

<p>I get</p>

<pre><code>Value was a
Value was  
Value was s
Value was t
Value was r
Value was i
Value was n
Value was g
Value was str1
Value was str2
Value was str3
</code></pre>

<p>What is the best way to modify the function <code>my_tuple</code> to actually return a tuple when there is only a single element? Do I explicitly need to check whether the size is 1, and create the tuple seperately, using the <code>(value,)</code> syntax? This implies that any function that has the possibility of returning a single-valued tuple must do this, which seems hacky and repetitive. </p>

<p>Is there some elegant general solution to this problem?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You need to somehow test for the type, if it's a string or a tuple. I'd do it like this:</p>

<pre><code>keywords = library.get_keywords()
if not isinstance(keywords, tuple):
    keywords = (keywords,) # Note the comma
for keyword in keywords:
    do_your_thang(keyword)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>For your first problem, I'm not really sure if this is the best answer, but I think you need to check yourself whether the returned value is a string or tuple and act accordingly. </p>

<p>As for your second problem, any variable can be turned into a single valued tuple by placing a <code>,</code> next to it:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x='abc'
&gt;&gt;&gt; x
'abc'
&gt;&gt;&gt; tpl=x,
&gt;&gt;&gt; tpl
('abc',)
</code></pre>

<p>Putting these two ideas together:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def make_tuple(k):
...     if isinstance(k,tuple):
...             return k
...     else:
...             return k,
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; make_tuple('xyz')
('xyz',)
&gt;&gt;&gt; make_tuple(('abc','xyz'))
('abc', 'xyz')
</code></pre>

<p>Note: IMHO it is generally a bad idea to use isinstance, or any other form of logic that needs to check the type of an object at runtime. But for this problem I don't see any way around it. </p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>There's always monkeypatching!</p>

<pre><code># Store a reference to the real library function
really_get_keywords = library.get_keywords

# Define out patched version of the function, which uses the real
# version above, adjusting its return value as necessary
def patched_get_keywords():
    """Make sure we always get a tuple of keywords."""
    result = really_get_keywords()
    return result if isinstance(result, tuple) else (result,)

# Install the patched version
library.get_keywords = patched_get_keywords
</code></pre>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This code might burn down your house and sleep with your wife.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Rather than checking for a length of 1, I'd use the isinstance built-in instead.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance('a_str', tuple)
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance(('str1', 'str2', 'str3'), tuple)
True
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Your <code>tuple_maker</code> doesn't do what you think it does. An equivalent definition of <code>tuple maker</code> to yours is</p>

<pre><code>def tuple_maker(input):
    return input
</code></pre>

<p>What you're seeing is that <code>tuple_maker("a string")</code> returns a string, while <code>tuple_maker(["str1","str2","str3"])</code> returns a list of strings; neither return a tuple!</p>

<p>Tuples in Python are defined by the presence of commas, not brackets. Thus <code>(1,2)</code> is a tuple containing the values <code>1</code> and <code>2</code>, while <code>(1,)</code> is a tuple containing the single value <code>1</code>.</p>

<p>To convert a value to a tuple, as others have pointed out, use <code>tuple</code>.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; tuple([1])
(1,)
&gt;&gt;&gt; tuple([1,2])
(1,2)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Is it absolutely necessary that it returns tuples, or will any iterable do?</p>

<pre><code>import collections
def iterate(keywords):
    if not isinstance(keywords, collections.Iterable):
        yield keywords
    else:
        for keyword in keywords:
            yield keyword


for keyword in iterate(library.get_keywords()):
    print keyword
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>for your first problem you could check if the return value is tuple using </p>

<pre><code>type(r) is tuple
#alternative
isinstance(r, tuple)
# one-liner
def as_tuple(r): return [ tuple([r]), r ][type(r) is tuple]
</code></pre>

<p>the second thing i like to use <code>tuple([1])</code>. think it is a matter of taste. could probably also write a wrapper, for example <code>def tuple1(s): return tuple([s])</code></p>
