<h3>Question (ID-6924520):</h3><h2>Binary negation in python</h2><p>I can't seem to find logical negation of integers as an operator anywhere in Python.</p>

<p>Currently I'm using this:</p>

<pre><code>def not_(x):
    assert x in (0, 1)
    return abs(1-x)
</code></pre>

<p>But I feel a little stupid.  Isn't there a built-in operator for this?  The logical negation (<code>not</code>) returns a Boolean -- that's not really what I want.  Is there a different operator, or a way to make <code>not</code> return an integer, or am I stuck with this dodgy workaround?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Did you mean:</p>

<pre><code>int(not(x))
</code></pre>

<p>? Assuming that any non-zero integer value is true and 0 is false you'll always get integer 0 or 1 as a result.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You can use:</p>

<pre><code>int(not x)
</code></pre>

<p>to convert the boolean to 0 or 1.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If you are looking for Bitwise Not, then <code>~</code> is what you are looking for. However, it works in the two's complement form.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>This will raise a KeyError if x is not in (0,1)</p>

<pre><code>def not_(x):
    return {1:0,0:1}[x]
</code></pre>

<p>The tuple version would also accept -1 if you don't add a check for it, but is probably faster</p>

<pre><code>def not_(x):
    return (1,0)[x]

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You can use <code>not</code> but then convert result to integer.</p>

<pre><code>int(False)
0
int(True)
1
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I think Your approach is very good for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>It is fast, clear and understandable</li>
<li>It does error-checking</li>
</ol>

<p>I assume that there cannot be such operator defined on the integers, because of the following problem: what to return if given value is not 0 or 1? Throw exception? Assume positive integers to mean 1? But negative integers?</p>

<p>Your approach defines concrete behaviour - accept only 0 or 1.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>So what you expect is to get 1 when input is 0, and 0 and when input is 1? Then XOR is your friend, you need to XOR your value with 1:</p>

<pre><code>In [15]: negate = lambda x: x^1

In [16]: negate(0)
Out[16]: 1

In [17]: negate(1)
Out[17]: 0
</code></pre>
