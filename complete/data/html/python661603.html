<h3>Question (ID-661603):</h3><h2>How do I know if a generator is empty from the start?</h2><p>Is there a simple way of testing if the generator has no items, like peek, hasNext, isEmpty, something along those lines?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The simple answer to your question: no, there is no simple way.  There are a whole lot of work-arounds.</p>

<p>There really shouldn't be a simple way, because of what generators are: a way to output a sequence of values <em>without holding the sequence in memory</em>.  So there's no backward traversal.</p>

<p>You could write a has_next function or maybe even slap it on to a generator as a method with a fancy decorator if you wanted to.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Here is a recipe for an iterator wrapper, it probably allows to do what you want:</p>

<p>Note: I have not tested if it works or not.
Nor am I sure that the functionality is useful.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Suggestion:</p>

<pre><code>def peek(iterable):
    try:
        first, rest = next(iterable)
    except StopIteration:
        return None
    return first, itertools.chain([first], rest)
</code></pre>

<p>Usage:</p>

<pre><code>res = peek(mysequence)
if res is None:
    # sequence is empty.  Do stuff.
else:
    first, mysequence = res
    # Do something with first, maybe?
    # Then iterate over the sequence:
    for element in mysequence:
        # etc.
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I hate to offer a second solution, especially one that I would not use myself, but, if you absolutely <em>had</em> to do this and to not consume the generator, as in other answers:</p>

<pre><code>def do_something_with_item(item):
    print item

empty_marker = object()

try:
     first_item = my_generator.next()     
except StopIteration:
     print 'The generator was empty'
     first_item = empty_marker

if first_item is not empty_marker:
    do_something_with_item(first_item)
    for item in my_generator:
        do_something_with_item(item)
</code></pre>

<p>Now I really don't like this solution, because I believe that this is not how generators are to be used.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Sorry for the obvious approach, but the best way would be to do:</p>

<pre><code>for item in my_generator:
     print item
</code></pre>

<p>Now you have detected that the generator is empty while you are using it. Of course, item will never be displayed if the generator is empty.</p>

<p>This may not exactly fit in with your code, but this is what the idiom of the generator is for: iterating, so perhaps you might change your approach slightly, or not use generators at all.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>The best approach, IMHO, would be to avoid a special test. Most times, use of a generator <em>is</em> the test:</p>

<pre><code>thing_generated = False

# Nothing is lost here. if nothing is generated, 
# the for block is not executed. Often, that's the only check
# you need to do
for thing in my_generator():
    thing_generated = True
    print "I've generated something!"
</code></pre>

<p>If that's not good enough, you can still perform an explicit test. At this point, <code>thing</code> will contain the last value generated. If nothing was generated, it will be undefined - unless you've already defined the variable. You could check the value of <code>thing</code>, but that's a bit unreliable. Instead, just set a flag within the block and check it afterward:</p>

<pre><code>if not thing_generated:
    print "Avast, ye scurvy dog!"
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; gen = (i for i in [])
&gt;&gt;&gt; next(gen)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;pyshell#43&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    next(gen)
StopIteration
</code></pre>

<p>At the end of generator <code>StopIteration</code> is raised, since in your case end is reached immediately, exception is raised. <strong>But normally you shouldn't check for existence of next value.</strong></p>

<p>another thing you can do is:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; gen = (i for i in [])
&gt;&gt;&gt; if not list(gen):
    print('empty generator')
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>If you need to know <em>before</em> you use the generator, then no, there is no simple way.  If you can wait until <em>after</em> you have used the generator, there is a simple way:</p>

<pre><code>was_empty = True

for some_item in some_generator:
    was_empty = False
    do_something_with(some_item)

if was_empty:
    handle_already_empty_generator_case()
</code></pre>
