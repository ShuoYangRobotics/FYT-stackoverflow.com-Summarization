<h3>Question (ID-4027586):</h3><h2>Is it ok to skip "return None"?</h2><p>I wonder if it is bad manner to skip <code>return None</code>, when it is not needed.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>def foo1(x):
    if [some condition]:
        return Baz(x)
    else:
        return None

def foo2(x):
    if [some condition]:
        return Baz(x)

bar1 = foo1(x)
bar2 = foo2(x)
</code></pre>

<p>In both cases, when condition is false, function will return with <code>None</code>.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Like you said, <code>return None</code> is (almost) never needed.</p>

<p>But you should consider that the <em>intention</em> of your code is much clearer with an explicit <code>return None</code>. Remember: a piece of code also needs to be readable by human-beings, and being explicit usually helps.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>To expound on what others have said, I use a <code>return None</code> if the function is supposed to return a value.  In Python, all function return a value, but often we write functions that only ever return None, because their return value is ignored.  In some languages, these would be called procedures.</p>

<p>So if a function is supposed to return a value, then I make sure all code paths have a return, and that the return has a value, even if it is None.</p>

<p>If a function "doesn't" return a value, that is, if it is never called by someone using its return value, then it's ok to end without a return, and if I need to return early, I use the bare form, <code>return</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Yes and No.</p>

<p><strong>In the simplest case, it is ok to skip</strong> "return None" because it returns None in only single negative condition. </p>

<p>But if there are nested condition evaluation and multiple scenarios where a function could return None. I tend to include them as <strong>visual documentation of the scenarios</strong>.</p>

  <p>return or return None </p>

<p><strong>I prefer "return None" to bare "return"</strong> as It is explicit and later, no one will be in doubt if the return meant returning None or was it an error as something was missing.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Yes, if you do not return any value from a Python function, it returns None. So, whether to explicitly return None is a stylistic decision.</p>

<p>Personally, I prefer to always return a value for clarity.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>The more I think about it, the less I think the case you describe shows good practice. It forces the client to discriminate, so client code would almost always look like:</p>

<pre><code>b = foo1(123)
if b is not None:
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>You couldn't even write:</p>

<pre><code>if b:
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>since, if <code>Baz.__nonzero__</code> is overwritten, b could evaluate to False, even if it's not None. It would be better to have a <code>Null-Baz</code> instance (AKA <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Object_pattern" rel="nofollow">Null Object</a>), e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>class Baz(object):
    def some_method(self):
        """some action:"""
        ...
    ...

class BazNull(Baz):
    def some_method(self):
        """nothing happens here"""
    ...

Baz.Null = BazNull()

...

def foo1(x):
    if some_condition:
        return Baz(x)
    else:
        return Baz.Null

...

b = foo1(123)
b.some_method()
</code></pre>

<p>The point is: help the client (who might be yourself!) to keep <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity" rel="nofollow">Cyclomatic Complexity</a> low. The fewer branches, the better. </p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><pre><code>def foo1(x):
    try:
        return Baz(x)
    except:
        raise ValueError('Incorrect value fo Bac')
</code></pre>

<p>or </p>

<pre><code>def foo3(x):
    return Baz(x) if &lt;condition&gt; else False
</code></pre>

<p>I do not believe in half defined function, but this False can be usefull in search type failure pruning.</p>
