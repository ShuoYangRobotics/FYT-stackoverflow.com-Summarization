<h3>Question (ID-1219548):</h3><h2>java and python equivalent of php's foreach($array as $key => $value)</h2><p>EDIT: Amazingly, newacct's answer has accumulated 12 points in the four hours since I posted my question. This, despite its being incorrect. As alternatives to php's associative array, newacct offers Java's HashMap and Python's dictionary, neither of which preserves key order.</p>

<p>cmcg provided a correct answer for the Java version. That is, to use a LinkedHashMap to preserve key order. Milhous suggested a TreeMap, but Piligrim pointed out that a TreeMap  sorts elements by key, while LinkedHashMap preserves original order, which was the intent.</p>

<p>Alexander Ljungberg first indicated that an ordered dictionary was not currently available for Python. Daniel Pryden then provided a simple and straightforward alternative structure, a list of two-tuples.</p>

<p>In the hope that my beginner's Python syntax is correct,</p>

<pre><code># a list of two-tuples
stateList = [('ALABAMA', 'AL'), ('ALASKA', 'AK'), ('WISCONSIN', 'WI'), ('WYOMING', 'WY')]

for name, abbreviation in stateList:
    print name, abbreviation
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>ALABAMA AL
ALASKA AK
WISCONSIN WI
WYOMING WY
</code></pre>

<p>Which is exactly what was required.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who contributed. It's been educational.</p>

<p>In php one can handle a list of state names and their abbreviations with an associative array like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
    $stateArray = array (
        "ALABAMA"=&gt;"AL",
        "ALASKA"=&gt;"AK",
        // etc...
        "WYOMING"=&gt;"WY");

    foreach ($stateArray as $stateName =&gt; $stateAbbreviation)
    {
        print "The abbreviation for $stateName is $stateAbbreviation.\n\n";
    }
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Output ( * with key order preserved * ):</p>

<p>The abbreviation for ALABAMA is AL.</p>

<p>The abbreviation for ALASKA is AK.</p>

<p>The abbreviation for WYOMING is WY.</p>

<p>EDIT: Note that the order of array elements is preserved in the output of the php version. The Java implementation, using a HashMap, does not guarantee the order of elements. Nor, in fact, does the dictionary in Python.</p>

<p>How is this done in java and python? I only find approaches that supply the value, given the key, like python's:</p>

<pre><code>stateDict = {
    "ALASKA" : "AK",
    "WYOMING" : "WY"
    }

for key in stateDict:
    value = stateDict[key]
</code></pre>

<p>Many thanks.</p>

<pre><code>for key, value in stateDict.items(): # .iteritems() in Python 2.x
    print "The abbreviation for %s is %s." % (key, value)
</code></pre>

<p>in Java:</p>

<pre><code>Map&lt;String,String&gt; stateDict;

for (Map.Entry&lt;String,String&gt; e : stateDict.entrySet())
    System.out.println("The abbreviation for " + e.getKey() + " is " + e.getValue() + ".");
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>in java for associative array use Map</p>

<pre><code>import java.util.*;

class Foo
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
    	Map&lt;String, String&gt; stateMap = new HashMap&lt;String, String&gt;();
    	stateMap.put("ALABAMA", "AL");
    	stateMap.put("ALASKA", "AK");
    	// ...
    	stateMap.put("WYOMING", "WY");

    	for (Map.Entry&lt;String, String&gt; state : stateMap.entrySet()) {
    		 System.out.printf(
    			"The abbreviation for %s is %s%n",
    			state.getKey(),
    			state.getValue()
    		);
    	}
    }
}
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Also, to maintain insertion order, you can use a LinkedHashMap instead of a HashMap.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>In python an <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0372/" rel="nofollow">ordered dictionary</a> is available in Python 2.7 (not yet released) and Python 3.1. It's called OrderedDict.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Another way of doing it in Java. Although a better way has already been posted, this one's syntactically closer to your php code.</p>

<pre><code>for (String x:stateDict.keySet()){
		System.out.printf("The abbreviation for %s is %s\n",x,stateDict.get(x));
	}
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>This is the modified code from o948 where you use a TreeMap instead of a HashMap.  The Tree map will preserve the ordering of the keys by the key.</p>

<pre><code>import java.util.*;

class Foo
{
 public static void main(String[] args)
 {
    Map&lt;String, String&gt; stateMap = new TreeMap&lt;String, String&gt;();
    stateMap.put("ALABAMA", "AL");
    stateMap.put("ALASKA", "AK");
    // ...
    stateMap.put("WYOMING", "WY");

    for (Map.Entry&lt;String, String&gt; state : stateMap.entrySet()) {
             System.out.printf(
                    "The abbreviation for %s is %s%n",
                    state.getKey(),
                    state.getValue()
            );
      }
    }
 }
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Along the lines of Alexander's answer...</p>

<p>The native python dictionary doesn't maintain ordering for maximum efficiency of its primary use: an unordered mapping of keys to values.</p>

<p>I can think of two workarounds:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>look at the source code of OrderedDict and include it in your own program.</p></li>
<li><p>make a list that holds the keys in order:</p>

<pre><code>states = ['Alabamba', 'Alaska', ...]  
statesd = {'Alabamba':'AL', 'Alaska':'AK', ...}
for k in states:
    print "The abbreviation for %s is %s." % (k, statesd[k])
</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>TreeMap is not an answer to your question because it sorts elements by key, while LinkedHashMap preserves original order. However, TreeMap is more suitable for the dictionary because of sorting.</p>
