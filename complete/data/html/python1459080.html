<h3>Question (ID-1459080):</h3><h2>How can I protect myself from a zip bomb?</h2><p>I just read about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip%5Fbomb" rel="nofollow">zip bombs</a>, i.e. zip files that contain very large amount of highly compressible data (00000000000000000...).</p>

<p>When opened they fill the server's disk.</p>

<p>How can I detect a zip file is a zip bomb <strong>before</strong> unzipping it?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> Can you tell me how is this done in Python or Java?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Try this in Python:</p>

<pre><code>import zipfile
z = zipfile.ZipFile('c:/a_zip_file')
print 'total files size=', sum(e.file_size for e in z.infolist())
z.close()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Zip is, erm, an "interesting" format. A robust solution is to stream the data out, and stop when you have had enough. In Java, use <code>ZipInputStream</code> rather than <code>ZipFile</code>. The latter also requires you to store the data in a temporary file, which is also not the greatest of ideas.</p>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Reading over the description on Wikipedia - </p>

<p>Deny any compressed files that contain compressed files.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/zip/ZipFile.html#entries%28%29">ZipFile.entries()</a> to retrieve a list of files, then <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/zip/ZipEntry.html#getName%28%29">ZipEntry.getName()</a> to find the file extension.<br/>
Deny any compressed files that contain files over a set size, or the size can not be determined at startup.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While iterating over the files use <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/zip/ZipEntry.html#getSize%28%29">ZipEntry.getSize()</a> to retrieve the file size.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>If the ZIP decompressor you use can provide the data on original and compressed size you can use that data. Otherwise start unzipping and monitor the output size - if it grows too much cut it loose.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Don't allow the upload process to write enough data to fill up the disk, ie solve the problem, not just one possible cause of the problem.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Make sure you are not using your system drive for temp storage. I am not sure if a virusscanner will check it if it encounters it. </p>

<p>Also you can look at the information inside the zip file and retrieve a list of the content. How to do this depends on the utility used to extract the file, so you need to provide more information here</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Download files only from trusted sources.</p>
