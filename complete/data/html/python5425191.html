<h3>Question (ID-5425191):</h3><h2>How can you automate terminal commands?</h2><p>I'm tired of doing this.</p>

<pre><code>ssh me@somehost.com
input my password
sudo su - someuser
input my password
cd /some/working/directory
&lt;run some commands&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Is there anyway to automate this? Do I need a special shell? or a shell emulator? can I programmatically drive the shell up to certain point then <strong>run manual commands on it</strong>?</p>

<p>Bonus points of it's programmed in python for extra hacking goodness</p>

<p>edit: All the answers below focus on the "full automation" part of the question: Where the hard part is what I highlighted above. Here is another example to see if I can capture the essence. </p>

<pre><code>ssh me@somehost.com
&lt;get a shell because keys are setup&gt;
sudo su - user_that_deploys_the_app
&lt;input password, because we don't want to give passwordless sudo to developers&gt;
cd env; source bin/activate
cd /path/where/ur/app/is/staging
&lt;edit some files, restart the server, edit some more, check the logs, etc.&gt;
exit the term
</code></pre>

Then you can simply use <code>ssh</code> and a bash script to execute a series of commands in an automated fashion.</p>

<p>You <strong>could</strong> use Python here, but if you are executing a series of shell commands, it's probably a better idea to use a shell script, as that's precisely what they do.</p>

<p>Alternately, look into <a href="http://fabfile.org" rel="nofollow">Fabric</a> for your automation needs.  It's Python-based, and your "recipes" are written in Python.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I'm not quite sure what you're asking, but what you're probably asking about is getting SSH working in password-less mode using public keys. The general idea is you generate an SSH keypair:</p>

<pre><code>ssh-keygen -t rsa
</code></pre>

<p>which gives you <code>id_rsa</code> and <code>id_rsa.pub</code>. You append the contents of <code>id_rsa.pub</code> to the <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> file of your target user, and SSH from that point on will not ask for credentials. In your example, this will work out to:</p>

<p><strong>Only once</strong></p>

<pre><code># On your source machine
ssh-keygen -t rsa
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
# Copy this to clip board

# On somehost.com
su - someuser
# edit ~/.ssh/authorized_keys and paste what you had copied from previous step
</code></pre>

<p>From now on, you can now just run</p>

<pre><code>ssh someuser@somehost.com "sh -c 'cd /some/dir; command.sh'"
</code></pre>

<p>and not be prompted for credentials.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>fabric is a fine choice, as others have pointed out.  there is also <a href="http://www.noah.org/wiki/pexpect" rel="nofollow">pexpect</a> which might be more what you're looking for.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You can play with <code>autoexpect</code>. It creates <code>expect</code> script (script language intended to handle interaction with user). Run</p>

<pre><code>autoexpect ssh me@somehost.com
</code></pre>

<p>followed by rest of commands. Script <code>script.exp</code> will be created. 
Please note, that exact results of input and output will be recorded by the script. If output may differ from execution to execution, you'll need to modify a bit generated script.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>As Daniel pointed out you need to have a secure way of doing ssh and sudo on the boxes. Those items are universal to dealing with linux/unix boxes. Once you've tackled that you can use <a href="http://fabfile.org" rel="nofollow">fabric</a>. It's a python based tool to do automation.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You can set stuff up in your <code>~/.ssh/config</code>
For example:</p>

<pre><code>Host somehost
    User test
</code></pre>

<p>See ssh_config(5) for more info.</p>

<p>Next, you can generate a SSH key using ssh-keygen(1), run ssh-agent(1), and use that for authentication.</p>

<p>If you want to run a command on a remote machine, you can just use something like:</p>

<p><code>$ ssh somehost "sh myscript.sh ${myparameter}"</code>.</p>

<p>I hope this at least points you in the right direction :)</p>

<p>If you <em>need</em> sudo access, then there are obvious potential security issues though ... You can use <code>ChrootDirectory</code> on a per user basis inside a <code>Match</code> block though. See sshd_config(5) for info.</p>
