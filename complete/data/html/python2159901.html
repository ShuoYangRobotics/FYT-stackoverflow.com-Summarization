<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I use Eclipse/PyDev for wxPython development. I've been very satisfied with Eclipse for Python development productivity. It does have support for autocompletion for wxPython.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Eclipse+PyDev with the install directory for wxPython added to the PythonPath has fully functioning autocomplete.

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>try use <em>brain</em> to autocomplete... :)</p>

<p>just joking. when I coding in in PyQt4, I open qt-assistant and search the manual,
and wrap myclass like : MyButton = QPusuButton</p>

<p>I think it is impossible to use autocomplete in python,
because only in runtime the computer know what happens.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Whatever the default windows IDE for Python is can autocomplete, with code not from the standard library.</p>
