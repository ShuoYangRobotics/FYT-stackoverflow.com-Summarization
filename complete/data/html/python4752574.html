<h3>Question (ID-4752574):</h3><h2>Python as a web scripting language?</h2><p>I've recently been developing with Python, and I absolutely love it. It's a <em>huge</em> step up from PHP as a quick scripting language (imagine, no crazy function names!), and I would love to be able to use it as a web development language.</p>

<p>I've heard about Django, but I want something a bit more simple.</p>

<p>I run Lighttpd, and I've already gotten a Python script to work, but I can't pass arguments to it via the URL, like <code>http://localhost/index.py?foo=bar</code>. Is there a function/library that allows this?</p>

<p>I could be going at this all wrong, so please tell me if I am. But I absolutely <em>hate</em> PHP, now that I've seen Python. ;)</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>If you want a dead simple but powerful framework, try <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>.</p>

<p>(Then learn some <a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a>, and things will suddenly become even easier.)</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Assuming you're using a CGI interface, the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/cgi.html" rel="nofollow">cgi</a> module.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You can check out the <a href="http://github.com/agiliq/so-starving" rel="nofollow">so-starving</a> project to see a simple application written in a variety of different python web frameworks, and choose one that you agree with!</p>

<p>Any of the available Python frameworks allow you to custom-map your URL's to specific python functions. The above URL would look more like <strong>.../blog/foo/bar</strong> and your app would know what to do with the extra bits.</p>

<p>On a personal note, I second the recommendation for Flask - It's a great microframework for beginners as well as useful to pros working on small projects.</p>

<p>I've also fallen in love with the framework Pyramid, which is a bit more complex but suited very well for larger applications.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I can recommend Django very highly. It's not that complicated. What I think you're looking for at the moment, however, is <a href="http://webpy.org/" rel="nofollow">http://webpy.org/</a> .</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You can use CGI, but it's somewhat counterintuitive and pretty painful to work with (compared to the alternatives). If you'd like to ease that pain, I'd suggest using a framework. There are quite a few frameworks out there, the most popular being Django, Pylons, and a few others. You can see a full list <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/WebFrameworks" rel="nofollow">here</a> and decide for yourself.</p>

<p>If you're looking for something full-stack, Django. If you want something small, Flask, web2py, and a number of others work.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You can use WSGI which is a standard interface between web servers and Python web applications or frameworks. This <a href="http://webpython.codepoint.net/wsgi_tutorial" rel="nofollow">tutorial</a> is really helpful for getting started with WSGI. It includes parsing GET and POST requests (as you mentioned in the question).</p>
