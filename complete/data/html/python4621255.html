<h3>Question (ID-4621255):</h3><h2>How do I run a python program in the Command Prompt in Windows 7?</h2><p>I'm [relatively] new to python. I'm trying to figure out how to run python programs with the Command Prompt on Windows 7. (I should have figured this out by now...)</p>

<p>When I typed "python" into the command prompt, I got the following error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
  operable program or batch file.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first place I found when looking for help was this site: <a href="http://docs.python.org/faq/windows.html#how-do-i-run-a-python-program-under-windows" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/faq/windows.html#how-do-i-run-a-python-program-under-windows</a>.</p>

<p>It was somewhat helpful, but the tutorial was written for Windows 2000 and older, so it was minimally helpful for my Windows 7 machine. I attempted the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For older versions of Windows the easiest way to do this is to edit the C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT >file. You would want to add a line like the following to AUTOEXEC.BAT:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This file did not exist on my machine (unless I'm mistaken). </p>

<p>Next, I tried this: (here: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1522564/how-do-i-run-a-python-program">How do I run a Python program?</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Putting Python In Your Path</p>
  
  <p>Windows</p>
  
  <p>In order to run programs, your operating system looks in various places, and tries to match the name of the program / command you typed with some programs along the way.</p>
  
  <p>In windows:</p>
  
  <p>control panel > system > advanced > |Environmental Variables| > system variables -> Path</p>
  
  <p>this needs to include: C:\Python26; (or equivalent). If you put it at the front, it will be the first place looked. You can also add it at the end, which is possibly saner.</p>
  
  <p>Then restart your prompt, and try typing 'python'. If it all worked, you should get a ">>>" prompt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was relevant enough for Windows 7, and I made my way to the System Variables. I added a variable "python"  with the value "C:\Python27"</p>

<p>I continued to get the error, even after restarting my computer.</p>

<p>Anyone know how to fix this?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You need to add <code>C:\Python27</code> to your PATH variable, not a new variable named "python".</p>

<p>Find the PATH variable (using the method you posted), then modify the system PATH variable by adding a <code>;</code> (which is the delimiter) and the path <code>C:\Python27</code> at the end.</p>

<p>The PATH variable lists all the locations that Windows (and <code>cmd.exe</code>) will check when given the name of a command, e.g. "python" (it also uses the PATHEXT variable for a list of executable file extensions to try).</p>

<p>Note that after changing this variable, there is no need to restart Windows, but only new instances of <code>cmd.exe</code> will have the updated PATH. You can type <code>set PATH</code> at the command prompt to see what the current value is.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Assuming you have Python2.7 installed </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Goto the Start Menu</p></li>
<li><p>Right Click "Computer"</p></li>
<li><p>Select "Properties"</p></li>
<li><p>A dialog should pop up with a link on the left called "Advanced system settings". Click it.</p></li>
<li><p>In the System Properties dialog, click the button called "Environment Variables".</p></li>
<li><p>In the Environment Variables dialog look for "Path" under the System Variables window.</p></li>
<li><p>Add ";C:\Python27" to the end of it. The semicolon is the path separator on windows.</p></li>
<li><p>Click Ok and close the dialogs. </p></li>
<li><p>Now open up a new command prompt and type "python"</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It should work. </p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You don't add any variables to the System Variables.  You take the existing 'Path' system variable, and modify it by adding a semi-colon after, then c:\Python27</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You have to put the python path in the <code>PATH</code> variable.</p>

<p>In the System Variables section, you should have User Variables and System Variables. Search for the <code>PATH</code> variable and edit its value, adding at the end <code>;C:\python27</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>;</code> is to tell the variable to add a new path to this value, and the rest, is just to tell which path that is.</p>

<p>On the other hand, you can use <code>;%python%</code> to add the variable you created.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Modify the <code>PATH</code> variable too and append <code>;%python%</code> otherwise the executable can not be found.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You need to edit the environment variable named <code>PATH</code>, and add <code>;c:\python27</code> to the end of that. The semicolon separates one pathname from another (you will already have several things in your <code>PATH</code>).</p>

<p>Alternately, you can just type</p>

<pre><code>c:\python27\python
</code></pre>

<p>at the command prompt without having to modify any environment variables at all.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>On Windows you use <code>C:\Python27\python.exe</code> instead of <code>python</code>.</p>

<p>If you add <code>C:\Python27</code> to your path, you can shorten it to just <code>python.exe</code>, but you do not need to do this.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>First install the Python into your windows by using this <a href="http://www.python.org/getit/windows/" rel="nofollow">url</a>
and then add path variable as </p>

<pre><code>c:\python27
</code></pre>
