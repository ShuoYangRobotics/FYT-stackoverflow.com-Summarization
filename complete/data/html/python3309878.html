<h3>Question (ID-3309878):</h3><h2>What is best way for interactive debug in python?</h2><p>I want to utilize introspection capability of python for debugging/development, but cannot find appropriate tool for this.</p>

<p>I need to enter into shell (IPython for example) at specific position or at specific event (like exception), with locals and globals of shell being set to the frame's ones.</p>

<p>My own quick hack to illustrate it:</p>

<pre><code>import inspect
from IPython.Shell import IPShellEmbed
def run_debug():
    stack = inspect.stack()
    frame = stack[1][0]
    loc = frame.f_locals
    glob = frame.f_globals
    shell = IPShellEmbed()
    shell(local_ns=loc, global_ns=glob)
</code></pre>

<p>With according run_debug() call from 'breakpoint' or try/except. But, obviously, this needs alot of polishing, esp to work with threaded apps properly. </p>

<p>winpdb has breakpoints with console, but I found no way to quickly run proper python shell from it, and eval()/exec() are not very handy for long debug.</p>

<p>Of course if you're just worried about changing values you can always just use <code>raw_input()</code> - but that may not be advanced enough for your needs.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I think the question <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1395913/python-drop-into-repl">Python Drop into REPL</a> is similar to what you want to do, take a look (esp. the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1395913/python-drop-into-repl/1396386#1396386">answer suggesting module 'code'</a>) ...</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>See <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/google-appengine-python/browse_thread/thread/d39bd4e6c72dc65?pli=1" rel="nofollow">this link</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Similar to what you're already doing, there's <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ipdb" rel="nofollow">ipdb</a>.  Effectively, it's pdb with ipython's shell (i.e. tab completion, all the various magic functions, etc).</p>

<p>It's actually doing exactly what the little code snipped you posted in your question does, but wraps it into a simple "ipdb.set_trace()" call.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/pyscripter/" rel="nofollow">PyScripter</a> (FOSS) has a pretty good debugger built in.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>If you run your code from ipython and hit an exception, you can call %debug afterwards to drop into a pdb at the exception.  This should give you what you want.  Or if you run ipython -pdb, you will automatically be dropped into pdb when an uncaught exception occurs.</p>
