<h3>Question (ID-4855997):</h3><h2>When will Django support Python 3.x?</h2><p>I understand Django can only be run on Python 2.7 or below.  When will it run on Python 3.1 or above?  I see that Django 1.3 is coming out, does that support Python 3.x?</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>loewis has been working on a port of django to python 3 for a while.</p>

<p>On Sept 9th, 2011 jacob (on of the core devs) started the py3k feature branch and pulled these changes in.</p>

<p>AFAIK, no official release number or date has been set for when django will support python 3. More info on this thread:</p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>It might run on Python 3 by the end of summer. <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2130853" rel="nofollow">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2130853</a> I don't know if that means "officially" or not, but it doesn't sounds like it, so official support is probably slightly later.</p>

<p>The question is why you want to know? You can't run it on Python 3 today. That's all that matters. The day you can run it on python 3, then it matters. Before that it doesn't. [Except to those doing the porting, of course ;-) ].</p>

<p>Predicting the future is easy. It's making the predictions come true that is the hard part. :-)</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The official FAQ mentions it might take <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/faq/install/#can-i-use-django-with-python-3" rel="nofollow">a year or two</a>, but I don't know when was that last revised. </p>

<p>I've been trying hard to find exactly where I've read their exact policies on Python support, but based on Django's <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/internals/release-process/" rel="nofollow">release process</a>, you can understand that it will take some considerable time as it will likely happen through a major release only. Even if they'd decide to provide Py3k support <em>today</em>, it could take anything from 1 to 4 major releases to deprecate support from Python 2.4 up to Python 2.7.</p>

<p>Django 1.3 will not run on Python3k.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Alex Gaynor thinks about making the port a google summer of code project:</p>
