<h3>Question (ID-447107):</h3><h2>what's the difference between encode/decode? (python 2.x)</h2><p>I've never been sure that I understand the difference between str/unicode decode and encode.</p>

<p>I know that <code>str().decode()</code> is for when you have a string of bytes that you know has a certain character encoding, given that encoding name it will return a unicode string.</p>

<p>I know that <code>unicode().encode()</code> converts unicode chars into a string of bytes according to a given encoding name.</p>

<p>But I don't understand what <code>str().encode()</code> and <code>unicode().decode()</code> are for. Can anyone explain, and possibly also correct anything else I've gotten wrong above?</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Several answers give info on what <code>.encode</code> does on a string, but no-one seems to know what <code>.decode</code> does for unicode.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The <code>decode</code> method of unicode strings really doesn't have any applications at all (unless you have some non-text data in a unicode string for some reason -- see below). It is mainly there for historical reasons, i think. In Python 3 it is completely gone.</p>

<p><code>unicode().decode()</code> will perform an implicit <em>encoding</em> of <code>s</code> using the default (ascii) codec. Verify this like so:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s = u'ö'
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.decode()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xf6' in position 0:
ordinal not in range(128)
</code></pre>

<p>For <code>str().encode()</code> it's the other way around -- it attempts an implicit <em>decoding</em> of <code>s</code> with the default encoding:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s = 'ö'
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.decode('utf-8')
u'\xf6'
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.encode()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc3 in position 0:
ordinal not in range(128)
</code></pre>

<p>Used like this, <code>str().encode()</code> is also superfluous.</p>

<p><strong>But</strong> there is another application of the latter method that is useful: there are <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings">encodings</a> that have nothing to do with character sets, and thus can be applied to 8-bit strings in a meaningful way:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s.encode('zip')
'x\x9c;\xbc\r\x00\x02&gt;\x01z'
</code></pre>

<p>You are right, though: the ambiguous usage of "encoding" for both these applications is... awkard. Again, with separate <code>byte</code> and <code>string</code> types in Python 3, this is no longer an issue.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>To represent a unicode string as a string of bytes is known as <b>encoding</b>. Use <code>u'...'.encode(encoding)</code>.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>
    >>> u'æøå'.encode('utf8')
    '\xc3\x83\xc2\xa6\xc3\x83\xc2\xb8\xc3\x83\xc2\xa5'
    >>> u'æøå'.encode('latin1')
    '\xc3\xa6\xc3\xb8\xc3\xa5'
    >>> u'æøå'.encode('ascii')
    UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode characters in position 0-5: 
    ordinal not in range(128)
</pre>

<p>You typically encode a unicode string whenever you need to use it for IO, for instance transfer it over the network, or save it to a disk file.</p>

<p>To convert a string of bytes to a unicode string is known as <b>decoding</b>. Use <code>unicode('...', encoding)</code> or '...'.decode(encoding).</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>
   >>> u'æøå'
   u'\xc3\xa6\xc3\xb8\xc3\xa5' # the interpreter prints the unicode object like so
   >>> unicode('\xc3\xa6\xc3\xb8\xc3\xa5', 'latin1')
   u'\xc3\xa6\xc3\xb8\xc3\xa5'
   >>> '\xc3\xa6\xc3\xb8\xc3\xa5'.decode('latin1')
   u'\xc3\xa6\xc3\xb8\xc3\xa5'
</pre>

<p>You typically decode a string of bytes whenever you receive string data from the network or from a disk file.</p>

<p>I believe there are some changes in unicode handling in python 3, so the above is probably not correct for python 3.</p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>mybytestring.encode(somecodec) is meaningful for these values of <code>somecodec</code>:</p>

<p>I am not sure what decoding an already decoded unicode text is good for. Trying that with any encoding seems to always try to encode with the system's default encoding first.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>There are a few encodings that can be used to de-/encode from str to str or from unicode to unicode. For example base64, hex or even rot13. They are listed in the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/codecs.html" rel="nofollow">codecs module</a>.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>The decode message on a unicode string can undo the corresponding encode operation:</p>

<pre><code>In [1]: u'0a'.decode('hex')
Out[1]: '\n'
</code></pre>

<p>The returned type is str instead of unicode which is unfortunate in my opinion. But when you are not doing a proper en-/decode between str and unicode this looks like a mess anyway.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You should read <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/368805/python-unicodedecodeerror-am-i-misunderstanding-encode#370199">Python UnicodeDecodeError - Am I misunderstanding encode</a>. My understanding of unicode in Python was a lot clearer after reading the accepted answer.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>anUnicode.<strong>encode</strong>('encoding') results in a <strong>string</strong> object and can be called on a unicode object  </p>

<p>aString.<strong>decode</strong>('encoding') results in an <strong>unicode</strong> object and can be called on a string, encoded in given encoding.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>Some more explanations:</p>

<p>You can create some unicode object, which doesn't have any encoding set. The way it is stored by Python in memory is none of your concern. You can search it, split it and call any string manipulating function you like.</p>

<p>But there comes a time, when you'd like to print your unicode object to console or into some text file. So you have to <strong>encode</strong> it (for example - in UTF-8), you call encode('utf-8') and you get a string with '\u&lt;someNumber&gt;' inside, which is perfectly printable.</p>

<p>Then, again - you'd like to do the opposite - read string encoded in UTF-8 and treat it as an Unicode, so the \u360 would be one character, not 5. Then you <strong>decode</strong> a string (with selected encoding) and get brand new object of the unicode type.</p>

<p>Just as a side note - you can select some pervert encoding, like 'zip', 'base64', 'rot' and some of them will convert from string to string, but I believe the most common case is one that involves UTF-8/UTF-16 and string.</p>
