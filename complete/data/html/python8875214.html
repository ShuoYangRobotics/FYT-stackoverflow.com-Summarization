<h3>Question (ID-8875214):</h3><h2>How can I name a block of code in Python so I can execute it multiple times by calling that name?</h2><p>I have some code that is basically 5 print statements that i would like to call several times throughout the script. I was thinking I could save some space and make the code easier to maintain if I wrote the code once, then called it later. A function would work but it prints <code>None</code> after it is done and that is annoying. Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Here is kinda what I am trying to do...</p>

<pre><code>name = "Bob"
House = "HOME"

print "hello,"
print name
print house
print "is where you are"
</code></pre>

<p>That is just an example, it is way more complicated than that, but i would like to put all of the print statements into a named "bucket" of sorts and then call that bucket.</p>

<p>And some of the code would not just be print statements, but also if statements as well.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>If it prints <code>None</code> it is probably because you're printing the result of the function, as well as letting the function print expressions.</p>

<p>e.g.</p>

<pre><code>def print_stuff():
    print "Hello, World"

print print_stuff()
&gt; Hello, World
&gt; None

# But print_stuff prints stuff, so you don't need to print it too:

print_stuff()
&gt; Hello, World
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>A function works - </p>

<p>A function does not "print None" - a function, without an explicit return statement returns "None" implicitly - and if you call it on the interactive shell, the <code>__repr__</code> of the returned None is printed to the console.</p>

<p>If youc all a function in a  running program, the value returned, which is the result of of evaluating the expression that is the function call, does not print anything, just as inserting a line like <code>2 + 2</code> in th emidle of the code won't print anything.</p>

<p>So, for your lines above, you can just do:</p>

<pre><code>def printer(name, house):
    print "hello,"
    print name
    print house
    print "is where you are"

printer("Bob", "Home")
</code></pre>

<p>And re-use it with as may calls to "printer" as you want.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Yes, it's called a function.</p>

<pre><code>def foo(name, house):
    print 'hello,', name, house, 'is where you are'

foo('bob', 'home')
</code></pre>

<p>Function doesn't print anything that you don't print inside it.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I think you can do that with a function (would be the obvious way to do), and I don't usually see None being printed after execution of functions containing print. In this case, probably you don't need a  <code>return</code> statement:</p>

<pre><code>def printblock(name, house):
    print "hello,"
    print name
    print house
    print "is where you are"

printblock("Bob", "HOME")
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><pre><code>def hello(name, house):
    print "hello,"
    print name
    print house
    print "is where you are"
    return

hello("Bob", "Home")
</code></pre>

<p>This is a standard python function. It shouldn't print anything unless you explicitly tell it to.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from string import Template
&gt;&gt;&gt; x=Template('Hello \n$name \n$house \nis where you are')
&gt;&gt;&gt; name='bob'
&gt;&gt;&gt; house='here'
&gt;&gt;&gt; print x.safe_substitute(name=name,house=house)
Hello
bob
here
is where you are
</code></pre>

<p>Hi there, as i recall from your question that you would need to use it several times, you may use the Template functionality of Python. you may kep all your variable in a list or dictionary and call the above given print statement using the for loop.</p>

<p>hope this helps, also explore the the template function. thank you :)</p>
