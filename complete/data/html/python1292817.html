<h3>Question (ID-1292817):</h3><h2>How to automate browsing using python?</h2><p>suppose, I need to perform a set of procedure on a particular website
say, fill some forms, click submit button, send the data back to server, receive the response, again do something based on the response and send the data back to the server of the website.
I know there is a webbrowser module in python, but I want to do this without invoking any web browser. It hast to be a pure script.</p>

<p>Is there a module available in python, which can help me do that?<br />
thanks</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You can also take a look at <a href="http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/" rel="nofollow">mechanize</a>. Its meant to handle <em>"stateful programmatic  web browsing"</em> (as per their site).</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You may have a look at these slides from the <a href="http://www.pycon.it/static/stuff/slides/tecniche-di-scraping-in-python.pdf" rel="nofollow">last italian pycon</a> (pdf):
The author listed most of the library for doing scraping and autoted browsing in python. so you may have a look at it.</p>

<p>I like very much <a href="http://twill.idyll.org/" rel="nofollow">twill</a> (which has already been suggested), which has been developed by one of the authors of nose and it is specifically aimed at testing web sites.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You likely want <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/urllib2.html" rel="nofollow">urllib2</a>. It can handle things like HTTPS, cookies, and authentication. You will probably also want <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/" rel="nofollow">BeautifulSoup</a> to help parse the HTML pages.</p>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>There are plenty of built in python modules that whould help with this. For example <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/urllib.html" rel="nofollow">urllib</a> and <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/htmllib.html" rel="nofollow">htmllib</a>.</p>

<p>The problem will be simpler if you change the way you're approaching it. You say you want to "fill some forms, click submit button, send the data back to server, recieve the response", which sounds like a four stage process.</p>

<p>In fact, what you need to do is post some data to a webserver and get a response.</p>

<p>This is as simple as:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import urllib
&gt;&gt;&gt; params = urllib.urlencode({'spam': 1, 'eggs': 2, 'bacon': 0})
&gt;&gt;&gt; f = urllib.urlopen("http://www.musi-cal.com/cgi-bin/query", params)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print f.read()
</code></pre>

<p>(example taken from the urllib docs).</p>

<p>What you do with the response depends on how complex the HTML is and what you want to do with it. You might get away with parsing it using a regular expression or two, or you can use the htmllib.HTMLParser class, or maybe a higher level more flexible parser like <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/" rel="nofollow">Beautiful Soup</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Internet Explorer specific, but rather good:</p>

<p><a href="http://pamie.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">http://pamie.sourceforge.net/</a></p>

<p>The advantage compared to urllib/BeautifulSoup is that it executes Javascript as well since it uses IE.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>httplib2 + beautifulsoup</p>

<p>Use firefox + firebug + httpreplay to see what the javascript passes to and from the browser from the website. Using httplib2 you can essentially do the same via post and get</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/" rel="nofollow">Selenium2</a> includes webdriver, which has <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/selenium/2.0rc2" rel="nofollow">python bindings</a> and allows one to use the headless htmlUnit driver, or switch to firefox or chrome for graphical debugging.</p>
