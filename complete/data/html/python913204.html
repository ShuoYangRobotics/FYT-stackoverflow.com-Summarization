<h3>Question (ID-913204):</h3><h2>Is it possible to install python 3 and 2.6 on same PC?</h2><p>How would I do this? The reason being I wanted to try some pygame out, but I have python 3 installed currently and have been learning with that. I'm also interested in trying out wxpython or something like that, but I haven't looked at their compatibilities yet.</p>

<p>EDIT:: im on a windows vista 64-bit</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>If you are on Windows, then just install another version of Python using the installer. It would be installed into another directory.</p>

<p>Then if you install other packages using the installer, it would ask you for which python installation to apply. If you use installation from source or easy_install, then just make sure that when you install, you are using the one of the proper version.</p>

<p>If you have many packages installed in your current python-3, then just make a zip backup of your current installation just in case.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Erm... yes. I just installed Python 3.0 on this computer to test it. You haven't specified your operating system, but I'm running Ubuntu 9.04 and I can explicitly specify the version of Python I want to run by typing <code>python2.5 myscript.py</code> or <code>python3.0 myscript.py</code>, depending on my needs.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Typically python is installed with a name like <code>python2.6</code>, so you can have more than one. There <em>may</em> be a symlink from <code>python</code> to one of the numbered files. Quite workable.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I would assume it'd be the same as running two versions of 2.x; as long as they're each in their own directory you should be OK.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You certainly can.  On Mac Ports, there's a tool called python_select that lets you switch among python versions; if nothing like it exists on Windows (momentary googling didn't reveal one), it could certainly be written.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Yes, it is possible. </p>

<p>I maintain 3 python installations (2.5, 2.6, 3.0). The only issue that could be confusing is figuring out which Python version takes precedence in PATH variable (if any) . To execute a script for a specific version, you would go into the python directory for that version</p>

<p>C:\Python25\ , C:\Python26\, C:\Python30\, etc. </p>

<p>Drop the file in there, and run "python.exe file.py" from command-line.</p>

<p>You could even rename each python.exe to python25.exe python26.exe python30.exe and have each directory in PATH so it would be easy to execute any script on any version.</p>
