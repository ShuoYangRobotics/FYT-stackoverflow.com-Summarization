<h3>Question (ID-949504):</h3><h2>Terminating a Python Program</h2><p>What command do you use in python to terminate a program?</p>

<p>i.e. the equivalent of "end" in basic, or "quit" in BASH.</p>

<p>I see that "break" takes you out of a loop, and "quit" is all tied up with "class" stuff that I do not comprehend yet.
i tried </p>

<pre><code>import sys
sys.exit()
</code></pre>

<p>but it will display following error :</p>

<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Documents and Settings\....\Desktop\current file_hand\Python_1.py", line 131, in &lt;module&gt;
    sys.exit()
SystemExit
</code></pre>

<p>is there any solution for it .</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p><code>sys.exit()</code> raises the <code>SystemExit</code> exception.</p>

<p>If you don't catch that exception the program ends.</p>

<p>Since you're getting that output, I'm not sure what is happening, but I guess that you're catching all exceptions and printing them yourself:</p>

<pre><code>try:
    ...
except:
    print exception somehow
    raise
</code></pre>

<p>If that's the case, don't do that. catch <code>Exception</code> instead:</p>

<pre><code>...
    except Exception:
        ...
</code></pre>

<p>That way you won't catch things not meant to be catched (like <code>SystemExit</code>).</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>sys.exit(error_code)  </p>

<p>Error_code will be 0 for a normal exit,  1 or some other positive number for an exit due to an error of some kind, e.g. the user has entered the wrong parameters.</p>

<p>sys.exit() "is undefined on some architectures", (although it worked when I tried it on my Linux box!)</p>

<p>The <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/sys.html" rel="nofollow">official python docs</a> explains this more fully. </p>

<p>It's an extremely good idea for all your programs and scripts to follow the return convention. </p>

<p>For example if you run a script which grabs some data out of a database; returning 0 and no output, means the database is perfectly fine there's just nothing in it (or nothing matching your query). returning 1 and no output means there is a fault with the database, the whole process should abort, because to continue would corrupt the other system too.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You should also consider alternatives to exiting directly.  Often <code>return</code> works just as well if you wrap code in a function.  (Better, in fact, because it avoids sys.exit() weirdness.)</p>

<pre><code>def main():
    ...do something...
    if something:
        return               # &lt;----- return takes the place of exit
    ...do something else...

main()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>import sys</p>

<p>sys.exit(0)</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Try running a python interpreter out of your IDE. In my Windows installation the simple command line <code>python.exe</code>, both options work:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import sys
&gt;&gt;&gt; sys.exit()
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; raise SystemExit
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>In your case, your error is likely that you have a bare except block that is catching the SystemExit exception, like this:</p>

<pre><code>import sys
try:
  sys.exit(return_code)
except:
  pass
</code></pre>

<p>The correct way to fix your problem is to remove the <strong>except:</strong> portion, and instead just catch the Exceptions you expect to be possibly raised.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>try:
  # Code which could raise exceptions
except (NameError, ValueError):
  # Do something in case of NameError or ValueError, but
  # ignore other exceptions (like SystemExit)
</code></pre>

<p>However, if you really wanted your program to exit, the following code will work:</p>

<pre><code>import os
try:
  os._exit(return_code)
except:
  pass
</code></pre>

<p>This will exit even with the <strong>except:</strong> clause, as it just directly calls the C function of the same name which kills your process.  This is <strong>not recommended</strong> unless you know what you are doing, since this will not call cleanup handlers or flush open IO buffers.</p>
