<h3>Question (ID-354097):</h3><h2>How to configure vim to not put comments at the beginning of lines while editing python files</h2><p>When I add a # in insert mode on an empty line in Vim while editing python files, vim moves the # to the beginning of the line, but I would like the # to be inserted at the tab level where I entered it.</p>

<p>For example, when writing this in vim</p>

<pre><code>for i in range(10):
    #
</code></pre>

<p>the # does not stay there where I entered it.</p>

<p>It is moved like so, by vim.</p>

<pre><code>for i in range(10):
#
</code></pre>

<p>Does anyone know of a configuration item in vim that would change this?</p>

<p>If it helps, I am using Ubuntu 8.10.</p>

<p>It seems that the vim smartindent option is the cause of the problem.
The referenced page above describes work-a-rounds but after reading the help in smartindent in vim itself (:help smartindent), I decided to try cindent instead of smartindent.</p>

<p>I replaced </p>

<pre><code>set smartindent
</code></pre>

<p>with </p>

<pre><code>set cindent
</code></pre>

<p>in my .vimrc file</p>

<p>and so far it is working perfectly.</p>

<p>This changed also fixed the behavior of '&lt;&lt;' and '>>' for indenting visual blocks that include python comments.</p>

<p>There are more configuration options for and information on indentation in the vim help for smartindent and cindent (:help smartindent and :help cindent).</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I have the following lines in my .vimrc, seems to be installed by default with my Ubuntu 8.10</p>

<pre><code>set smartindent
inoremap # X^H#
set autoindent
</code></pre>

<p>And I don't observe the problem. Maybe you can try this. (Note that ^H should be entered by Ctrl-V Ctrl-H)</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>PolyThinker: Though I see that response a lot to this question, it's not a good solution. The editor still thinks it should be indented all the way to left - check this by pushing == on a line that starts with a hash, or pushing = while a block of code with comments in it is highlighted to reindent.</p>

<p>The real solution is 'filetype indent on', and remove the smartindent and autoindent (or cindent) lines in your vimrc. Someone else (appparently David Bustos) was kind enough to write a full indentation parser for us; it's located at $VIMDIRECTORY/indent/python.vim.</p>

<p>(Paul's cindent solution probably works for python, but 'filetype indent on' is much more generally useful)</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>My Vim configuration doesn't do that.  You might try the python.vim script available from this link:  <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=790" rel="nofollow">http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=790</a></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>It's caused by the 'smartindent' feature. If you have <code>:set smartindent</code> in your .vimrc you need to remove it.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>@nevinera: I was having the same problem as the others (Python comments appearing at the first column when entered as the first character of a new line), but only your method fixed the problem in my case (I'm running version 7.2 on OS X 10.4).</p>
