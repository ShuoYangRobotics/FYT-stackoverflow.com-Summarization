<h3>Question (ID-3176773):</h3><h2>How can I improve this code?</h2><pre><code># max_list = [83, 1350, 1, 100]
for i in range(len(max_list)):
     new_value = 1
     while new_value &lt; max_list[i]:
          new_value *= 10
     max_list = new_value
</code></pre>

<p>What I'm doing is rounding numbers up to the closest, uhm, zero filled value? I'm not sure what it would be called. But basically, I want 83 -> 100, 1 -> 1, 1350 -> 10000, 100 -> 100. I tried using the round() function but couldn't get it to do what I wanted.</p>

<p>This does it but I thought it could be written in less lines.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I'd do it mathematically:</p>

<pre><code>from math import ceil, log10
int(pow(10, ceil(log10(abs(x or 0.1)))))
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><pre><code>def nextPowerOfTen(x):
  if x in [0, 1]:
     return x
  elif x &lt; 1:
    return -nextPowerOfTen(abs(x))
  else:
    return 10**len(str(int(x) - 1))

&gt;&gt;&gt; nextPowerOfTen(83)
100
&gt;&gt;&gt; nextPowerOfTen(1350)
10000
&gt;&gt;&gt; nextPowerOfTen(1)
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; nextPowerOfTen(100)
100
&gt;&gt;&gt; nextPowerOfTen(0)
0
&gt;&gt;&gt; nextPowerOfTen(-1)
-1
&gt;&gt;&gt; nextPowerOfTen(-2)
-10
</code></pre>

<p>It does something sensible with negatives, not sure if that is the behaviour you want or not.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><blockquote>
  <p>i need it to be 1350 / 10000 = 0.135 so it's in the [0, 1] range.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why didn't you say so initially?</p>

<pre><code>new_val = float("0." + str(old_val))
</code></pre>

<p>Unless you need the numbers for something else as well?</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 12345.678
&gt;&gt;&gt; y = round(x)
&gt;&gt;&gt; round(10 * y, -len(str(y)))
100000

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Pseudocode:</p>

<pre><code>div = input != 1 ? power(10,truncate(log10(abs(input))) + 1) : 1;
percent = input/div;
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Your original code was close, and more easily read than some terse expression.  The problem with your code is a couple of minor errors: initializing <code>new_value</code> each time in the initial scan, rather than only once; and replacing the <code>max_list</code> with a calculated scalar while looping over it as a list.</p>

<p>On the final line, you must have intended:</p>

<pre><code>    max_list[i] = float(max_list[i]) / new_value
</code></pre>

<p>but you dropped the array index, which would replace the list with a single value.  On the second iteration of the loop, your Python would give an exception due to the invalid index into a non-list.</p>

<p>Because your code develops greater and greater values of new_value as it progresses, I recommend you not replace the list items during the first scan.  Make a second scan once you calculate a final value for new_value:</p>

<pre><code>max_list = [83, 1350, 1, 100]

# Calculate the required "normalizing" power-of-ten
new_value = 1.0
for i in range(len(max_list)):
    while new_value &lt; max_list[i]:
        new_value *= 10.0

# Convert the values to fractions in [0.0, 1.0]
for i in range(len(max_list)):
    max_list[i] = max_list[i] / new_value

print max_list
# "[0.0083000000000000001, 0.13500000000000001, 0.0001, 0.01]"
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that I was required to initialize new_value as if it were a floating-point value, in order that it would result in floating-point quotients.  There are alternative ways to do this, such as using <code>float(max_list[i])</code> to retrieve the value for normalizing.  The original calculation of <code>new_value</code> was starting over with each element, so your example would return <code>new_value == 100</code> because this was based off the final element in the input list, which is 100.</p>

# works for floats, too.

y = [10**ceil(log10(el)) for el in x]

# alt list-comprehension if integers needed
