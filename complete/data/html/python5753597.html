<h3>Question (ID-5753597):</h3><h2>Is it Pythonic to use list comprehensions for just side effects?</h2><p>Think about a function that I'm calling for it's side effects, not return values(like printing to screen, updating gui, printing to a file, etc.). </p>

<pre><code>def fun_with_side_effects(x):
    ...side effects...
    return y
</code></pre>

<p>Now, is it <em>Pythonic</em> to use list comprehensions to call this func:</p>

<pre><code>[fun_with_side_effects(x) for x in y if (...conditions...)]
</code></pre>

<p><em>note that I don't save the list anywhere</em></p>

<p>Or should I call this func like this:</p>

<pre><code>for x in y:
    if (...conditions...):
        fun_with_side_effects(x)
</code></pre>

<p>Which is better and why?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You shouldn't use a <em>list</em> comprehension, because as people have said that will build a large temporary list that you don't need. The following two methods are equivalent:</p>

<pre><code>consume(side_effects(x) for x in xs)

for x in xs:
    side_effects(x)
</code></pre>

<p>with the definition of <code>consume</code> from the <code>itertools</code> man page:</p>

<pre><code>def consume(iterator, n=None):
    "Advance the iterator n-steps ahead. If n is none, consume entirely."
    # Use functions that consume iterators at C speed.
    if n is None:
        # feed the entire iterator into a zero-length deque
        collections.deque(iterator, maxlen=0)
    else:
        # advance to the empty slice starting at position n
        next(islice(iterator, n, n), None)
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, the latter is clearer and easier to understand.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>List comprehensions are for creating lists. And unless you are actually creating a list, you should <em>not</em> use list comprehensions.</p>

<p>So I would got for the second option, just iterating over the list and then call the function when the conditions apply.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Second is better.</p>

<p>Think of the person who would need to understand your code. You can get bad karma easily with the first :)</p>

<p>You could go middle between the two by using filter(). Consider the example:</p>

<pre><code>y=[1,2,3,4,5,6]
def func(x):
    print "call with %r"%x

for x in filter(lambda _: True if _ &gt; 3 else False,y):
    func(x)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Depends on your goal.</p>

<p>If you are trying to do some operation on each object in a list, the second approach should be adopted.</p>

<p>If you are trying to generate a list from another list, you may use list comprehension.</p>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You can do</p>

<pre><code>for z in (fun_with_side_effects(x) for x in y if (...conditions...)): pass
</code></pre>

<p>but it's not very pretty.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I would do this instead:</p>

<pre><code>any(fun_with_side_effects(x) and False for x in y if (...conditions...))
</code></pre>

<p>This is a generator expression, and does not generate a random list that gets tossed out. I think it is ugly and I wouldn't actually do it in code. But if you insist on implementing your loops in this fashion, that's how I would do it.</p>

<p>I tend to feel that list comprehensions and their ilk should signal an attempt to use something at least faintly resembling a functional style. Putting things with side effects that break that assumption will cause people to have to read your code more carefully, and I think that's a bad thing.</p>
