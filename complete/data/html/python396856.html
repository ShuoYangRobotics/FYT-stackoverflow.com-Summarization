<h3>Question (ID-396856):</h3><h2>How to instantiate a class in python</h2><p>So, I'm trying to learn Python.  It seems pretty easy, but evidently, I don't understand how classes are used.  The following code gives me an error when I try to use the class.</p>

<pre><code>class mystuff:
        def average(a,b,c): #get the average of three numbers
                result=a+b+c
                result=result/3
                return result

#now use the function average from the mystuff class
print mystuff.average(9,18,27)


File "class.py", line 7, in &lt;module&gt;
    print mystuff.average(9,18,27)
TypeError: unbound method average() must be called with mystuff instance as first argument (got int instance instead)
</code></pre>

<p>What's wrong?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>From your example, it seems to me you want to use a static method.</p>

<pre><code>class mystuff:
  @staticmethod
  def average(a,b,c): #get the average of three numbers
    result=a+b+c
    result=result/3
    return result

print mystuff.average(9,18,27)
</code></pre>

<p>Please note that an heavy usage of static methods in python is usually a symptom of some bad smell - if you really need functions, then declare them directly on module level.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You can instantiate the class by declaring a variable and calling the class as if it were a function:</p>

<pre><code>x = mystuff()
print x.average(9,18,27)
</code></pre>

<p>However, this won't work with the code you gave us.  When you call a class method on a given object (x), it always passes a pointer to the object as the first parameter when it calls the function.  So if you run your code right now, you'll see this error message:</p>

<pre><code>TypeError: average() takes exactly 3 arguments (4 given)
</code></pre>

<p>To fix this, you'll need to modify the definition of the average method to take four parameters.  The first parameter is an object reference, and the remaining 3 parameters would be for the 3 numbers.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I won't answer this question. Sorry to act like this, but it really won't help you.</p>

<p>Please read <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/" rel="nofollow">the tutorial on the Python website</a>. There is <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/classes.html" rel="nofollow">a section on classes</a>, but please read the whole thing. It should only take a few hours at the most.</p>

<p>I shall then be happy to answer any questions you have.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>In python member function of a class need explicit <code>self</code> argument. Same as implicit <code>this</code> pointer in C++. For more details please check out <a href="http://diveintopython.org/object_oriented_framework/defining_classes.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> page.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You need to spend a little more time on some fundamentals of object-oriented programming.</p>

<p>This sounds harsh, but it's important.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Your class definition is incorrect -- although the syntax happens to be acceptable.  The definition is simply wrong. </p></li>
<li><p>Your use of the class to create an object is entirely missing.</p></li>
<li><p>Your use of a class to do a calculation is inappropriate.  This kind of thing can be done, but it requires the advanced concept of a <code>@staticmehod</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Since your example code is wrong in so many ways, you can't get a tidy "fix this" answer.  There are too many things to fix.</p>

<p>You'll need to look at better examples of class definitions.  It's not clear what source material you're using to learn from, but whatever book you're reading is either wrong or incomplete.</p>

<p>Please discard whatever book or source you're using and find a better book.  Seriously.  They've mislead you on how a class definition looks and how it's used.</p>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Every function inside a class, and every class variable must take the <em>self</em> argument as pointed.</p>

<pre><code>class mystuff:
    def average(a,b,c): #get the average of three numbers
            result=a+b+c
            result=result/3
            return result
    def sum(self,a,b):
            return a+b


print mystuff.average(9,18,27) # should raise error
print mystuff.sum(18,27) # should be ok
</code></pre>

<p>If class variables are involved:</p>

<pre><code> class mystuff:
    def setVariables(self,a,b):
            self.x = a
            self.y = b
            return a+b
    def mult(self):
            return x * y
    def sum(self):
            return self.x + self.y

 print mystuff.SetVariables(9,18) # Setting mystuff.x and mystuff.y
 print mystuff.mult() # should raise error
 print mystuff.sum()  # should be ok
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>You never created an instance.</p>

<p>You've defined average as an instance method, thus, in order to use average you need to create an instance first.</p>
