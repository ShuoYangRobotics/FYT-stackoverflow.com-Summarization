<h3>Question (ID-3858238):</h3><h2>checking when all data is sent using non-blocking open</h2><p>If I open a a file as <code>os.open( '/dev/ttyS2', O_RDWR | O_NDELAY )</code>, is there any way that I can check when my 'write()' commands have finished? Or, can I open a file for non-blocking read but blocking write?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>If you are writing to a tty (as you are in your example), you can use <code>termios.tcdrain</code> to wait until all written bytes have been transmitted.</p>

<p>Your <code>write</code> systems calls will still be non-blocking, so you will need to handle <code>EWOULDBLOCK</code>/<code>EAGAIN</code> errors, and use <code>select(2)</code>, <code>poll(2)</code> or <code>epoll(7)</code> to know when you can write to the file descriptor. These are designed to be used with non-blocking file descriptors.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You have a misunderstanding of what non-blocking means.  It does <strong>not</strong> imply asynchronous operation - you can have any combination of asynchronous/synchronous and blocking/non-blocking.</p>

<p>A <code>write()</code> just hands data off to the kernel to take care of.  When <code>write()</code> returns successfully, the kernel has now taken care of the data - this is true regardless of whether the file descriptor is blocking or non-blocking.  Whether or not the kernel has actually finished writing it at this point is a separate matter (usually, the answer is "no" - most file descriptors are asynchronous).</p>

<p>A <code>write()</code> cannot complete if the kernel has no more room to buffer the data you want to write, and this is the case that is affected by non-blocking versus blocking - in the blocking case, the <code>write()</code> will block until space is available.  In the non-blocking case, <code>write()</code> will return an error (<code>EAGAIN</code>), and it is up to you to retry it later.</p>

<p>If you wish to wait until all data written to a terminal device has actually been sent to the hardware, use <code>tcdrain()</code> - but this is likely to be unnecessary.  Alternatively, if you wish <code>write()</code> to block until your data is accepted by the kernel, then you can use <code>fcntl()</code> to temporarily set the file descriptor to blocking.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>The O_NDELAY flag always affects both reading and writing. To achieve a blocking write on a non-blocking file you can select (Python module) the file and write when it becomes writable in a loop.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>OS API write() returns count of written bytes. Checking this value against size of your input you can see when all input is sent.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Open two file descriptors to the same location - one for non-blocking reads and the other for blocking writes.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Have you tried <code>os.fsync(fd)</code>?</p>
