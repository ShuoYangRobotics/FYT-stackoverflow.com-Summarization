<h3>Question (ID-5758254):</h3><h2>Python - sort list of list</h2><p>I have a list in this format:</p>

<p>exon_start exon_finish gene_name (repeated hundreds of times)</p>

<p>I want to sort by exon_start</p>

<p>Example list:</p>

<pre><code> ['8342758', '8344137', 'NM_001042682']
 ['85420368', '85421471', 'NM_032184']
 ['86363115', '86364485', 'NM_152890']
 ['89820771', '89822936', 'NM_015350']
 ['904123', '905900', 'NR_027693']
 ['91176416', '91179454', 'NM_201269']
 ['92418409', '92420740', 'NM_015237']
 ['93575521', '93577419', 'NR_034089']
 ['94114411', '94116006', 'NM_014597']
 ['99926918', '99928016', 'NM_017734']
</code></pre>

<p>This list of lists (printed above) has already been sorted with the following code:</p>

<pre><code>sorted_triplets = sorted(triplets, key=lambda x: x[0])
for i in sorted_triplets:
    print i
</code></pre>

<p>However, "sorted" isn't working like I expect. As you can see from the list, 904123 is less than 89820771. So it appears that "sorted" isn't comparing the numbers as a whole, rather as individual digits. </p>

<p>How do I fix this?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>It's sorting them as strings, so the order is 'alphabetically'. Which is to say, it's going character by character and comparing, instead of comparing them as scalar values.</p>

<p>So do:</p>

<pre><code>sorted_triplets = sorted(triplets, key=lambda x: int(x[0]))
</code></pre>

<p>And it should work.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>convert strings to numbers</p>

<pre><code>sorted(triplets, key=lambda x: int(x[0]))
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Convert exon_start to an integer, strings are sorted lexicographically.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Right, because what you have are strings, not numbers. It will be sorted lexicographically. You may want to convert them to numbers (integers) first.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>It seems like your "number" is actually a string. Convert this string to an integer ( int(string) ), then the sorting should work</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Add int() call.</p>

<pre><code>sorted_triplets = sorted(triplets, key=lambda x: int(x[0]))
</code></pre>
