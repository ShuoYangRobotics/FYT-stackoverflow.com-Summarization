<h3>Question (ID-5926114):</h3><h2>Optimization of importing modules in Python</h2><p>I am reading David Beazley's Python Reference book and he makes a point:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example, if you were performing a
  lot of square root operations, it is
  faster to use 'from math import sqrt'
  and 'sqrt(x)' rather than typing
  'math.sqrt(x)'.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For calculations involving heavy use
  of methods or module lookups, it is
  almost always better to eliminate the
  attribute lookup by putting the
  operation you want  to perform into a
  local variable first.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I decided to try it out:</p>

<p>first()</p>

<pre><code>def first():
    from collections import defaultdict
    x = defaultdict(list)
</code></pre>

<p>second()</p>

<pre><code>def second():
    import collections
    x = collections.defaultdict(list)
</code></pre>

<p>The results were:</p>

<pre><code>2.15461492538
1.39850616455
</code></pre>

<p>Optimizations such as these probably don't matter to me. But I am curious as to why the opposite of what Beazley has written comes out to be true. And note that there is a difference of 1 second, which is singificant given the task is trivial. </p>

<p>Why is this happening? </p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>I am getting the timings like:</p>

<pre><code>print timeit('first()', 'from __main__ import first');
print timeit('second()', 'from __main__ import second');
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The <code>from collections import defaultdict</code> and <code>import collections</code> should be outside the iterated timing loops, since you won't repeat doing them.</p>

<p>I guess that the <code>from</code> syntax has to do more work that the <code>import</code> syntax.</p>

<p>Using this test code:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python

import timeit

from collections import defaultdict
import collections

def first():
    from collections import defaultdict
    x = defaultdict(list)

def firstwithout():
    x = defaultdict(list)

def second():
    import collections
    x = collections.defaultdict(list)

def secondwithout():
    x = collections.defaultdict(list)

print "first with import",timeit.timeit('first()', 'from __main__ import first');
print "second with import",timeit.timeit('second()', 'from __main__ import second');

print "first without import",timeit.timeit('firstwithout()', 'from __main__ import firstwithout');
print "second without import",timeit.timeit('secondwithout()', 'from __main__ import secondwithout');
</code></pre>

<p>I get results:</p>

<pre><code>first with import 1.61359190941
second with import 1.02904295921
first without import 0.344709157944
second without import 0.449721097946
</code></pre>

<p>Which shows how much the repeated imports cost.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I'll get also similar ratios between <code>first(.)</code> and <code>second(.)</code>, only difference is that the timings are in microsecond level.</p>

<p>I don't think that your timings measure anything useful. Try to figure out better test cases!</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong><br>
FWIW, here is some tests to support David Beazley's point.</p>

<pre><code>import math
from math import sqrt

def first(n= 1000):
    for k in xrange(n):
        x= math.sqrt(9)

def second(n= 1000):
    for k in xrange(n):
        x= sqrt(9)

In []: %timeit first()
1000 loops, best of 3: 266 us per loop
In [: %timeit second()
1000 loops, best of 3: 221 us per loop
In []: 266./ 221
Out[]: 1.2036199095022624
</code></pre>

<p>So <code>first()</code> is some 20% slower than <code>second()</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>My guess, your test is biased and the second implementation gains from the first one already having loaded the module, or just from having it loaded recently. </p>

<p>How many times did you try it? Did you switch up the order, etc..</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p><code>first()</code> doesn't save anything, since the module must still be accessed in order to import the name.</p>

<p>Also, you don't give your timing methodology but given the function names it seems that <code>first()</code> performs the initial import, which is always longer than subsequent imports since the module must be compiled and executed.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>There is also the question of efficiency of reading/understanding the source code. Here's a real live example (code from a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5895832">stackoverflow question</a>)</p>

<p>Original:</p>

<pre><code>import math

def midpoint(p1, p2):
   lat1, lat2 = math.radians(p1[0]), math.radians(p2[0])
   lon1, lon2 = math.radians(p1[1]), math.radians(p2[1])
   dlon = lon2 - lon1
   dx = math.cos(lat2) * math.cos(dlon)
   dy = math.cos(lat2) * math.sin(dlon)
   lat3 = math.atan2(math.sin(lat1) + math.sin(lat2), math.sqrt((math.cos(lat1) + dx) * (math.cos(lat1) + dx) + dy * dy))
   lon3 = lon1 + math.atan2(dy, math.cos(lat1) + dx)
   return(math.degrees(lat3), math.degrees(lon3))
</code></pre>

<p>Alternative:</p>

<pre><code>from math import radians, degrees, sin, cos, atan2, sqrt

def midpoint(p1, p2):
   lat1, lat2 = radians(p1[0]), radians(p2[0])
   lon1, lon2 = radians(p1[1]), radians(p2[1])
   dlon = lon2 - lon1
   dx = cos(lat2) * cos(dlon)
   dy = cos(lat2) * sin(dlon)
   lat3 = atan2(sin(lat1) + sin(lat2), sqrt((cos(lat1) + dx) * (cos(lat1) + dx) + dy * dy))
   lon3 = lon1 + atan2(dy, cos(lat1) + dx)
   return(degrees(lat3), degrees(lon3))

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Write your code as usual, importing a module and referencing its modules and constants as <code>module.attribute</code>. Then, either prefix your functions with the <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/277940-decorator-for-bindingconstants-at-compile-time/" rel="nofollow">decorator for binding constants</a> or bind all modules in your program by using the <code>bind_all_modules</code> function below:</p>
