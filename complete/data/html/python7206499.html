<h3>Question (ID-7206499):</h3><h2>Match letter in any language</h2><p>How can I match a letter from any language using a regex in python 3?</p>

<p><code>re.match([a-zA-Z])</code> will match the english language characters but I want all languages to be supported simultaneously. </p>

<p>I don't wish to match the <code>'</code> in <code>can't</code> or underscores or any other type of formatting. I do wish my regex to match: <code>c</code>, <code>a</code>, <code>n</code>, <code>t</code>, <code>Å</code>, <code>é</code>, and <code>中</code>.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Use <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/regex" rel="nofollow">Matthew Barnett’s <code>regex</code> library</a> instead of standard <code>re</code>, which is not really suitable for Unicode regular expressions.</strong></li>
<li>Use only Python 3, never Python 2. You want all your strings to be Unicode strings.</li>
<li>Use only string literals with logical/abstract Unicode codepoints, not encoded byte strings. </li>
<li>Set your encoding on your streams and forget about it. If you find yourself ever manually calling <code>.encode</code> and such, you’re almost certainly doing something wrong.</li>
<li>Use only a wide build where code points and code units are the same, never ever ever a narrow one — which you might do well to consider deprecated for Unicode robustness.</li>
<li>Normalize all incoming strings to NFD on the way in and then NFC on the way out. Otherwise you can’t get reliable behavior.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once you do this, you can safely write patterns that include <code>\w</code> or <code>\p{script=Latin}</code> or  <code>\p{alpha}</code> and <code>\p{lower}</code> etc and know that these will all do what <a href="http://unicode.org/reports/tr18/#Compatibility_Properties" rel="nofollow">the Unicode Standard says they should</a>. I explain all of this business of Python Unicode regex business in much more detail <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7063420/perl-compatible-regular-expression-pcre-in-python/7066413#7066413">in this answer</a>. The short story is to always use <code>regex</code> not <code>re</code>.</p>

<p>For general Unicode advice, I also have <a href="http://training.perl.com/OSCON2011/index.html" rel="nofollow">several talks from last OSCON</a> about Unicode regular expressions, most of which apart from the 3rd talk alone is not about Python, but much of which is adaptable.</p>

<p>Finally, there’s always <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6162484/why-does-modern-perl-avoid-utf-8-by-default/6163129#6163129">this answer</a> to put the fear of God (or at least, of Unicode) in your heart.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>What's wrong with using the \w special sequence?</p>

<pre><code># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import re
test = u"can't, Å, é, and 中ABC"
print re.findall('\w+', test, re.UNICODE)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Build a match class of all the characters you want to match. This might become <em>very</em>, <em>very</em> large. No, there is no RegEx shorthand for "All Kanji" ;)</p>

<p>Maybe it is easier to match for what you do not want, but even then, this class would become extremely large.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>What if you did your regular expression by excluding symbols?</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You can match on</p>

<pre><code>\p{L}
</code></pre>

<p>which matches any Unicode code point that represents a letter of a script. That is, assuming you actually have a Unicode-capable regex engine, which I really hope Python would have.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><pre>
import re

text = "can't, Å, é, and 中ABC"
print(re.findall('\w+', text))
</pre>

<p>This works in Python 3. But it also matches underscores. However this seems to do the job as I wish:</p>

<pre>
import regex

text = "can't, Å, é, and 中ABC _ sh_t"
print(regex.findall('\p{alpha}+', text))
</pre>
