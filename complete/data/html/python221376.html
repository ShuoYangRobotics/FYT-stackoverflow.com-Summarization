<h3>Question (ID-221376):</h3><h2>Putting Copyright Symbol into a Python File</h2><p>I need to include a copyright statement at the top of every Python source file I produce:</p>

<pre><code>#   Copyright: © 2008 etc.
</code></pre>

<p>However, when I then run such a file I get this message:</p>

<p>SyntaxError: Non-ASCII character '\xa9' in file MyFile.py on line 3, but no encoding declared; see <a href="http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0263.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0263.html</a> for details.</p>

<p>Apparently Python isn't happy about the copyright symbol because it assumes the source file is all in ASCII. Either I need to make my first line be:</p>

<pre><code># -*- coding: iso-8859-1 -*-
</code></pre>

<p>to tell Python I'm using Latin encoding, or I can change the copyright statement to: </p>

<pre><code>#   Copyright: \xa9 2008 etc.
</code></pre>

<p>which just possibly doesn't have the same legal standing.</p>

<p>Is there a more elegant solution?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The copyright symbol in ASCII is spelled <code>(c)</code>  or "<code>Copyright</code>".</p>

<p>See circular 61, <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ61.pdf" rel="nofollow">Copyright Registration for Computer Programs</a>. </p>

<p>While it's true that the legal formalism (see Circular 1, <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ01.pdf" rel="nofollow">Copyright Basics</a>) is </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The symbol © (the letter C in a
  circle), or the word “Copyright,” or
  the abbreviation “Copr.”; and...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And it's also true that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To guarantee protection for a
  copyrighted work in all UCC member
  countries, the notice must consist of
  the symbol © (the word “Copyright” or
  the abbreviation is not acceptable)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can dig through circular <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ03.html" rel="nofollow">3</a> and <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ38a.html" rel="nofollow">38a</a>.</p>

<p>This has, however, already been tested in court.  It isn't an interesting issue.  If you do a search for "(c) acceptable for c-in-a-circle", you'll find that lawyers all agree that (c) is an acceptable substitute.  See Perle and Williams.  See Scott on Information Technology Law.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Contrary to the accepted answer, AFAIK, (c) is not an officially recognized alternative to the copyright symbol, although I'm not sure it's been tested in court.</p>

<p>However, © is just an abreviation of the word Copyright. Saying "Copyright 2008 Robert Munro" is identical to saying "© 2008 Robert Munro"</p>

<p>Your "Copyright: © 2008 etc." Expands to "Copyright: Copyright 2008 etc."</p>

<p>Wikipedia's page seems to agree with me <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_symbol" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_symbol</a></p>

<p>In the United States, the copyright notice consists of three elements:
   1. the © symbol, <strong>or</strong> the word "Copyright" or abbreviation "Copr.";
...</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You can always revert to good old (c)</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Waiting for <a href="http://docs.python.org/dev/3.0/whatsnew/3.0.html" rel="nofollow">Python 3k</a>, where the default encoding of the source will be UTF-8?</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>For Python 2, the "right" thing to do is to specify the encoding, or never use non-ASCII characters.  Specifying the encoding makes it simpler on the compiler and on humans.  Sorry, but Python originally specified ASCII as the default, back in the Dark Ages.</p>

<p>For Python 3, UTF-8 is the default encoding, so you should be fine.  In that case I would recommend not specifying the encoding if you use the default.</p>

<p>Whether a language allows/requires an encoding specification or not, in the age of Unicode this is an issue we need to keep in mind for every "text" file.</p>
