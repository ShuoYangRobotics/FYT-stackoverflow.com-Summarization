<h3>Question (ID-6819653):</h3><h2>Plotting points in python</h2><p>I want to plot some (x,y) points on the same graph and I don't need any special features at all short of support for polar coordinates which would be nice but not necessary. It's mostly for visualizing my data. Is there a simple way to do this? Matplotlib seems like way more than I need right now. Are there any more basic modules available? What do You recommend?</p>

<p>See this <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/NumericAndScientific/Plotting" rel="nofollow">link</a> for list of plotting tools for python...</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Absolutely. Matplotlib is the way to go. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/users/pyplot_tutorial.html" rel="nofollow">pyplot module</a> provides a nice interface to get simple plots up and running fast, especially if you are familiar with MatLab's plotting environment. Here is a simple example using pyplot:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
&gt;&gt;&gt; fig = plt.figure()
&gt;&gt;&gt; ax = fig.add_subplot(111)
&gt;&gt;&gt; x_points = xrange(0,9)
&gt;&gt;&gt; y_points = xrange(0,9)
&gt;&gt;&gt; p = ax.plot(x_points, y_points, 'b')
&gt;&gt;&gt; ax.set_xlabel('x-points')
&gt;&gt;&gt; ax.set_ylabel('y-points')
&gt;&gt;&gt; ax.set_title('Simple XY point plot')
&gt;&gt;&gt; fig.show()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You can use the <a href="http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/canvas.htm" rel="nofollow">Tkinter canvas widget</a>. It uses rectangular coordinates but of course you can translate to polar. The canvas is pretty much just like it sounds -- a blank canvas on which you can draw points, lines, circles, rectangles, etc.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You could always write a plotting function that uses the <code>turtle</code> module from the standard library.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I suggest the most good looking plotting library for Python: <a href="http://linil.wordpress.com/2008/09/16/cairoplot-11/" rel="nofollow">CairoPlot</a></p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p><a href="http://mathgl.sf.net/" rel="nofollow">MathGL</a> is GPL plotting library which have Python interface, arbitrary (including polar) curved coordinates, a lot of plot types, export to PNG, EPS, SVG, widgets, and so on. For 1D plot samples see <a href="http://mathgl.sourceforge.net/en/1d_plots.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
