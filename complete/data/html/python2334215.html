If you want to prove that you know how to use python then write a personal project in python and make it's source available. Of course it has to be good quality code, otherwise it will have the opposite effect :)</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>@srisar: Not sure if you're still following this thread, but O'Reilly School of Technology recently announced their Python Programming Certification course.</p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>There are no official Python certifications as of yet.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Start building a portfolio.  One easy way to do this is get yourself a bitbucket account, fork some projects, make some contributions, and get them pulled back to the main branch.  Then when you send a resume out, include a link to <a href="http://bitbucket.org/srisar" rel="nofollow">http://bitbucket.org/srisar</a>, or whatever you get for your username.  Or github.  It doesn't matter which.  But that will let prospective employers see what you've done.  They can even check the change logs for your specific contributions.</p>

</ul>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>If you're interested in be contracted as a professional python programmer, you should be able to prove your skills in tests during job interview. I think there're getting much common these days, and companies rely more on testing personally the people than on an external professional certificate.</p>
