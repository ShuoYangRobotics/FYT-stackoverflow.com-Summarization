<h3>Question (ID-1592088):</h3><h2>A simple framework for Google App Engine (like Sinatra)?</h2><p>Is there a simple 'wrapper' framework for appengine? Something like <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/" rel="nofollow">Sinatra</a> or <a href="http://github.com/breily/juno" rel="nofollow">Juno</a>? So that one can write code like the following:</p>

<pre><code>from juno import *

@route('/')
def index(web):
    return 'Juno says hi'

run()
</code></pre>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: I want to use the Python API (not Java) in GAE.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>No such framework has been released at this time, to the best of my knowledge (most people appear to be quite happy with Django I guess;-).  You could try using Juno with <a href="http://gist.github.com/140565" rel="nofollow">this patch</a> -- it doesn't seem to be quite ready for prime time, but then again, it IS a pretty tiny patch, maybe little more is needed to allow Juno to work entirely on GAE!</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I use <a href="http://webpy.org/" rel="nofollow">web.py</a>. It's really simple and doesn't get in your way.</p>

<p>This is how it looks:</p>

<pre><code>import web

urls = (
    '/(.*)', 'hello'
)
app = web.application(urls, globals())

class hello:        
    def GET(self, name):
        if not name: 
            name = 'world'
        return 'Hello, ' + name + '!'

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Another framework that I've been meaning to try out is <a href="http://bloog.billkatz.com/" rel="nofollow">Bloog</a>. It is actually a blog engine for GAE but also provides a framework for developing other GAE apps.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p><a href="http://bottle.paws.de/docs/dev/index.html" rel="nofollow">Bottle</a> is one-single-file framework, so it's very easy to deploy it on GAE.</p>

<p>Bottle is similar with Sinatra, see the "hello world" example below:</p>

<p>Sinatra:</p>

<pre><code>require 'sinatra'
get '/hi' do
  "Hello World!"
end
</code></pre>

<p>Bottle:</p>

<pre><code>from bottle import *
@get('/hi')
    def hi():
        return "Hello World!"
</code></pre>

<p>Though I have to admit that Ruby is better for DSL.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You should check out <a href="http://gaelyk.appspot.com/" rel="nofollow">gaelyk</a>.  It's a lightweight framework on top of appengine that uses groovy.</p>
