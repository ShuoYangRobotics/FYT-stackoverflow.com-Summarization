<h3>Question (ID-2127181):</h3><h2>Any Python alternatives to Selenium for programmatically logging into websites that require JavaScript for login?</h2><p>I’m writing a little private app to automatically log into my internet banking every day, and download the latest transactions. I’m writing it as a Django app, so I’m working in Python.</p>

<p>My internet banking doesn’t seem to work without JavaScript — I think it uses JavaScript to assign a session ID of some sort. Fetching the sign-in page via <code>httplib</code> gives me a page telling me JavaScript’s required.</p>

<p>So, I’m now looking for libraries that fetch web pages, <strong>and</strong> execute the JavaScript on them. Pretty much headless browsers.</p>

<p>I’m fiddling about <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/" rel="nofollow">Selenium</a> at the moment. I think it’ll do the job, although it is designed for testing web apps, so I was wondering if there was anything with similar capabilities designed for more general purposes than testing.</p>

<p>Any Python alternatives to Selenium for this sort of thing?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You can use <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pywebkitgtk/" rel="nofollow">Pywebkitgtk</a>. There is a <a href="http://blog.motane.lu/2009/06/18/pywebkitgtk-execute-javascript-from-python/" rel="nofollow">nice tutorial here</a>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can use <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/" rel="nofollow">Beautiful Soup</a> to get the page contents and something like <a href="http://code.google.com/p/python-spidermonkey/" rel="nofollow">python-spidermonkey</a> to run the scripts.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>since you use selenium I think you have already installed firefox. if so get an extension like firebug or tamper data and see what http-requests the javascript code will do while logging in.</p>

<p>if you have the url and the parameters needed you can easily program a python client with httplib or urllib2.</p>

<p>in firebug you find the requested urls under "NET". tamper data will be self descriptive. ;-)</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Looks like <a href="http://blog.motane.lu/2009/07/07/downloading-a-pages-content-with-python-and-webkit/" rel="nofollow">QtWebKit</a> is another option.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Since BeautifulSoup is no longer being actively developed I would recommend <a href="http://codespeak.net/lxml/" rel="nofollow">lxml</a> since it does all the things that BeautifulSoup can do and a lot more.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I think a good match for your problem is <a href="http://twill.idyll.org/" rel="nofollow">Twill</a>: a simple scripting language for Web browsing.</p>

<p>An other one to check is <a href="http://www.getwindmill.com/" rel="nofollow">Windmill</a> (a kind of Selenium but all written in Python).</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You can also use <a href="http://code.google.com/p/spynner/" rel="nofollow">Spynner</a>, it allows programmatic web browsing.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Try BeautifulSoup, I believe it parses Javascript as well!</p>
