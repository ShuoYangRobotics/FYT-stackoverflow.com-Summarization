<h3>Question (ID-3549075):</h3><h2>Regex to find all sentences of text?</h2><p>I have been trying to teach myself Regexes in python and I decided to print out all the sentences of a text. I have been tinkering with the regular expressions for the past 3 hours to no avail.</p>

<p>I just tried the following but couldn't do anything. </p>

<pre><code>p = open('anan.txt')
process = p.read()
regexMatch = re.findall('^[A-Z].+\s+[.!?]$',process,re.I)
print regexMatch
p.close()
</code></pre>

<p>My input file is like this:</p>

<pre><code>OMG is this a question ! Is this a sentence ? My.
name is.
</code></pre>

<p>This prints no outputs. But when I remove "My. name is.", it prints OMG is this a question and Is this a sentence together as if it only reads the first line.</p>

<p>What is the best solution of regex that can find all sentences in a text file - regardless if the sentence carries to new line or so - and also reads the entire text? Thanks.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>There are two issues in your regex:</p>

<ol>
<li>Your expression is <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/anchors.html" rel="nofollow">anchored</a> by <code>^</code> and <code>$</code>, which are the "start of line" and "end of line" anchors, respectively. That means that your pattern is looking to match an entire line of your text.</li>
<li>You are searching for <code>\s+</code> before your punctuation character, which specifies <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/repeat.html" rel="nofollow">one or more</a> <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/charclass.html#shorthand" rel="nofollow">whitespace character</a>. If you don't have whitespace before your punctuation, the expression will not match.</li>
</ol>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I tried on Notepad++, and I got this :</p>

<pre><code>.*$
</code></pre>

<p>And activate the multiline option : </p>

<p><code>re.MULTILINE</code></p>

<p>Cheers</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Try the other way around: Split the text at sentence boundaries.</p>

<pre><code>lines = re.split(r'\s*[!?.]\s*', text)
</code></pre>

<p>If that doesn't work, add a <code>\</code> before the <code>.</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Something like this works:</p>

<pre><code>## pattern: Upercase, then anything that is not in (.!?), then one of them
&gt;&gt;&gt; pat = re.compile(r'([A-Z][^\.!?]*[\.!?])', re.M)
&gt;&gt;&gt; pat.findall('OMG is this a question ! Is this a sentence ? My. name is.')
['OMG is this a question !', 'Is this a sentence ?', 'My.']
</code></pre>

<p>Notice how <code>name is.</code> is not in the result because it does not start with a uppercase letter. </p>

<p>Your problem comes from the use of the <code>^$</code> anchors, they work on the whole text.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p><em>Edited:</em> now it will work with multiline sentences too.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = "OMG is this a question ! Is this a sentence ? My\n name is."
&gt;&gt;&gt; re.findall("[A-Z].*?[\.!?]", t, re.MULTILINE | re.DOTALL )
['OMG is this a question !', 'Is this a sentence ?', 'My\n name is.']
</code></pre>

<p>Only one thing left to explain - <code>re.DOTALL</code> makes <code>.</code> match newline as described <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/re.html#re.DOTALL" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You can try:</p>

<pre><code>p = open('a')
process = p.read()
print process
regexMatch = re.findall('[^.!?]+[.!?]',process)
print regexMatch
p.close()
</code></pre>

<p>The regex used here is <code>[^.!?]+[.!?]</code> which tries to match one or more non-sentence delimiter followed by a sentence delimiter.</p>
