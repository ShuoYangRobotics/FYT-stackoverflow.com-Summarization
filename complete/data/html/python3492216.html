<h3>Question (ID-3492216):</h3><h2>Why does updating a set in a tuple cause an error?</h2><p>I have just tried the following in Python 2.6:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; foo = (set(),)
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo[0] |= set(range(5))
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo
(set([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]),)
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo[0].update(set(range(10)))
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo
(set([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]),)
</code></pre>

<p>I have several questions here:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why does <code>foo[0] |= set(range(5))</code> update the set and throw an exception?</li>
<li>why does <code>foo[0].update(set(range(10)))</code> work without a problem? Should it not have the same result as the first statement?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> Many people have pointed out, that tuples are immutable. I am aware of that. They have also pointed out, that <code>|=</code> would create a new <code>set</code> object and assign it to the tuple. That is wrong. See this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; foo = set()
&gt;&gt;&gt; bar = foo
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo is bar
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo |= set(range(5))
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo
set([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
&gt;&gt;&gt; bar
set([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo is bar
True
</code></pre>

<p>This means that no new object has been created, but the existing one was modified. This should work with the tuple. Please note also that, although my first code throws a <code>TypeError</code>, the set within the tuple is still updated. That is the effect I am interested in. Why the <code>TypeError</code>, when the operation obviously was successful?</p>

<p>This shows that the statement <code>x[0] |= y</code> is implemented by calling <code>x[0].__ior__(y)</code> and then assigning the returned value to <code>x[0]</code>.</p>

<p><code>set</code> implements in-place <code>|=</code> by having <code>set.__ior__</code> return <code>self</code>.  However, the assignment to <code>x[0]</code> still takes place.  The fact that it's assigning the same value that was already there is irrelevant; it fails for the same reason that:</p>

<pre><code>x = (set(),)
x[0] = x[0]
</code></pre>

<p>fails.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><pre><code>foo[0] |= set(range(5)) 
</code></pre>

<p>doesn't work, because what you wanted to achieve is:</p>

<pre><code>foo[0] = foo[0] | set(range(5))
</code></pre>

<p>and you can't assign new elements to an old tuple, because they are immutable. For example you cant do this:</p>

<pre><code>x = (0, 1, 2)
x[0] = 3
</code></pre>

<p>When you are running update, you don't change references in the tuple, but only object behind the reference. You could also do this like this:</p>

<pre><code>x = set()
y = (x,)
x.update(set(range(5))
</code></pre>

<p>as you can see you don't change the tuple, but <code>x</code> (and <code>y[0]</code>) will be changed.</p>

<pre><code>x |= y
</code></pre>

<p>and </p>

<pre><code>x.update(y)
</code></pre>

<p>aren't the same, because <code>update</code> works in place and <code>x |= y</code> will create a new object <code>(x | y)</code> and store it under name <code>x</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>In your example <code>foo</code> is a tuple. <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#tuple" rel="nofollow">Tuples</a> in python are inmutable, this means that you cannot change the reference of any tuple element - <code>foo[0]</code> in your case. Things like the following can't be done:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = ('foo','bar')
&gt;&gt;&gt; x[0]='foo2'
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>You could use a <code>list</code> instead</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; foo = [set(),None]
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo
[set([]), None]
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo[0] |= set(range(5))
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo
[set([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]), None]
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Tuples are immutable. By trying to assign to <code>foo[0]</code>, you are attempting to change a value that the tuple stores (a reference to a set). When you use the <code>update()</code> function, you are not changing the reference, but instead the actual set. Because the reference is the same, this is allowed.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Tuples are immutable so u cannot reassign values to it. But if a tuple contains a mutable type such as list or set u can update them.
now in your case when u use '|=' u actually first update the set (which is a value in the tuple) then assign it to tuple which causes the exception. 
Exception is thrown after the updation of the set.</p>

<p>In the next case u r simply updating the set so there is no exception.

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><blockquote>
  <p>"Why the TypeError, when the operation obviously was successful?".  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because there are multiple side-effects.  Try to avoid that.</p>

<p>That's what the </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>foo[0] |= set(range(5)) update the set and throw an exception</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Correct.  First the set mutation is done.</p>

<p>Then the tuple mutation is attempted and fails.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>foo[0].update(set(range(10))) work without a problem? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Correct.  The set is mutated.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should it not have the same result as the first statement?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  The first statement involves explicit assignment -- changing the tuple -- which is forbidden.</p>

<p>The second statement updates a member of an immutable tuple, an operation that is not forbidden, but is suspicious as pushing the envelope.</p>

<p><strong>But</strong> the Legalism Scholar argues, aren't they supposed to be the same?  Or similar?  No.</p>

<p>Updating the tuple object (via assignment) is forbidden.</p>

<p>Updating a member of an existing tuple object (via a mutator function) is not forbidden.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>The best way to explain this is to show it "algebraically":</p>

<pre><code>foo[0] |= set(range(5))
foo[0] = set.__ior__(foo[0], set(range(5)))
tuple.__setitem__(foo, 0, set.__ior__(foo[0], set(range(5))))

foo[0].update(set(range(5)))
set.__ior__(foo[0], set(range(5)))
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the <code>update</code> form is not the same, it modifies <code>foo[0]</code> in place. <code>__or__</code> generates a new set from the elements of the left and right operands. This is then assigned back to <code>foo</code>.</p>

<p>Note that for simplicity, the expansions that aren't helpful to the problem are not expanded (such as <code>foo[0] -&gt; tuple.__getitem__(foo, 0)</code>).</p>

<p>The <code>TypeError</code> thrown is in <code>tuple.__setitem__</code>. <code>tuple</code> does not allow its items references to be replaced. The <code>update</code> form does not touch <code>foo</code> in any way (ie. it doesn't not invoke <code>tuple.__setitem__</code>).</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><ol>
<li><code>a |= b</code> is equivalent to <code>a = operator.ior(a, b)</code>.</li>
<li><code>s[i] |= b</code> is equivalent to <code>s[i] = operator.ior(s[i], b)</code>.</li>
<li>Item assignment on a tuple is forbidden by contract.</li>
<li>The <code>set.__ior__</code> method calls <code>set.update</code> without creating a new instance.</li>
</ol>

<p>That explains the behaviour you are observing.</p>

<p>The underlying problem, is that changing the value of a tuple is a violation of contract. You should not try doing it. Since you can have any object in a tuple, there are loopholes you can exploit, but then you get the kind of weird behaviour you are observing.</p>

<p>Tuple items should be <code>frozenset</code> instead of <code>set</code>. If you do this, you will get a consistent behaviour, and no unwanted side-effect on error.</p>
