<h3>Question (ID-1639976):</h3><h2>Understanding a factorial function in python</h2><p>I'm trying to understand if the following Python function:</p>

<pre><code>def factorial(i):
    if not hasattr(factorial, 'lstFactorial'):
        factorial.lstFactorial = [None] * 1000
    if factorial.lstFactorial[i] is None:
        iProduct = 1
        for iFactor in xrange(1, i+1):
            iProduct *= iFactor
        factorial.lstFactorial[i] = iProduct
    return factorial.lstFactorial[i]
</code></pre>

<p>would produce the same results as the equivalent in C#:</p>

<pre><code>long factorial(long n) 
{ 
   return n &lt;= 1 ? 1 : n * factorial(n-1);
}
</code></pre>

<p>for a value of 12 or less.</p>

<p>I know nothing about Python but have just converted some Python code to C#. This was the only function that I didn't fully understand.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>here is main algorithm</p>

<pre><code>iProduct = 1
for iFactor in xrange(1, i+1):
    iProduct *= iFactor
</code></pre>

<p>other code is for caching results.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Even without knowing Python, it must be clear to you that the two functions are far from identical. The C# version is calculating the factorial via recursion, whereas the Python one is doing it via iteration (although in a slightly weird way, with some odd memoization/caching going on - I guess in case you want to calculate multiple factorials in the lifetime of a program).</p>

<p>Anyway, since calculating a factorial is a very simple algorithm, it works out the same in both cases. </p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>IANAPG (Python Guru), but it looks to me like the function is creating a static array of 1000 entries, then filling them on an as-needed basis to prevent recalculation. In C++, it'd be something like:</p>

<pre><code>long factorial(int i){
    //Cache array
    static long factorials[1000];
    if (!factorials[i]){ //If not cached, calculate &amp; store
        int product = 1;
        for (int idx = 1; idx &lt;= i + 1; ++idx){
            product *= idx;
        }
        factorials[i] = product;
    }
    return factorials[i]; //Return cached value
}
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>it will return the same results, but the Python version will probably have better performance, because it memoizes the results</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>It just attaches an attribute called <code>lstFactorial</code> to <code>factorial</code>. This attribute is a list of 1000 values used to cache the results of previous calls.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p></p>

<pre><code>def factorial(i):
    if not hasattr(factorial, 'lstFactorial'): #program checks whether caching list exists
        factorial.lstFactorial = [None] * 1000 #if so, it creates a list of thousand None elements (it is more or less equivalent to C/C++'s NULL
    if factorial.lstFactorial[i] is None: #prog checks if that factorial has been already calculated
        iProduct = 1 #set result to 1
        for iFactor in xrange(1, i+1): # C's for(iFactor = 1; iFactor &amp;lt;= i+1; iFactor++)
            iProduct *= iFactor #we multiply result times current loop counter
        factorial.lstFactorial[i] = iProduct #and put result in caching list
    return factorial.lstFactorial[i] #after all, we return the result, calculated jest now or obtained from cache
</code></pre>

<p>To be honest, it is not the best algorithm, since it uses cache only partially.</p>

<p>The simple, user-friendly factorial function (no caching) would be:</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>def factorial(i):
    if i == 0 or i == 1:
        return 1
    return i*factorial(i-1)
</code></pre>

<p>Of for lazy python programmers, most similiar to that C# example:</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>f = lambda i: i and i*f(i-1) or 1
</code></pre>
