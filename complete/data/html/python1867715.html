<h3>Question (ID-1867715):</h3><h2>Iteration in a single line</h2><p>I have some code of the form:</p>

<pre><code>for i in range(nIterations):
    y = f(y)
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>f</code> is a function defined elsewhere. hopefully the idea of that code is that after it's run <code>y</code> will have had  <code>f</code> applied to it <code>nIterations</code> times.</p>

<p>Is there a way in python to write this in a single line?</p>

<pre><code>for i in range(nIterations): y = f(y)
</code></pre>

<p>A for loop with one command can be written as a single line.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Or maybe slightly cleaner:</p>

<pre><code>for _ in xrange(nIterations): y = f(y)
</code></pre>

<p>Since you don't want to have a something that can be split into two separate statements (i think), here's another one:</p>

<pre><code>reduce(lambda y, _: f(y), xrange(nIterations), initValue)
</code></pre>

<p>Still, I would recommend to <strong>just use your original code</strong>, which is much more intuitive and readable. Also note what <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=211200" rel="nofollow">Guido van Rossum</a> has to say on loops versus <code>repeat</code>.
Note by the way that (in python 2.x) <code>xrange</code> is more efficient than <code>range</code> for large nIterations as it returns an actual iterator and not an allocated list.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>So like this you mean?  </p>

<pre><code>for i in range(nIterations): y = f(y)
</code></pre>

<p>While this might seem nice and pretty, I'd argue (as has been done in the comments below your post) that this <strong>doesn't</strong> improve readability, and is best off left as 2 lines.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Just stick it all on one line like this: <code>for i in range(nIterations): y = f(y)</code></p>

<p>The decision to have code on one line or multiple has been an argument for years - there is no performance increase - just lay it out how you like it and how <strong>you</strong> can read it best.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Your question lacks context, but this could be rewritten using <code>map</code> function or list comprehension (both one-liners)</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Not exactly one line, but once you define the power operation for functions:</p>

<pre><code>def f_pow(f, n):
  if n == 1:
    return f
  else:
    return lambda x: f_pow(f, n-1)(f(x))
</code></pre>

<p>you can write this:</p>

<pre><code>f_pow(f, nIterations)(y)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p><code>reduce(lambda y,_: f(y),xrange(niterations),y)</code></p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Ok this is probably a very weird an incomprehensible use of the <code>reduce</code> function, so for real code I'd stick with what you have. But just for the fun of it, here goes:</p>

<pre><code>reduce(lambda a, b: f(a), range(nIterations), y)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>If you make <code>y</code> mutable, then you can use list comprehension. But this isn't something I'd use in real code, unless <strong>really</strong> necessary.</p>

<pre><code>def f(y):
    y[0] += 5

y = [0]
[f(y) for _ in xrange(10)]
print y[0] # =&gt; 50
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>While I'd suggest you keep the original code snippet as it is much clearer, you can accomplish this with a single line of code using the reduce function:</p>

<pre><code>reduce(lambda a,b: f(a), xrange(nIterations), y)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>You can create such snippets using semicolons <strong>;</strong> if you need to execute more than one instruction inside the loop, here is an example:</p>

<pre><code>for i in xrange(nIterations): x=f(i); y=f(x); z=f(y)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#10</b><br /><p>y=[f(y) for i in range(niteration)]</p>

<p>hope that helps ;)</p>
