<h3>Question (ID-1279613):</h3><h2>What is an ORM and where can I learn more about it?</h2><p>Someone suggested I use an ORM for a project I'm designing but I'm having trouble finding information on what it is or how it works. Can anyone give me a brief explanation or a link as to where I can learn more about it?</p>

<p>An ORM (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational%5Fmapping" rel="nofollow">Object-Relational Mapping</a>) is a tool that let you query and manipulate data from a database using an object paradigm.</p>

<p>It's a completely ordinary library written in your language that encapsulates the code needed to manipulate the data, so you don't use SQL anymore, but directly an object of you language.</p>

<p>E.G, a completely imaginary case with a pseudo language :</p>

<p>You have a book class, you want to retrieve all the books of which the author is "Linus". Manually, you would do something like that :</p>

<pre><code>book_list = new List();
sql = "SELECT book FROM library WHERE author = 'Linus'";
data = query(sql); // I over simplify ...
while (row = data.next())
{
     book = new Book();
     book.setAuthor(row.get('author');
     book_list.add(book);
}
</code></pre>

<p>With an ORM, it would look like that :</p>

<pre><code>book_list = BookTable.query(author="Linus");
</code></pre>

<p>The mechanical part is taken care automatically by the ORM.</p>

<h2>Pros and cons</h2>

<p><strong>Using an ORM save a lot of time because :</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t%5Frepeat%5Fyourself" rel="nofollow">DRY</a> : You write your data model in only one place, it's easier to update, maintain and reuse the code.</li>
<li>A lot of stuff is done automatically, from the database handling to I18N.</li>
<li>It forces you to write <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller" rel="nofollow">MVC</a> code, and in the end your app is cleaner.</li>
<li>You don't have to write poorly formed SQL (most Web programmers really suck at it, because SQL is treated like a "sub" language whereas it's a very powerful and complex one)</li>
<li>Sanitizing, using prepared statements or transactions are as easy as calling a method.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Using an ORM is more flexible because :</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>It fits in your natural way of coding (it's your language !)</li>
<li>It abstracts the DB system, so you can change it whenever you want.</li>
<li>The model is weakly binded to the rest of the app, so you can change it or use it anywhere else.</li>
<li>It let you use OOP goodness like data inheritance without head ache.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>But ORM can be a pain :</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>You have to learn it, and they are not lightweight tools;</li>
<li>You have to set it up. Same problem.</li>
<li>Performances are ok for usual queries, but a SQL master will always do better with his little hands for the big dirty works.</li>
<li>It abstracts the DB. While it's ok if you know what's happening behind the scene, it's a trap for the noobs that can write very greedy statements, like a heavy hit in a <em>for</em> loop...</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to learn about them ?</h2>

<p>Well, use one. What ever the one you choose, they all use the same principles.  There are a lot of ORM around here :</p>

<ul>
<li>Java : <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibernate%5F%28Java%29" rel="nofollow">Hibernate</a>.</li>
<li>PHP : <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propel%5F%28PHP%29" rel="nofollow">Propel</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctrine%5F%28PHP%29" rel="nofollow">Doctrine</a> (I prefer the last one).</li>
<li>Python : the Django ORM or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLAlchemy" rel="nofollow">SQLAlchemy</a> (The last one is my favorite ORM ever).</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to try an ORM in Web programming, you'd better use directly an entire framework stack like :</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symfony" rel="nofollow">Symfony</a> (PHP, using Propel or Doctrine)</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django%5F%28web%5Fframework%29" rel="nofollow">Django</a> (Python, using a internal ORM)</li>
</ul>

<p>Do not try to write you own ORM, unless to learn something. This is a gigantic piece of work, and the old ones took a lot of time before becoming reliable.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>An ORM (Object Relational Mapper) is a piece/layer of software that helps map your code Objects to your database.</p>

<p>Some handle more aspects than others...but the purpose is to take some of the weight of the Data Layer off of the developer's shoulders.</p>

<p>Here's a brief clip from Martin Fowler (Data Mapper):</p>

<p><a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/dataMapper.html" rel="nofollow">Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture Data Mappers</a></p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Like all acronyms it's ambiguous, but I assume they mean <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational%5Fmapping" rel="nofollow">object-relational mapper</a> -- a way to cover your eyes and make believe there's no SQL underneath, but rather it's all objects;-). Not really true, of course, and not without problems -- the always colorful Jeff Atwood has described ORM as <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000621.html" rel="nofollow">the Vietnam of CS</a>;-). But, if you know little or no SQL, and have a pretty simple / small-scale problem, they can save you time!-)</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The first chapter of the Hibernate book <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1932394885" rel="nofollow">Java Persistence with Hibernate (3rd ed.)</a> has an excellent overview of general ORM concepts and discusses motivation and design of ORMs. Highly recommended, even if you don't work with Java.</p>

  <p><em>Can anyone give me a brief explanation...</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure.</p>

<p>ORM stands for  "Object to Relational Mapping" where </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>Object</strong> part is the one you use with your programming language ( python in this case ) </p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Relational</strong> part is a Relational Database Manager System ( A database that is ) there are other types of databases but the most popular is relational ( you know tables, columns, pk fk etc eg Oracle MySQL, MS-SQL ) </p></li>
<li><p>And finally the <strong>Mapping</strong> part is where you do a bridge between your objects and your tables. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>In applications where you don't use a ORM framework you do this by hand. Using an ORM framework would allow you do reduce the boilerplate needed to create the solution.</p>

<p>So let's say you have this object.</p>

<pre><code> class Employee:
      def __init__( self, name ): 
          self.__name = name

       def getName( self ):
           return self.__name

       #etc.
</code></pre>

<p>and the table</p>

<pre><code>   create table employee(
          name varcar(10),
          -- etc  
    )
</code></pre>

<p>Using an ORM framework would allow you to map that object with a db record automagically and write something like:</p>

<pre><code>   emp = Employee("Ryan")

   orm.save( emp )
</code></pre>

<p>And have the employee inserted into the DB.</p>
