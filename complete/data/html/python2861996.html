<h3>Question (ID-2861996):</h3><h2>How do I get the Math equation of Python Algorithm?</h2><p>ok so I am feeling a little stupid for not knowing this, but a coworker asked so I am asking here: I have written a python algorithm that solves his problem. given x > 0 add all numbers together from 1 to x.</p>

<pre><code>def intsum(x):
  if x &gt; 0:
    return x + intsum(x - 1)
  else:
    return 0

intsum(10)
55
</code></pre>

<p>first what is this type of equation is this and what is the correct way to get this answer as it is clearly easier using some other method?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>This is recursion, though for some reason you're labeling it like it's factorial.</p>

<p>In any case, the sum from 1 to n is also simply:  </p>

<p><code>n * ( n + 1 ) / 2</code></p>

<p>(You can special case it for negative values if you like.)</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Transforming recursively-defined sequences of integers into ones that can be expressed in a closed form is a fascinating part of discrete mathematics -- I heartily recommend <strong>Concrete Mathematics: A Foundation for Computer Science</strong>, by Ronald Graham, Donald Knuth, and Oren Patashnik (see. e.g. the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_Mathematics" rel="nofollow">wikipedia</a> entry about it).</p>

<p>However, the specific sequence you show, <code>fac(x) = fac(x - 1) + x</code>, according to a famous anecdote, was solved by Gauss when he was a child in first grade -- the teacher had given the pupils the taksk of summing numbers from 1 to 100 to keep them quet for a while, but two minutes later there was young Gauss with the answer, 5050, and the explanation: "I noticed that I can sum the first, 1, and the last, 100, that's 101; and the second, 2, and the next-to-last, 99, and that's again 101; and clearly that repeats 50 times, so, 50 times 101, 5050".  Not rigorous as proofs go, but quite correct and appropriate for a 6-years-old;-).</p>

<p>In the same way (plus really elementary algebra) you can see that the general case is, as many have already said, <code>(N * (N+1)) / 2</code> (the product is always even, since one of the numbers must be odd and one even; so the division by two will always produce an integer, as desired, with no remainder).</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Here is how to prove the closed form for an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression" rel="nofollow">arithmetic progression</a></p>

<pre><code>S  = 1 +   2   + ... + (n-1) + n
S  = n + (n-1) + ... +   2   + 1
2S = (n+1) + (n+1) + ... + (n+1) + (n+1)
     ^ you'll note that there are n terms there.
2S = n(n+1)
S = n(n+1)/2

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Larry is very correct with his formula, and its the fastest way to calculate the sum of all integers up to <code>n</code>.</p>

<p>But for completeness, there are built-in Python functions, that perform what you have done, on lists with <em>arbitrary</em> elements. E.g.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#sum" rel="nofollow"><code>sum()</code></a></p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; sum(range(11))
55
&gt;&gt;&gt; sum([2,4,6])
12
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>or more general, <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#reduce" rel="nofollow"><code>reduce()</code></a></p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import operator
&gt;&gt;&gt; reduce(operator.add, range(11))
55
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I'm not allowed to comment yet so I'll just add that you'll want to be careful in using range() as it's 0 base. You'll need to use range(n+1) to get the desired effect.</p>

<p>Sorry for the duplication...</p>

<p>sum(range(10)) != 55</p>

<p>sum(range(11)) == 55</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>OP has asked, in a comment, for a link to the story about Gauss as a schoolchild.</p>

<p>He may want to check out <a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/gausss-day-of-reckoning" rel="nofollow">this fascinating article by Brian Hayes</a>.  It not only rather convincingly suggests that the Gauss story may be a modern fabrication, but outlines how it would be rather difficult not to see the patterns involved in summing the numbers from 1 to 100.  That in fact the only way to miss these patterns would be to solve the problem by writing a program.</p>

<p>The article also talks about different ways to sum arithmetic progressions, which is at the heart of OP's question.  There is also an ad-free version <a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/id.3483,y.0,no.,content.true,page.1,css.print/issue.aspx" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Consider that N+1, N-1+2, N-2+3, and so on all add up to the same number, and there are approximately N/2 instances like that (exactly N/2 if N is even).</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>What you have there is called arithmetic sequence and as suggested, you can compute it directly without overhead which might result from the recursion.</p>

<p>And I would say this is a homework despite what you say.</p>
