<h3>Question (ID-895420):</h3><h2>Using python to develop web application</h2><p>I have been doing some work in python, but that was all for stand alone applications. I'm curious to know whether any offshoot of python supports web development?</p>

<p>Would some one also suggest a good tutorial or a website from where I can pick up some of the basics of web development using python?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-9):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Now that everyone has said <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/" rel="nofollow">Django</a>, I can add my two cents: I would argue that you might learn more by looking at the different components first, before using Django. For web development with Python, you often want 3 components:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Something that takes care
of the HTTP stuff (e.g.
<a href="http://www.cherrypy.org/" rel="nofollow">CherryPy</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>A templating language
to create your web pages.
<a href="http://www.makotemplates.org/" rel="nofollow">Mako</a>
is very pythonic and <a href="http://www.cherrypy.org/wiki/intro/1" rel="nofollow">works</a> with Cherrpy.</p></li>
<li><p>If you get your data from a
database, an ORM comes in handy.
<a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/" rel="nofollow">SQLAlchemy</a>
would be an <a href="http://code.google.com/p/webpyte/source/browse/trunk/webpyte/sqlalchemy%5Ftool.py" rel="nofollow">example</a>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>All the links above have good tutorials. For many real-world use-cases, Django will be a better solution than such a stack as it seamlessly integrates this functionality (and more). And if you need a CMS, Django is your best bet short of Zope. Nevertheless, to get a good grasp of what's going on, a stack of loosely coupled programs might be better. Django hides a lot of the details.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/WebFrameworks" rel="nofollow">Python Wiki: Web Frameworks for Python</a></p>

<p>If you decide to use <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/" rel="nofollow">Django</a>, <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/" rel="nofollow">the official tutorial</a> is an excellent place to start. <a href="http://www.djangobook.com/" rel="nofollow">The Django Book</a> is also free.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If you really don't want to delve into the frameworks - and you should, I heartily recommend Django or Pylons - there's still need to go down the road of CGI. This is a totally out-of-date technology, not to mention slow and inefficient.</p>

<p>There <em>is</em> a standard way of building Python web applications, and it's called <a href="http://www.wsgi.org/" rel="nofollow">WSGI</a>. If you want to roll your own web app from scratch, this is absolutely the way to go.</p>

<p>That said, if you're just starting out, really you should go with one of the frameworks.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Don't lookup Django until you have a good grasp of what Django is doing on your behalf. for you. Write some basic apps using mod_python and it's request object. I just started learning Python for web-development using mod_python and it has been great.</p>

<p>mod_python also uses a dispatcher in site-packages/mod_python/publisher.py. Have a ganders through this to see how requests can be handled in a simple-ish way.</p>

<p>You may need to add a bit of config to your Apache config file to get mod_python up and running but the mod_python site explains it well.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Directory /path/to/python/files&gt;
     AddHandler mod_python .py
     PythonHandler mod_python.publisher
     PythonDebug On
&lt;/Directory&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And you are away!</p>

<p>use (as a stupidly basic example):</p>

<pre><code>def foo(req):
    req.write("Hello World")
</code></pre>

<p>in <code>/path/to/python/files/bar.py</code> assuming <code>/path/to</code> is your site root.</p>

<p>And then you can do </p>

<pre><code>http://www.mysite.com/python/files/bar/foo
</code></pre>

<p>to see "Hello World". Also, something that <strong>tripped me up</strong> is the dispatcher uses a lame method to work out the content-type, so to force HTML use:</p>

<pre><code>req.content_type = 'text/html'
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Good Luck</strong></p>

<p>After you have a good idea of how Python interacts with mod_python and Apache, then use a framework that does all the boring stuff for you. Up to you though, just my recommendation</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>There are a couple of choices for web development. From my experience, your choice will again be dependent on your application. I used <a href="http://djangoproject.com" rel="nofollow">django</a> and <a href="http://webpy.org/" rel="nofollow">web.py</a> in production and I am about to deploy an app based on <a href="http://pylonshq.com/" rel="nofollow">pylons</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://djangoproject.com" rel="nofollow">Django</a> hides a lot of choices (comes with its ORM and templating). The documentation is extensive and well-written. There are many reusable app available for django, but you will likely to invest a little time in integrating them seamlessly. One thing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fipFKyW2FA4" rel="nofollow">mentioned on djangocon 08</a> was the fact, that there is cool stuff in django, which can't be easily
accessed in non-django projects.</p>

<p><a href="http://webpy.org/" rel="nofollow">web.py</a> impressed me by its raw simplicity. Before I knew it, I wrote a small app (<a href="http://myyn.org/localwiki" rel="nofollow">78 lines quasi-wiki</a>) in it. </p>

<p><a href="http://pylonshq.com/" rel="nofollow">pylons</a> feels like in the middle of both. I can use <a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/" rel="nofollow">sqlalchemy</a> and <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/2/" rel="nofollow">jinja</a>, all in all a pleasant experience for the start.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Lookup Django.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Python can be used for web development, but there isn't a special language extension or anything in the language that will handle all the HTML generation or that works like PHP.</p>

<p>It's pretty much run through some sort of interpreter on a web server (CGI, mod_python, etc.).</p>

<p>I would recommend looking into <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/WebFrameworks" rel="nofollow">Python Web Application Frameworks</a> or how to write <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/CgiScripts" rel="nofollow">Python CGI scripts</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>There are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison%5Fof%5Fweb%5Fapplication%5Fframeworks" rel="nofollow">quite a few</a> web frameworks for python out there, but the only one I've used is <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/" rel="nofollow">Django</a>, and I really like it.</p>

<p>If you've got a few hours, do the <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/install/" rel="nofollow">tutorial</a>, I promise you, you'll enjoy it :)</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>As others have mentioned, one of the more prominent python "offshoots" as you call them would be <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/" rel="nofollow">Django</a>.  It is a rather powerful framework that allows you to quickly and securely build web applications.  The first place to look would be <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/overview/#intro-overview" rel="nofollow">their overview</a> which gives some insight as to what Django does as a framework.</p>

<p>Going through <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/" rel="nofollow">their tutorial</a> taught me alot about the prominent Model-View-Controler design pattern and how it may be used in a web-development context.  I found it a great way to start writing an application that worked and learn by improving it.</p>
