<h3>Question (ID-1874592):</h3><h2>PEP8 - 80 Characters - Big Strings</h2><p>Due to the sheer annoyance of figuring out what to Google, I've decided to risk what any reputation I had to ask this rather simple question.</p>

<p>As PEP8 suggests keeping below the 80 column rule for your python program, how can I abide to that with long strings, i.e.</p>

<pre><code>s = "this is my really, really, really, really, really, really, really long string that I'd like to shorten."
</code></pre>

<p>How would I go about expanding this to the following line, i.e.</p>

<pre><code>s = "this is my really, really, really, really, really, really" + 
    "really long string that I'd like to shorten."
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Also, because neighboring string constants are automatically concatenated, you can code it like this too:</p>

<pre><code>s = ("this is my really, really, really, really, really, really, "  
     "really long string that I'd like to shorten.")
</code></pre>

<p>Note no plus sign, and I added the extra comma and space that follows the formatting of your example.</p>

<p>Personally I don't like the backslashes, and I recall reading somewhere that its use is actually deprecated in favor of this form which is more explicit. Remember "Explicit is better than implicit."</p>

<p>I consider the backslash to be less clear and less useful because this is actually escaping the newline character. It's not possible to put a line end comment after it if one should be necessary. It is possible to do this with concatenated string constants:</p>

<pre><code>s = ("this is my really, really, really, really, really, really, " # comments ok
     "really long string that I'd like to shorten.")
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>I used a Google search of "python line length" which returns the PEP8 link as the first result, but also links to another good StackOverflow post on this topic:</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/88942/why-should-python-pep-8-specify-a-maximum-line-length-of-79-characters">Why should Python PEP-8 specify a maximum line length of 79 characters?</a></p>

<p>Another good search phrase would be "python line continuation".</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Implicit concatenation might be the cleanest solution:</p>

<pre><code>s = "this is my really, really, really, really, really, really," \
    " really long string that I'd like to shorten."
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You lost a space, and you probably need a line continuation character, ie. a <code>\</code>.</p>

<pre><code>s = "this is my really, really, really, really, really, really" +  \
    " really long string that I'd like to shorten."
</code></pre>

<p>or even:</p>

<pre><code>s = "this is my really, really, really, really, really, really"  \
    " really long string that I'd like to shorten."
</code></pre>

<p>Parens would also work instead of the line continuation, but you risk someone thinking you intended to have a tuple and had just forgotten a comma.  Take for instance:</p>

<pre><code>s = ("this is my really, really, really, really, really, really"
    " really long string that I'd like to shorten.")
</code></pre>

<p>versus:</p>

<pre><code>s = ("this is my really, really, really, really, really, really",
    " really long string that I'd like to shorten.")
</code></pre>

<p>With Python's dynamic typing, the code may run either way, but produce incorrect results with the one you didn't intend.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Backslash:</p>

<pre><code>s = "this is my really, really, really, really, really, really" +  \
    "really long string that I'd like to shorten."
</code></pre>

<p>or wrap in parens:</p>

<pre><code>s = ("this is my really, really, really, really, really, really" + 
    "really long string that I'd like to shorten.")
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I think the most important word in your question was "suggests".  </p>

<p>Coding standards are funny things.  Often the guidance they provide has a really good basis when it was written (e.g. most terminals being unable to show > 80 characters on a line), but over time they become functionally obsolete, but still rigidly adhered to.  I guess what you need to do here is weigh up the relative merits of "breaking" that particular suggestion against the readability and mainatinability of your code.</p>

<p>Sorry this doesn't directly answer your question.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>With an \ you can expand statments to multiple lines</p>

<pre><code>s = "this is my really, really, really, really, really, really" + \
"really long string that I'd like to shorten."
</code></pre>

<p>should work.</p>
