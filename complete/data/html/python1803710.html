<h3>Question (ID-1803710):</h3><h2>Python: Can you make this __eq__ easy to understand?</h2><p>I have another question for you.</p>

<p>I have a python class with a list 'metainfo'. This list contains variable names that my class <em>might</em> contain. I wrote a <code>__eq__</code> method that returns True if the both <code>self</code> and <code>other</code> have the same variables from <code>metainfo</code> and those variables have the same value.</p>

<p>Here is my implementation:</p>

<pre><code> def __eq__(self, other):
    for attr in self.metainfo:
      try:
        ours = getattr(self, attr) 
        try:
          theirs = getattr(other, attr)
          if ours != theirs:
            return False
        except AttributeError:
          return False
      except AttributeError:
        try:
          theirs = getattr(other, attr)
          return False
        except AttributeError:
          pass
    return True
</code></pre>

<p>Does anyone have any suggestions as to how I can make this code easier on the eye? Be as ruthless as you please.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Use <a href="http://docs.python.org/3.1/library/functions.html#getattr" rel="nofollow"><code>getattr</code></a>'s third argument to set distinct default values:</p>

<pre><code>def __eq__(self, other):
    return all(getattr(self, a, Ellipsis) == getattr(other, a, Ellipsis)
               for a in self.metainfo)
</code></pre>

<p>As the default value, set something that will never be an actual value, such as <a href="http://docs.python.org/3.1/library/stdtypes.html#the-ellipsis-object" rel="nofollow"><code>Ellipsis</code></a><sup>&dagger;</sup>. Thus the values will match only if both objects contain the same value for a certain attribute <em>or</em> if both do not have said attribute.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: as <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/97828/nadia-alramli">Nadia</a> points out, <a href="http://docs.python.org/3.1/library/constants.html#NotImplemented" rel="nofollow"><code>NotImplemented</code></a> may be a more appropriate constant (unless you're storing the result of rich comparisons...).</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> Indeed, as <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/151238/lac">Lac</a> points out, just using <a href="http://docs.python.org/3.1/library/functions.html#hasattr" rel="nofollow"><code>hasattr</code></a> results in a more readable solution:</p>

<pre><code>def __eq__(self, other):
    return all(hasattr(self, a) == hasattr(other, a) and
               getattr(self, a) == getattr(other, a) for a in self.metainfo)
</code></pre>

<p><hr></p>

<p>&nbsp; <sup>&dagger;</sup>: for extra obscurity you could write <code>...</code> instead of <code>Ellipsis</code>, thus <code>getattr(self, a, ...)</code> etc. No, don't do it :)</p>

</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Going with <em>"Flat is better than nested"</em> I would remove the nested try statements. Instead, getattr should return a sentinel that only equals itself. Unlike Stephan202, however, I prefer to keep the for loop. I also would create a sentinel by myself, and not re-use some existing Python object. This guarantees that there are no false positives, even in the most exotic situations.</p>

<pre><code>def __eq__(self, other):
    sentinel = object() # sentinel == sentinel &lt;=&gt; sentinel is sentinel
    for attr in self.metainfo:
        if getattr(self, attr, sentinel) != getattr(other, attr, sentinel):
            return False
    return True
</code></pre>

<p>Also, the method should have a doc-string explaining it's <strong>eq</strong> behavior; same goes for the class which should have a docstring explaining the use of the metainfo attribute.</p>

<p>Finally, a unit-test for this equality-behavior should be present as well. Some interesting test cases would be:</p>

<ol>
<li>Objects that have the same content for all metainfo-attributes, but different content for some other attributes (=> they are equal)</li>
<li>If required, checking for commutativity of equals, i.e. if a == b: b == a</li>
<li>Objects that don't have any of the metainfo-attributes set</li>
</ol>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I would break the logic up into separate chunks that are easier to understand, each one checking a different condition (and each one assuming the previous thing was checked). Easiest just to show the code:</p>

<pre><code># First, check if we have the same list of variables.
my_vars = [var for var in self.metainf if hasattr(self, var)]
other_vars = [var for var in other.metainf if hasattr(other, var)]

if my_vars.sorted() != other_vars.sorted():
  return False # Don't even have the same variables.

# Now, check each variable:
for var in my_vars:
   if self.var != other.var:
      return False # We found a variable with a different value.

# We're here, which means we haven't found any problems!
return True
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I misunderstood the question, here is an updated version. I still think this is a clear way to write this kind of logic, but it's uglier than I intended and not at all efficient, so in this case I'd probably go with a different solution.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Here is a variant that is pretty easy to read IMO, without using sentinel objects. It will first compare if both has or hasnt the attribute, then compare the values.</p>

<p>It could be done in one line using all() and a generator expression as Stephen did, but I feel this is more readable.</p>

<pre><code>def __eq__(self, other):
    for a in self.metainfo:
        if hasattr(self, a) != hasattr(other, a):
             return False
        if getattr(self, a, None) != getattr(other, a, None):
             return False
    return True
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>The try/excepts make your code harder to read.  I'd use getattr with a default value that is guaranteed not to otherwise be there.  In the code below I just make a temp object.  That way if object do not have a given value they'll both return "NOT_PRESENT" and thus count as being equal.</p>

<pre><code>
def __eq__(self, other):
    NOT_PRESENT = object()
    for attr in self.metainfo:
        ours = getattr(self, attr, NOT_PRESENT) 
        theirs = getattr(other, attr, NOT_PRESENT)
        if ours != theirs:
            return False
    return True
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>I like Stephan202's answer, but I think that his code doesn't make equality conditions clear enough. Here's my take on it:</p>

<pre><code>def __eq__(self, other):
    wehave = [attr for attr in self.metainfo if hasattr(self, attr)]
    theyhave = [attr for attr in self.metainfo if hasattr(other, attr)]
    if wehave != theyhave:
        return False
    return all(getattr(self, attr) == getattr(other, attr) for attr in wehave)
