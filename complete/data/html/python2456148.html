<h3>Question (ID-2456148):</h3><h2>python print end=' '</h2><p>i have this python script where i need to run 'gdal_retile.py'</p>

<p>but i get this an exception on this line:</p>

<pre><code>if Verbose:
   print("Building internam Index for %d tile(s) ..." % len(inputTiles), end=' ')
</code></pre>

<p>the <code>end=''</code> is invalid syntax just curious as to why.. and what the author probably meant to do. </p>

<p>I'm new to python if you haven't already guessed.</p>

<p>Edit:
<em>Added the opening quote. that was just a typo</em>*</p>

<hr>

<p>I think the root cause of the problem is that these imports are failing
and therefore one must contain this import <code>from __future__ import print_function</code></p>

<pre><code>try: 
   from osgeo import gdal
   from osgeo import ogr
   from osgeo import osr
   from osgeo.gdalconst import *
except:
   import gdal
   import ogr
   import osr
   from gdalconst import *
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks all.</p>

<pre><code>#Only for use in Python 2.6.0a2 and later
from __future__ import print_function
</code></pre>

<p>This allows you to use the Python 3.0 style <code>print</code> function without having to hand-edit all occurrences of <code>print</code> :)</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>First of all, you're missing a quote at the beginning but this is probably a copy/paste error.</p>

<p>In Python 3.x, the <code>end=' '</code> part will place a space after the displayed string instead of a newline. To do the same thing in Python 2.x, you'd put a comma at the end:</p>

<pre><code>print "Building internam Index for %d tile(s) ..." % len(inputTiles),
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Are you sure you are using Python 3.x? The syntax isn't available in Python 2.x because <code>print</code> is still a statement.</p>

<p><code>print("foo" % bar, end=" ")</code></p>

<p>in Python 2.x is identical to</p>

<p><code>print ("foo" % bar, end=" ")</code></p>

<p>or</p>

<p><code>print "foo" % bar, end=" "</code></p>

<p>i.e. as a call to print with a tuple as argument.</p>

<p>That's obviously bad syntax (literals don't take keyword arguments). In Python 3.x <code>print</code> is an actual function, so it takes keyword arguments, too.</p>

<p>The correct idiom in Python 2.x for <code>end=" "</code> is:</p>

<p><code>print "foo" % bar,</code></p>

<p>(note the final comma, this makes it end the line with a space rather than a linebreak)</p>

<p>If you want more control over the output, consider using <code>sys.stdout</code> directly. This won't do any special magic with the output.</p>

<p>Of course in somewhat recent versions of Python 2.x (2.5 should have it, not sure about 2.4), you can use the <code>__future__</code> module to enable it in your script file:</p>

<p><code>from __future__ import print_function</code></p>

<p>The same goes with <code>unicode_literals</code> and some other nice things (<code>with_statement</code>, for example). This won't work in really old versions (i.e. created before the feature was introduced) of Python 2.x, though.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>It looks like you're just missing an opening double-quote.  Try:</p>

<pre><code>if Verbose:
   print("Building internam Index for %d tile(s) ..." % len(inputTiles), end=' ')
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I think the author probably meant:</p>

<pre><code>if Verbose:
   print("Building internam Index for %d tile(s) ..." % len(inputTiles), end=' ')
</code></pre>

<p>He's missing an initial quote after <code>print(</code>.</p>

<p>Note that as of <a href="http://docs.python.org/release/3.0.1/whatsnew/3.0.html#print-is-a-function" rel="nofollow">Python 3.0</a>, <code>print</code> is a function as opposed to a statement, if you're using older versions of Python the equivalent would be:</p>

<pre><code>print "Building internam Index for %d tile(s) ..." % len(inputTiles)
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>end</code> parameter means that the line gets <code>' '</code> at the end rather than a newline character. The equivalent in earlier versions of Python is:</p>

<pre><code>print "Building internam Index for %d tile(s) ..." % len(inputTiles),
</code></pre>

<p>(thanks Ignacio).</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I think he's using Python 3.0 and you're using Python 2.6.</p>
