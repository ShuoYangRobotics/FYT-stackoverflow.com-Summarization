<h3>Question (ID-1315559):</h3><h2>How good is startswith?</h2><p>Is  </p>

<p>Knowing text is not empty and we are only interested in the first character of it.  </p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-9):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p><code>text[0]</code> fails if <code>text</code> is an empty string:</p>

<pre><code>IronPython 2.6 Alpha (2.6.0.1) on .NET 4.0.20506.1
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; text = ""
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(text.startswith("a"))
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(text[0]=='a')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
IndexError: index out of range: 0
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: You say you "know" that <code>text</code> is not empty... how confident are you of that, and what would you want to happen if it <em>is</em> empty in reality? If a failure is appropriate (e.g. it means a bug in your code) that would encourage the use of <code>text[0]=='a'</code>.</p>

<p>Other questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How concerned are you about the performance of this? If this is performance critical, then benchmark it <em>on your particular Python runtime</em>. I wouldn't be <em>entirely</em> surprised to find that (say) one form was faster on IronPython and a different one faster on CPython.</p></li>
<li><p>Which do <em>you</em> (and your team) find more readable?</p></li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Yes: it’s easier to use and easier to read. When you are testing for more than one letter, when using slicing, you’ll have to know how long the target text is:</p>

<pre><code>haystack = 'Hello, World!'
needle = 'Hello'

# The easy way
result = haystack.startswith(needle)

# The slightly harder way
result = haystack[:len(needle)] == needle
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> The question seems to have changed. It now says, “knowing text is not empty and we are only interested in the first character of it.” That turns it into a fairly meaningless hypothetical situation.</p>

<p>I suspect the questioner is trying to “optimize” his/her code for execution speed. If that is the case, my answer is: don’t. Use whichever form is more <em>readable</em> and, therefore, more maintainable when you have to come back and work on it a year from now. Only optimize if profiling shows that line of code to be the bottleneck. This is not some O(n²) algorithm. It’s a string comparison.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Personally I would say <code>startswith</code> is more readable.</p>

<p>Also, from Python 2.5 <code>startwith</code> can take a tuple of prefixes to look for:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; "hello world".startswith(("hello","goodbye"))
True
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The stock phrase for the questiom is: "Premature optimization is the root of all evil".</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I'd agree with the others that startswith is more readable, and you should use that.  That said, if performance is a big issue for such a special case, benchmark it:</p>

<pre><code>$ python -m timeit -s 'text="foo"' 'text.startswith("a")'
1000000 loops, best of 3: 0.537 usec per loop

$ python -m timeit -s 'text="foo"' 'text[0]=="a"'
1000000 loops, best of 3: 0.22 usec per loop
</code></pre>

<p>So <code>text[0]</code> is amost 2.5 times as fast - but it's a pretty quick operation; you'd save ~0.3 microseconds per compare depending on the system.  Unless you're doing millions of comparisons in a time critical situation though, I'd still go with the more readable startswith.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p><code>text[0]</code> can fail but the equivalent <code>text[:1]</code> is safe if the string is empty.<br></p>

<p>If you want to compare more than one characters, I believe <code>.startswith()</code> is better.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Instead of asking you can just write a quick test and see which one's faster.<br />
And then let us know.<br />
Ofcourse you'll have to add to text[0] the check that the string isn't empty.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>text[0]=='a' is good considering performance. Also you need to add validation when you use this.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow">PEP 8</a> explicitly tells to use <code>startswith</code>, because of readability:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>- Use ''.startswith() and ''.endswith() instead of string
</code></pre>
  
  <p>slicing to check
        for prefixes or suffixes.</p>

<pre><code>  startswith() and endswith() are cleaner and less error prone.  For
  example:

    Yes: if foo.startswith('bar'):

    No:  if foo[:3] == 'bar':
</code></pre>
