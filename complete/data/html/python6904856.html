<h3>Question (ID-6904856):</h3><h2>Why doesn't this assign a copy</h2><p>I have the following code and I'm wondering why it returns the same list instead of a copy:</p>

<pre><code>x = [2,1,3]
y = x
y.sort()
print y
print x
</code></pre>

<p>Why does this return the same sorted list?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Because it's modified in-place.</p>

<p>Python lists have reference semantics, meaning that when you assign a list to another variable, they're actually pointing at the same list.</p>

<p>If you want to make a copy, do this:</p>

<pre><code>x = [2,1,3]
y = x[:]
y.sort()
print y
print x
</code></pre>

<p>The <em>slice</em> notation does cause the list (in this case, the entire list, though you can make a small modification to ask for a particular sublist) to be copied.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You are dealing with <em>references</em> in Python. The statement <code>y = x</code> makes <code>y</code> point to the same thing as <code>x</code>, so changes to <code>y</code> are reflected in <code>x</code> (because they point to the same underlying list).</p>

<p>You can change a copy by doing:</p>

<pre><code>y = list(x) # make a copy of the list so we can change y without disturbing x
y.sort()
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>y = sorted(x) # return a new sorted copy of what is in x
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>x is the name of ("reference to") the list (object). The line</p>

<pre><code>y=x
</code></pre>

<p>merely makes y another name for the same list. If you want to copy the list, use one of</p>

<pre><code>y = x[:]
y = list(x)
</code></pre>

<p>(The first syntax is just an ordinary list slice, but with both the start and the end values left out, meaning that it takes the entire list.)</p>

<p>Note that a list is a list of objects, and copying the list will not copy the objects. If you want that behaviour — a <em>deep</em> copy — you must do so explicitly with</p>

<pre><code>import copy
y = copy.deepcopy(x)
</code></pre>

<p>Naturally, this will be slower.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Assigning a list to another variable in Python creates a reference, so any changes you make to the reference will show up in the original. If you want a copy that will not alter the original, do this:</p>

<pre><code>y = x[:]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Because you only copy the reference.</p>

<p>For instruction on how to clone the list ('deep copy'),see:

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>When you say <code>y = x</code>, you're really just assigning another name (y) to the contents of x. If x is a mutable value and you do something to change it, you change the one-and-only copy that has 2 different names.</p>

<p>A common way to prevent this is to assign to a slice, which is always a copy of the original list.</p>

<pre><code>y = x[:]
</code></pre>
