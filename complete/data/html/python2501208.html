<h3>Question (ID-2501208):</h3><h2>Copying and pasting code into the Python interpreter</h2><p>There is a snippet of code that I would like to copy and paste into my Python interpreter. Unfortunately due to Python's sensitivity to whitespace it is not straightforward to copy and paste it a way that makes sense. (I think the whitespace gets mangled) Is there a better way? Maybe I can load the snippet from a file. </p>

<p>This is just an small example but if there is a lot of code I would like to avoid typing everything from the definition of the function or copy and pasting line by line. </p>

<pre><code>class bcolors: 
    HEADER = '\033[95m' 
    OKBLUE = '\033[94m' 
    OKGREEN = '\033[92m' 
    WARNING = '\033[93m' 
    FAIL = '\033[91m' 
    ENDC = '\033[0m' 

    def disable(self):  
        self.HEADER = '' # I think stuff gets mangled because of the extra level of indentation 
        self.OKBLUE = '' 
        self.OKGREEN = '' 
        self.WARNING = '' 
        self.FAIL = '' 
        self.ENDC = ''
</code></pre>

<p>For instance, create a file named "bgcolors.py" and copy and paste your code inside. Then using the python interpreter, you just type "import bgcolors" and you should be able to run it.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You can use <a href="http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/" rel="nofollow">IPython</a> which is much better python repl. It has command for getting input from <a href="http://ipython.scipy.org/doc/rel-0.9.1/html/interactive/tutorial.html#source-code-handling-tips" rel="nofollow">external editor</a> by using %edit command. </p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You can usually easily and safely do copy-pasting with <a href="http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/" rel="nofollow">IPython</a>, through the commands <code>%cpaste</code> and <code>%paste</code>.  This is very handy for testing code that you copy from web pages, for instance, or from your editor.  IPython also has a <code>%run</code> command that runs a program and leaves you in a Python shell with all the variables that were defined in the program, so that you can play with them.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/idle.html" rel="nofollow">IDLE</a> interface does go to effort to preserve the proper indentation of pasted text. </p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You can call execfile(filename). More or less the same as importing a module, except that it skips the module administration part and doesn't require you to add a folder to sys.path.</p>

<p>EDIT: To address the original question: copy-pasted code can be executed by calling exec(codestring).</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p><a href="http://dreampie.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">Dreampie</a> allows you to copy and paste code with proper indentation.</p>
