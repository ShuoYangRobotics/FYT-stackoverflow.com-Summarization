<h3>Question (ID-3105495):</h3><h2>Django form is throwing error: "takes exactly 1 argument (0 given)"</h2><p>I'm working on a basic event form created from a model, but I keep getting the following error message:</p>

<pre><code>TypeError at /addlaundry/
addlaundry() takes exactly 1 argument (0 given)
</code></pre>

<p>I think it's because I'm not passing the argument through on views, but I can't find documented anywhere how to do this right, at least not written in a way I understand.</p>

<p>Here is my urls.py:</p>

<pre><code>urlpatterns = patterns('',
    url('^addlaundry/$', 'beacon.laundry.views.addlaundry'),
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the views itself:</p>

<pre><code># Create your views here.

from schedule.views import EventForm

def addlaundry(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = EventForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            return HttpResponseRedirect('/thanks/') #redirect after succesfully adding new delivery
    else:
     form = addlaundry()

    return render_to_response('newlaundry.html', {
        'form': form,
    })
</code></pre>

<p>Do I indeed have my views wrongly structured, or am I missing something else? If there's documentation I need to read up on, I want to I just haven't found it but feel like I'm missing something basic.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Michael</p>

<pre><code>form = addlaundry()
</code></pre>

<p>You're calling your view function <code>addlaundry</code> which takes 1 required argument (<code>request</code>), but you're not passing it any arguments.</p>

<p>Of course, that's not the right way to construct a form, anyway. You'll want to take a look at the examples given in the <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.1/topics/forms/#topics-forms-index" rel="nofollow">Django forms documentation</a> to see how to create and use forms in Django.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Your view is called <code>addlaundry</code>, and it calls (presumably) something else called <code>addlaundry</code>. Rename one of them, or use the other <code>addlaundry</code> from inside its namespace.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>This is your problem:</p>

<pre><code> form = addlaundry()
</code></pre>

<p>That's attempting to call the view itself! That's not what you want. You need to define a form class and call (instantiate) it here.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>views.py :  </p>

<pre><code>from schedule.forms import EventForm

def addlaundry(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = EventForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            return HttpResponseRedirect('/thanks/')
    else:
        form = EventForm()

    return render_to_response('newlaundry.html', {
        'form': form,
    })
</code></pre>

<p><strong>That means :</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>using a forms.py file to define your forms</li>
<li>initializing your form in a non post context (regular first page load), that will be passed to your template</li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Also, in urls.py your view should not be a string.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><pre><code>else:
 form = addlaundry()
</code></pre>

<p>Just as the exception says: The view function needs 1 argument, but you didn't supply any.</p>
