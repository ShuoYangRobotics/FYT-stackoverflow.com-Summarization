<h3>Question (ID-2485466):</h3><h2>So, I guess I can't use "&&" in the Python if conditional. What should I use in this case? Any help?</h2><p>Here's my code:</p>

<pre><code># F. front_back
# Consider dividing a string into two halves.
# If the length is even, the front and back halves are the same length.
# If the length is odd, we'll say that the extra char goes in the front half.
# e.g. 'abcde', the front half is 'abc', the back half 'de'.
# Given 2 strings, a and b, return a string of the form
#  a-front + b-front + a-back + b-back
def front_back(a, b):
  # +++your code here+++
  if len(a) % 2 == 0 &amp;&amp; len(b) % 2 == 0:
    return a[:(len(a)/2)] + b[:(len(b)/2)] + a[(len(a)/2):] + b[(len(b)/2):] 
  else:
    #todo! Not yet done. :P
  return
</code></pre>

<p>I'm getting an error in the IF conditional. What am I doing wrong?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
I meant no arrogance here. Someone edited my question title to make it sound douchy. I was genuinely confused about what to use, didn't think 'and' would be a keyword. Please don't downvote as other newbies might be confused about it as well.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Two comments:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> for logical operations in Python.</li>
<li>Use 4 spaces to indent instead of 2.  You will thank yourself later because your code will look pretty much the same as everyone else's code.  See <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow">PEP 8</a> for more details.</li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Python uses <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> conditionals.</p>

<p>i.e.</p>

<pre><code>if foo == 'abc' and bar == 'bac' or zoo == '123'
  # do something
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I am a bit of a newbie with Python myself...  You should definitely take a look into <a href="http://diveintopython.org/" rel="nofollow">http://diveintopython.org/</a>. </p>

<p><a href="http://diveintopython.org/power_of_introspection/and_or.html" rel="nofollow">Here is the and-or chapter</a>.  </p>

<p>It's one of the better written "introduction books" I've read, doesn't assume you are a master programmer (but doesn't assume you know nothing about programming either)</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Probably this is not best code for this task, but is working -</p>

<pre><code>def front_back(a, b):

 if len(a) % 2 == 0 and len(b) % 2 == 0:
    print a[:(len(a)/2)] + b[:(len(b)/2)] + a[(len(a)/2):] + b[(len(b)/2):]

 elif len(a) % 2 == 1 and len(b) % 2 == 0:
    print a[:(len(a)/2)+1] + b[:(len(b)/2)] + a[(len(a)/2)+1:] + b[(len(b)/2):] 

 elif len(a) % 2 == 0 and len(b) % 2 == 1:
     print a[:(len(a)/2)] + b[:(len(b)/2)+1] + a[(len(a)/2):] + b[(len(b)/2)+1:] 

 else :
     print a[:(len(a)/2)+1] + b[:(len(b)/2)+1] + a[(len(a)/2)+1:] + b[(len(b)/2)+1:]

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>In python, like in C, boolean and bitwise operations are separate, but the boolean operators are spelled differently.</p>

<p>The boolean ones are spelled <code>and</code> and <code>or</code>. They have two advantages: they can work for any type of operands (types/classes that define how to be interpreted in a boolean context, i.e. have a <code>__nonzero__</code> special method), and they take a shortcut if they can. For example, <code>1 or lengthy_operation()</code> will never call the lengthy operation.</p>

<p>The bitwise operators (<code>&amp;</code>/and, <code>|</code>/or and <code>^</code>/xor) have the same meaning as in C, but they work only on integers (or other classes convertable to integer), and they don't short-circuit. Although not advisable, should you prefer to use the bitwise operators as boolean, make sure you use parentheses around the boolean terms, and that they are indeed boolean:</p>

<pre><code>if (len(a) % 2 == 0) &amp; (len(b) % 2 == 0):
</code></pre>
