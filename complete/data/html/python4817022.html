<h3>Question (ID-4817022):</h3><h2>Cleanest design pattern for displaying form data and validation errors?</h2><p>In real-life applications, if I use a form framework, I inevitably end up fighting it at some point.</p>

<p>I'm interested in best practice patterns for building forms in a website.  Reference to implementations in any language would be a bonus (I usually work in Python).  I'm particularly interested in the problem of creating / displaying the forms to the end user.</p>

<p>Here's how I see the subject. Most parts of the form workflow can be handled with relatively lightweight components that I can pull out of frameworks like <a href="http://formencode.org/" rel="nofollow">formencode</a> and <a href="http://ish.io/projects/show/formish" rel="nofollow">formish</a>.  By "most parts" I mean <strong>decoding</strong> submitted form data into a sensible data structure (e.g. repeated fields in the form should become lists in Python); <strong>marshalling</strong> the values into the types that we want (e.g. an "age" field should become an integer); and <strong>validating</strong> the values (e.g. "age must not be blank").</p>

<p>The bit I end up fighting is making and displaying the forms themselves.  Many frameworks (e.g. <a href="http://code.google.com/p/formalchemy/" rel="nofollow">FormAlchemy</a>) tightly couple their schemas, validation and models to some kind of form widget generation scheme, which I don't like.</p>

<p>The tasks involved in making a form are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Making dynamic widgets (e.g. a select list with values from a database)</li>
<li>Looping over repeating fieldsets (e.g. a list of name, age pairs that each represent a person)</li>
<li>Embedding existing values in the form fields (from a data structure)</li>
<li>Displaying validation errors next to form fields or at the top of the page</li>
</ul>

<p>The options I see for doing this are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>generate</strong>, based on widgets that are defined in the schema (e.g. <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/forms/" rel="nofollow">Django</a>)</li>
<li><strong>post-process</strong> forms, by applying a data structure containing errors and values to an HTML template (e.g. <a href="http://formencode.org/htmlfill.html" rel="nofollow">htmlfill</a>)</li>
<li>accept that for all but the simplest cases, you may as well start from the beginning by encoding the logic (loops, error display, etc) <strong>manually</strong> in each of your form templates</li>
</ul>

<p>Are there any other patterns for handling the problem?  What are the pros and cons of each?  </p>

<p><em>The frameworks (Python) I've looked at / had pointed out so far are: <a href="http://discorporate.us/projects/flatland/docs/tip/" rel="nofollow">flatland</a>, <a href="http://formencode.org/" rel="nofollow">formencode</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/formalchemy/" rel="nofollow">FormAlchemy</a>, <a href="http://ish.io/projects/show/formish" rel="nofollow">formish</a>, <a href="http://wtforms.simplecodes.com/" rel="nofollow">WTForms</a>, <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/forms/" rel="nofollow">Django</a> forms, <a href="http://www.web2py.com/" rel="nofollow">web2py</a>, <a href="http://docs.repoze.org/deform/" rel="nofollow">deform</a>, <a href="http://jimmyg.org/work/code/formconvert/" rel="nofollow">FormConvert</a> and <a href="http://webpy.org/cookbook/forms" rel="nofollow">web.py</a></em></p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I've not really got very far with answering the question about best practise for building forms, but I've made the decision with my current project to go for deform / colander, which is a sane way of handling serialisation etc, but more importantly is well-documented and well-tested.  I am going to avoid form generation at all for all but the simplest forms.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You can try <code>django</code>. It has <code>forms</code> module, that provides many useful mechanisms for web forms.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>There's also <a href="http://webpy.org/" rel="nofollow">web.py</a>'s Form class which you may find interesting. There are examples in its <a href="http://webpy.org/cookbook/" rel="nofollow">cookbook</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You might check out <a href="http://www.web2py.com" rel="nofollow">web2py</a>, which provides several mechanisms for <a href="http://web2py.com/book/default/chapter/07" rel="nofollow">generating and processing forms</a> (see also form-related <a href="http://web2py.com/book/default/chapter/10" rel="nofollow">Javascript and Ajax functionality</a>). Its form objects (and other HTML helper objects) are server-side representations of the HTML DOM and can be manipulated prior to serialization into HTML (see <a href="http://www.web2py.com/AlterEgo/default/show/217" rel="nofollow">ref1</a>, <a href="http://www.web2pyslices.com/main/slices/take_slice/43" rel="nofollow">ref2</a>, <a href="http://web2py.com/book/default/chapter/05#HTML-Helpers" rel="nofollow">ref3</a>, <a href="http://web2py.com/book/default/chapter/05#Server-side-DOM-and-Parsing" rel="nofollow">ref4</a>).

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>A panel featuring several form library authors was presented at PyCon 2010, which might be relevant to your question:</p>

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>have you seen Bruno's <a href="https://github.com/brutasse/django-floppyforms" rel="nofollow">django-floppyforms</a>? It doesn't answer your question but it's worth being aware of it being done. </p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I have recently used <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/flatland" rel="nofollow">flatland</a> to handle a complex form and found it to be very flexible. There's no widgets library, but it has a powerful HTML generator/filter, and as <a href="http://dag-flatland.readthedocs.org/en/latest/patterns/widgets/" rel="nofollow">pointed out</a> in the documentation, it's quite simple to write your own widgets. Don't let the "0.0.2" version fool you, the library is quite mature and stable.</p>
