<h3>Question (ID-4963784):</h3><h2>compute mean in python for a generator</h2><p>I'm doing some statistics work, I have a (large) collection of random numbers to compute the mean of, I'd like to work with generators, because I just need to compute the mean, so I don't need to store the numbers. </p>

<p>The problem is that numpy.mean breaks if you pass it a generator. I can write a simple function to do what I want, but I'm wondering if there's a proper, built-in way to do this?</p>

<p>It would be nice if I could say "sum(values)/len(values)", but len doesn't work for genetators, and sum already consumed values.</p>

<p>here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>import numpy 

def my_mean(values):
    n = 0
    Sum = 0.0
    try:
        while True:
            Sum += next(values)
            n += 1
    except StopIteration: pass
    return float(Sum)/n

X = [k for k in range(1,7)]
Y = (k for k in range(1,7))

print numpy.mean(X)
print my_mean(Y)
</code></pre>

<p>these both give the same, correct, answer, buy my_mean doesn't work for lists, and numpy.mean doesn't work for generators.</p>

<p>I really like the idea of working with generators, but details like this seem to spoil things.</p>

<p>thanks for any help</p>

<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Your approach is a good one, but you should instead use the <code>for x in y</code> idiom instead of repeatedly calling <code>next</code> until you get a <code>StopIteration</code>.  This works for both lists and generators:</p>

<pre><code>def my_mean(values):
    n = 0
    Sum = 0.0

    for value in values:
        Sum += value
        n += 1
    return float(Sum)/n
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Just one simple change to your code would let you use both. Generators were meant to be used interchangeably to lists in a for-loop.</p>

<pre><code>def my_mean(values):
    n = 0
    Sum = 0.0
    for v in values:
        Sum += v
        n += 1
    return Sum / n
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>One way would be</p>

<pre><code>numpy.fromiter(Y, int).mean()
</code></pre>

<p>but this actually temporarily stores the numbers.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><pre><code>def my_mean(values):
    n = 0
    sum = 0
    for v in values:
        sum += v
        n += 1
    return sum/n
</code></pre>

<p>The above is very similar to your code, except by using <code>for</code> to iterate <code>values</code> you are good no matter if you get a list or an iterator.
The python <code>sum</code> method is however very optimized, so unless the list is really, really long, you might be more happy temporarily storing the data.</p>

<p>(Also notice that since you are using python3, you don't need <code>float(sum)/n</code>)</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>The old-fashioned way to do it:</p>

<pre><code>def my_main(values):
   sum, n = 0, 0
   for x in values:
      sum += x
      n += 1
   return float(sum)/n
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Try:</p>

<pre><code>import itertools

def mean(i):
    (i1, i2) = itertools.tee(i, 2)
    return sum(i1) / sum(1 for _ in i2)

print mean([1,2,3,4,5])
</code></pre>

<p><code>tee</code> will duplicate your iterator for any iterable <code>i</code> (e.g. a generator, a list, etc.), allowing you to use one duplicate for summing and the other for counting.</p>

<p>(Note that 'tee' will still use intermediate storage).</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><pre><code>def my_mean(values):
    total = 0
    for n, v in enumerate(values, 1):
        total += v
    return total / n

print my_mean(X)
print my_mean(Y)
</code></pre>
