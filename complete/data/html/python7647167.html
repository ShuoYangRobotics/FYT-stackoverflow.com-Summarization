<h3>Question (ID-7647167):</h3><h2>check if a process is running in python</h2><p>I am trying to find if the process is running based on process id. The code is as follows based on one of the post on the forum. I cannot consider process name as there are more than one process running with the same name. </p>

<pre><code>def findProcess( processId ):
    ps= subprocess.Popen("ps -ef | grep "+processId, shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
    output = ps.stdout.read()
    ps.stdout.close()
    ps.wait()
    return output
def isProcessRunning( processId):
    output = findProcess( processId )
    if re.search(processId, output) is None:
        return true
    else:
        return False
</code></pre>

<p>Output :</p>

<pre><code>1111 72312 72311   0   0:00.00 ttys000    0:00.00 /bin/sh -c ps -ef | grep 71676
1111 72314 72312   0   0:00.00 ttys000    0:00.00 grep 71676
</code></pre>

<p>It always return true as it can find the process id in the output string. </p>

<p>Any suggestions? Thanks for any help.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Try:</p>

<pre><code>os.kill(pid, 0)
</code></pre>

<p>Should succeed (and do nothing) if the process exists, or throw an exception (that you can catch) if the process doesn't exist.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>If that process belongs to the same user the checking process, you can just try to <code>kill</code> it. If you use signal 0, kill will not send anything but still allow you to tell if the process is available.</p>

<p>From <code>kill(2)</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If sig is 0, then no signal is sent, but error checking is still
  performed; this can be used to check for the existence of a process ID
  or process group ID.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This should propagate appropriately to python's methods.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If you don't mind using external module I'd suggest <a href="http://code.google.com/p/psutil/" rel="nofollow">psutil</a>. It is cross-platform and easier to use than spawning subshell only for purpose of finding a running process.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>This is a bit of a kludge, but on *nix you can use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/os.html#os.getpgid" rel="nofollow">os.getpgid(pid)</a> or <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/os.html#os.kill" rel="nofollow">os.kill(pid, sig)</a> to test the existence of the process ID.</p>

<pre><code>import os

def is_process_running(process_id):
    try:
        os.kill(process_id, 0)
        return True
    except OSError:
        return False
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: Note that <code>os.kill</code> works on Windows (as of Python 2.7), while <code>os.getpgid</code> <em>won't</em>.  <strong>But</strong> the Windows version calls <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms686714%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">TerminateProcess()</a>, which will "unconditionally cause a process to exit", so I predict that it won't safely return the information you want without actually killing the process if it does exist.</p>

<p>If you're using Windows, please let us know, because none of these solutions are acceptable in that scenario.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>The simplest answer in my opinion (albiet maybe not ideal), would be to change your</p>

<pre><code>ps -ef | grep &lt;pid&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>To:</p>

<pre><code>ps -ef | grep &lt;pid&gt; | grep -v grep
</code></pre>

<p>This will ignore the process listing for the grep search containing the PID of the process you are trying to find. </p>

<p>It seems user9876's answer is far more "pythonic" however. </p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You have to find it twice..</p>

<p>Like this :</p>

<p><code>ps -ef | grep 71676 | sed 's/71676//' | grep 71676</code></p>

<p>If this returns <code>True</code> then this is actually running !!</p>
