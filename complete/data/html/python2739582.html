<h3>Question (ID-2739582):</h3><h2>Condition checking vs. Exception handling</h2><p>When is exception handling more preferable than condition checking? There are many situations where I can choose using one or the other.</p>

<p>For example, this is a summing function which uses a custom exception:</p>

<pre><code># module mylibrary 
class WrongSummand(Exception):
    pass

def sum_(a, b):
    """ returns the sum of two summands of the same type """
    if type(a) != type(b):
        raise WrongSummand("given arguments are not of the same type")
    return a + b


# module application using mylibrary
from mylibrary import sum_, WrongSummand

try:
    print sum_("A", 5)
except WrongSummand:
    print "wrong arguments"
</code></pre>

<p>And this is the same function, which avoids using exceptions</p>

<pre><code># module mylibrary
def sum_(a, b):
    """ returns the sum of two summands if they are both of the same type """
    if type(a) == type(b):
        return a + b


# module application using mylibrary
from mylibrary import sum_

c = sum_("A", 5)
if c is not None:
    print c
else:
    print "wrong arguments"
</code></pre>

<p>I think that using conditions is always more readable and manageable. Or am I wrong? What are the proper cases for defining APIs which raise exceptions and why?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Generally, you want to use condition checking for situations which are understandable, expected, and able to be handled. You would use exceptions for cases that are incoherent or unhandleable. </p>

<p>So, if you think of your "add" function. It should NEVER return null. That is not a coherent result for adding two things. In that case, there is an error in the arguments that were passed in and the function should <em>not</em> attempt to pretend that everything is okay. This is a perfect case to throw an exception. </p>

<p>You would want to use condition checking and return null if you are in a regular or normal execution case. For instance, <code>IsEqual</code> could be a good case to use conditions, and return false if one of your conditions fails. I.E.</p>

<pre><code>fuction bool IsEqual(obj a, obj b)
{ 
   if(a is null) return false;
   if(b is null) return false;
   if(a.Type != b.Type) return false;

   bool result = false;
   //Do custom IsEqual comparison code
   return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>In that scenario, you are returning false both for the exception cases AND the "objects are not equal case". This means that the consumer (calling party) cannot tell whether the comparison failed or the objects were simply <em>not equal</em>. If those cases need to be distinguished, then you should use exceptions instead of conditions.</p>

<p>Ultimately, you want to ask yourself whether the consumer will be able to specifically handle the failure case that you encountered. If your method/function <em>cannot do what it needs to do</em> then you probably want to throw an exception. </p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Exceptions are much more manageable, because they define general families of things that can go wrong. 
In your example there is only one possible problem, so there is no advantage to using exceptions. But if you had another class that does division, then it needs to signal that you can't devide by zero. Simply returning <code>None</code> wouldn't work anymore.</p>

<p>On the other hand, exceptions can be subclassed and you can catch specific exceptions, depending on how much you care about the underlying problem. For example, you could have a <code>DoesntCompute</code> base exception and subclasses like <code>InvalidType</code> and <code>InvalidArgument</code>. If you just want a result, you can wrap all computations in a block that catches <code>DoesntCompute</code>, but you can still do very specific error handling just as easy.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If you're asking, you should probably be using exceptions. Exceptions are used to indicate exceptional circumstances, a specific case where things work differently from other cases. This is the case for prettymuch all errors and for many other things as well. </p>

<p>In your second implementation of <code>sum_</code>, the user <em>has to check</em> every single time what the value was. This is reminiscent of the C/Fortran/other-languages boilerplate (and frequent source of errors) where error codes go unchecked that we avoid. You have to write code like this at all levels to be able to propagate errors. It gets messy and is especially avoided in Python.</p>

<p>A couple other notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>You often don't need to make your own exceptions. For many cases, the builtin exceptions like <code>ValueError</code> and <code>TypeError</code> are appropriate. </li>
<li>When I do create a new exception, which is pretty useful, I often try to subclass something more specific than <code>Exception</code>. The built-in exception hierarchy is <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/exceptions.html#exception-hierarchy" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</li>
<li><p>I would never implement a function like <code>sum_</code>, since typechecking makes your code less flexible, maintainable, and idiomatic. </p>

<p>I would simply write the function</p>

<pre><code>def sum_(a, b):
    return a + b
</code></pre>

<p>which would work if the objects were compatible and if not it would <em>already</em> throw an exception, the <code>TypeError</code> that everyone is used to seeing. Consider how my implementation works</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; sum_(1, 4)
5
&gt;&gt;&gt; sum_(4.5, 5.0)
9.5
&gt;&gt;&gt; sum_([1, 2], [3, 4])
[1, 2, 3, 4]
&gt;&gt;&gt; sum_(3.5, 5) # This operation makes perfect sense, but would fail for you
8.5
&gt;&gt;&gt; sum_("cat", 7) # This makes no sense and already is an error.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in sum_
TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'int' objects
</code></pre>

<p>My code was shorter and simpler yet is more robust and flexible than yours. This is why we avoid typechecking in Python.</p></li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You should throw exception when the parameter contains an unexpected value. </p>

<p>With your examples, I would recommend to throw exception when the two parameters are of different types. </p>

<p>To throw an exception is an elegant way to abort a service without cluttering up your code.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>My main reason for preferring exceptions to status returns has to do with considering what happens if the programmer forgets to do his job.  With exceptions, you might overlook catching an exception.  In that case, your system will visibly fail, and you'll have a chance to consider where to add a catch.  With status returns, if you forget to check the return, it will be silently ignore, and your code will continue on, possibly failing later in a mysterious way.  I prefer the visible failure to the invisible one.</p>

<p>There are other reasons, which I've explained here: <a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/text/exceptions-vs-status.html" rel="nofollow">Exceptions vs. Status Returns</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Maybe <code>sum_</code> looks fine alone. What if, you know, it actually is used?</p>

<pre><code>#foo.py
def sum_(a, b):
    if type(a) == type(b):
        return a + b
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<pre><code>#egg.py
from foo import sum_:
def egg(c = 5):
  return sum_(3, c)
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<pre><code>#bar.py
from egg import egg
def bar():
  return len(egg("2"))
if __name__ == "__main__":
  print bar()
</code></pre>

<p>If you ran <code>bar.py</code> you would get:</p>

<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "bar.py", line 6, in &lt;module&gt;
    print bar()
  File "bar.py", line 4, in bar
    return len(egg("2"))
TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()
</code></pre>

<p>See -- usually one calls a function with the intent to act on its output. If you simply "swallow" the exception and return a dummy value, who uses your code will have an hard time troubleshooting. First off, the traceback is completely useless. This alone should be enough reason.</p>

<p>Who wants to fix this bug would have to first doublecheck <code>bar.py</code>, then analize <code>egg.py</code> trying to figure out where exactly the None came from. After reading <code>egg.py</code> they'll have to read <code>sum_.py</code> and hopefully notice the implicit return of <code>None</code>; only then they understand the problem: they failed the type check because of the parameter <code>egg.py</code> put in for them.</p>

<p>Put a bit of actual complexity in this and thing get ugly really fast.</p>

<p>Python, unlike C, is written with the <a href="http://docs.python.org/glossary.html#term-eafp" rel="nofollow">Easier to Ask Forgiveness than Permission</a> principle in mind: <em>if something goes wrong, I'll get an exception</em>. If you pass me a <code>None</code> where I expect an actual value, things will break, the exception will happen far away from the line actually causing it and people <em>will</em> curse in your general direction in twenty different languages, then change the code to throw a suitable exception (<code>TypeError("incompatible operand type")</code>).</p>
