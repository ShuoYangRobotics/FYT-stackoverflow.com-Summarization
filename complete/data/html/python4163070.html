<h3>Question (ID-4163070):</h3><h2>Python vs PHP speed</h2><p>I want to solve a problem from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Euler" rel="nofollow">Project Euler</a> (BTW, problem 25), and I found a solution in Python:</p>

<pre><code>fibonacci = 1
old1 = 0
old2 = 1
limit = 1000

i = 1

while len(str(fibonacci)) &lt; limit:
    fibonacci = old1 + old2
    old1 = old2
    old2 = fibonacci
    i = i + 1

print(i)
</code></pre>

<p>It took 1.5 seconds to calculate.</p>

<p>I implemented the same in PHP, this is the code:</p>

<pre><code>$fibonacci = 1;
$old1 = 0;
$old2 = 1;
$limit = 1000;

$i = 1;

while (strlen((string)$fibonacci) &lt; $limit){
    $fibonacci = $old1 + $old2;
    $old1 = $old2;
    $old2 = $fibonacci;
    $i = $i + 1;
}
print($i);
</code></pre>

<p>And it took more than 30 minutes, and still calculating...</p>

<p>I know that Python is considered faster than PHP, but still it shouldn't be so big a difference. How to improve my PHP code to get the results faster, if there is a way to do it? </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>I edit this post based on comments below so first my solution was not going to work.
One solution can be instead of old while to put this one:</p>

<pre><code>while (strlen(number_format($fibonacci, 0, '', '')) &lt; $limit){ ... }
</code></pre>

<p>But again is a big speed issue.</p>

<p>So the final solution is using <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.bc.php" rel="nofollow">BCMath</a>:</p>

<pre><code>$fibonacci = '1';
$old1 = '0';
$old2 = '1';
$limit = 1000;

$i = 1;

while (strlen($fibonacci) &lt; $limit){

    $fibonacci = bcadd($old1, $old2);
    $old1 = $old2;
    $old2 = $fibonacci;
    $i = $i + 1;
}
echo $fibonacci . "&lt;br /&gt;";
print($i);
</code></pre>

<p>So you can get the results at the same speed as Python in PHP.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Definitely, the PHP is going into an infinite loop. There's no way it could be taking that long if there wasn't something wrong...</p>

<p>I don't think counting the digits of these numbers with <code>strlen</code> is going to work in PHP. PHP is dealing with the numbers in scientific notation, in lower precision than Python.</p>

<p>I added debugging <code>echo</code> statements to PHP, to print out $fibonacci and $i for each step.</p>

<p>A typical Python line looks like </p>

<pre><code>fib is 7540113804746346429
i is 92
</code></pre>

<p>In PHP, that's</p>

<pre><code>fib is 7.54011380475E+18
i is 92
</code></pre>

<p>To accomplish this in PHP, you'll probably need to use a higher precision math library.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.bc.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.bc.php</a> - you can use the <code>bcadd</code> function to accomplish the addition, and it will work as it does in Python.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>It isn't a speed issue, it's a logic problem in the while condition for termination.</p>

<p>It's probably not going to finish. When you convert the current value of $fibonacci to a string in your while test, it will be converted to scientific format and truncated to a limited set of decimal places (dependent on your precision setting) when you cast it to string. That number of digits will be a lot less than 1000, so the while termination condition won't ever be met.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Since the problem seems to be with converting to strings, here's a much faster way to do it that doesn't require it. This is essentially the same algorithm as you have posted (so I don't feel bad showing it to you) but demonstrates how to use division to test the length of an integer instead of converting it to a string.</p>

<pre><code>def fibonacci_digits(limit):
    limit = 10**limit
    fib = 1
    old1 = 0
    old2 = 1

    i = 1
    size = 1
    while size &lt; limit:
        fib = old1 + old2
        if not size//fib:  # // is pythons integer division operator, not a comment
            size *= 10
        old1 = old2
        old2 = fib
        i += 1

    return i

print fibonacci_digits(1000)
</code></pre>

<p>Converting to a string is slow and is almost never the right thing to do. Here's the timeit results:</p>

<pre><code>$ python -mtimeit -s'import fib' 'fib.fibonacci_digits(1000)'
10 loops, best of 3: 30.2 msec per loop

$ python -mtimeit -s'import fib' 'fib.fibonacci_digits2(1000)'
10 loops, best of 3: 1.41 sec per loop
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The problem is, that you are working with big numbers. You should use BC Math Functions (<a href="http://php.net/bc" rel="nofollow">php.net/bc</a>). So your code can be:</p>

<pre><code>$fibonacci = "1";
$old1 = "0";
$old2 = "1";
$limit = 1000;

$i = 1;

while (strlen($fibonacci) &lt; $limit){
    $fibonacci = bcadd($old1, $old2);
    $old1 = $old2;
    $old2 = $fibonacci;
    $i = $i + 1;
}
print($i);
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried it and it takes about 0.095s.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Many of project Euler problems will have to handle big numbers.
PHP will make your big numbers look like <code>2.579234678963E+12</code> which is the Exponential representation of the number... It's obviously hard to work with. 
So, for most of problems, it's best to go with <a href="http://php.net/bc" rel="nofollow">BCMath Functions</a>. This will keep your number as it is, even if it is a giant number.</p>

<p>Note that using <code>echo bcmul(500,500);</code> will never be as fast as <code>echo 500*500</code>. And, BCMath function return values are always strings.</p>

<p>To fix your problem replace all arithmetic operations with the corresponding BCMath function. </p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I optimized a bit the Python code. Using len(str()) to check the number of digits is very slow. Replaced by math.log10 run your program much faster</p>

<p><em><strong>The first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000 digits is : 4782
Calculated in 0.008573 seconds</em></strong></p>

<pre><code>import time
from math import log10


def digits(n): # Return the number of digits for n&gt;=1
    return int(log10(n))+1

fibonacci = 1L # Thanks to Python to handle very big numbers
old1 = 0
old2 = 1
limit = 1000

i = 1


start = time.time() #Start timer for bench
while digits(fibonacci) &lt; limit:
    fibonacci = old1 + old2
    old1 = old2
    old2 = fibonacci
    i +=  1



print "The first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain %s digits is : %s" % (str(limit), str(i))

print "Calculated in %3.6f seconds" %  (time.time() - start)
