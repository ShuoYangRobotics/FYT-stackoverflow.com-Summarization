<h3>Question (ID-1336489):</h3><h2>job queue implementation for python</h2><p>Do you know/use any distributed job queue for python? Can you share links or tools</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-9):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Pyres is a resque clone built in python. Resque is used by Github as their message queue. Both use Redis as the queue backend and provide a web-based monitoring application.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>In addition to multiprocessing there's also the <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/celery/0.6.0" rel="nofollow">Celery</a> project, if you're using Django.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>There's also "bucker" by Sylvain Hellegouarch which you can find here:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://trac.defuze.org/wiki/bucker" rel="nofollow">http://trac.defuze.org/wiki/bucker</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It describes itself like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>bucker is a queue system that supports multiple storage for the queue (memcached, Amazon SQS for now) and is driven by XML messages sent over a TCP connections between a client and the queue server.</li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>there are a couple of python rabbitmq clients - see <a href="http://playgroundblues.com/posts/2009/may/20/working-django-and-rabbitmq/" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> for instance.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>redqueue?
It's implemented in python+tornado framework, speaks memcached protocol and is optionally persistent into log files.
Currently it is also able to behave like beanstalkd, the reserve/delete way in memcache protocol as well.</p>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>It's a year late or whatever, but this is something I've hacked together to make a queue of Processes executing them only X number at a time. <a href="http://github.com/goosemo/job_queue" rel="nofollow">http://github.com/goosemo/job_queue</a></p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>You probably want to look at multiprocessing's Queue. Included in Python 2.6, get it on PyPI for earlier versions of Python.</p>

<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Look at <a href="http://xph.us/software/beanstalkd/" rel="nofollow">beanstalkd</a></p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>Also there is Unix 'at'</p>
