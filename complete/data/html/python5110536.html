<h3>Question (ID-5110536):</h3><h2>Match 0 to 100 or 0% to 100% using regex</h2><p>I'm trying to match the following, and i'm having a difficult time doing so.</p>

<p>I want to allow 0 to 100, or 0% to 100%. In my textfield, i strip the % out, so if they put in 100, it won't fail at the regex and skip the strip.</p>

<p>Therefore, i'd need a regex to allow 0 to 100 or 0% to 100%. 101 or 101% is invalid.</p>

<p>Presently, i have the following</p>

<pre><code>(?:^((\\%)?100(\\%)?$)|(?:^(\\%)?[0-9]{1,2}(\\%)?)((\\.|,)?[0-9]+)?$)
</code></pre>

<p>But that allows 101 but not 101%</p>

<p>Please help! Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You're trying to use regex to do something that regex isn't meant to do. You have the javascript and python tags; you should use regex to ensure that the input is a number, and then use javascript or python to determine whether the number is too big or too small. It will be much easier that way.</p>

<p><strong>In all seriousness</strong>, you are trying to do something that Regular Expressions aren't intended to do, which is perform logic. What you are asking is, does this string of characters contain a number, which is fine and if it does, is it <code>&gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; &lt;= 100</code> which <strong>isn't</strong> something a regular expression can do.</p>

<p>While the expression <a href="http://rubular.com/r/pMgMUUvfNp" rel="nofollow">^(\d{1,2}|100)%?$</a> will work to tell you if the input matches the pattern, and let you pull the number out using the group. The fact that the result falls into the <code>&gt;=0 &amp;&amp; &lt;= 100</code> range is a <strong>side effect</strong>. This apparent range checking behavior won't work for any other arbitrary range of numbers. Side effects should be avoided for maintainable code.</p>

<p><strong>Is it the optimal solution?</strong> Is the intention <strong>obvious</strong> from just looking at the expression? I would argue <strong>no</strong>, not without some comments describing the intent.</p>

<p><strong>JavaScript</strong></p>

<p>I think a better more maintainable solution would be to use the <code>parseInt()</code> function and then explicitly compare the result to <code>&gt;= 0</code> and <code>&lt;= 100</code>. <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/" rel="nofollow">Explicit is Better than Implicit</a> and is more self documenting.</p>

<p><strong>Python</strong></p>

<p>You will still have to resort to a regular expression to validate the format and extract only the numbers and convert that using <code>int()</code>, testing against the valid range would be redundant but also more <strong>explicit</strong>. Using the regular expression might not be such a bad option in this case, as long as you comment the intention of the use of the regular expression.</p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><code>/^(100|[0-9]{1,2})%?$/</code></p>

<ul>
<li>either '100' or any number consisting of one or two digits</li>
<li>possibly followed by a percent sign.</li>
</ul>

<p>Test it here: <a href="http://jsbin.com/azeya3" rel="nofollow">http://jsbin.com/azeya3</a>.</p>

<p>Oh yes, and the first capture contains the number.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>use on javascript "parseInt"</p>

<p>parseInt does following:</p>

<pre><code>"100" -&gt; 100
"10k" -&gt; 10
"100%" -&gt; 100
</code></pre>

<p>after this, check if your number is smaller than 101.</p>

<p>example...</p>

<pre><code>function parsePerc(value) {
   return parseInt(value) &lt; 101;
}
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>In the spirit of @eykanal's answer, here's a regex:</p>

<p><code>(\d{1,3})%?</code> works for me in Python with <a href="http://www.nmichaels.org/regular.py" rel="nofollow">this</a>.</p>

<p>My test text was:</p>

<pre><code>101
100
100%
101%
0%
0
50%
</code></pre>

<p>That will get you just the number, which you can then parse and decide whether or not it's in your acceptable range.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>The question is tagged "python", so I'll answer in Python:</p>

<pre><code>def is0to100(num):
    try:
        return 0 &lt;= int(num.rstrip('%')) &lt;= 100
    except ValueError:
        return False
</code></pre>

<p>This returns True if the passed-in value, minus the possible trailing '%', is a valid integer between 0 and 100. I didn't benchmark it, but I'd put money that it's way faster than a regexp.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>First, I agreed with eykanal and Jarrod Roberson</p>

<p>But then, it's so simple with a regex that I doesn't agree more and that it's the better solution according to me:</p>

<pre><code>'(\d\d?|100)(?!\d)\Z'  and use of match()
</code></pre>

<p>I think that presenting in first position <code>\d\d?</code> for detecting numbers &lt; 100 , and in second position the number <code>100</code> alone,  is of more natural logic.</p>

<p>Also <code>\d\d?</code> is shorter and more rapidly understood than <code>\d{1,2}</code></p>

<p>EDIT</p>

<p>better :</p>

<pre><code>'(\d\d?|100)\D?\Z'
</code></pre>

<p>But these RE are for detection. Since the aim is to verify, this one is enough:</p>

<pre><code>'(\d\d?|100)\Z'
</code></pre>
