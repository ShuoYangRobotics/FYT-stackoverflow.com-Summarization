<h3>Question (ID-2523689):</h3><h2>Easiest ways to generate graphs from Python?</h2><p>I'm using Python to process CSV files filled with data that I want to run calculations on, and then graph.  I'm looking for a library to use that I can send processed CSV information to, or a dict of some sort, and then choose different graphing styles with.  </p>

<p>Does anyone have any recommendations?</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">Matplotlib</a> and <a href="http://gnuplot-py.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">Gnuplot.py</a> are popular choices. I've used both.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I've been using <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow" title="matplotlib">matplotlib</a> for about 3 years now to plot experimental data.  Before I was using Excel and that was just a pain.  I've been happy with matplotlib ever since.  It's great and very powerful.</p>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>It depends on the kind of graph you want,
most of the time, i'm using matplotlib but sometimes<a href="http://dkbza.org/pydot/pydot.html" rel="nofollow">pydot</a> is good.
The various layout algorithms are good for me when dealing with huge graphs</p>
