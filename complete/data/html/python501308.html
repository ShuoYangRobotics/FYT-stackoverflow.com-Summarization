<h3>Question (ID-501308):</h3><h2>Problem in understanding Python list comprehensions</h2><p>What does the last line mean in the following code?</p>

<pre><code>import pickle, urllib                                                                                                                                                     

  handle = urllib.urlopen("http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pc/def/banner.p")
  data = pickle.load(handle)
  handle.close()

  for elt in data:
         print "".join([e[1] * e[0] for e in elt])
</code></pre>

<p>My attempt to the problem:</p>

<ul>
<li>"".join... uses join -method to empty text</li>
<li>e[1] * e[0] multiplies two subsequent values in the sequence, e</li>
<li>I am not sure what is e</li>
<li>I am not sure, what it means, when you have something before for -loop, like: <code>e[1] * e[0] for e in elt</code></li>
</ul>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Maybe best explained with an example:</p>

<pre><code>print "".join([e[1] * e[0] for e in elt])
</code></pre>

<p>is the short form of</p>

<pre><code>x = []
for e in elt:
  x.append(e[1] * e[0])
print "".join(x)
</code></pre>

<p>List comprehensions are simply syntactic sugar for <code>for</code> loops, which make an expression out of a sequence of statements.</p>

<p><code>elt</code> can be an arbitrary object, since you load it from pickles, and <code>e</code> likewise. The usage suggests that is it a <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-str-unicode-list-tuple-buffer-xrange" rel="nofollow">sequence</a> type, but it could just be anything that implements the sequence protocol.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Firstly, you need to put http:// in front of the URL, ie:
handle = urllib.urlopen("http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pc/def/banner.p")</p>

<p>An expression [e for e in aList] is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_comprehension" rel="nofollow">list comprehension</a> which generates a list of values.</p>

<p>With Python strings, the * operator is used to repeat a string. Try typing in the commands one by one into an interpreter then look at data:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; data[0]
[(' ', 95)]
</code></pre>

<p>This shows us each line of data is a tuple containing two elements.</p>

<p>Thus the expression e[1] * e[0] is effectively the string in e[0] repeated e[1] times.</p>

<p>Hence the program draws a banner.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><code>[e[1] * e[0] for e in elt]</code> is a list comprehension, which evaluates to a list itself by looping through another list, in this case <code>elt</code>.  Each element in the new list is <code>e[1]*e[0]</code>, where <code>e</code> is the corresponding element in <code>elt</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>join() is a string method, that works on a separator in new string</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; ':'.join(['ab', 'cd'])
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'ab:cd'
</code></pre>

<p>and list comprehension is not necessary there, generator would suffice</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Andy's is a great answer!</p>

<p>If you want to see every step of the loop (with line-breaks) try this out:</p>

<pre><code>for elt in data:
    for e in elt:
        print "e[0] == %s, e[1] == %d, which gives us:  '%s'" % (e[0], e[1], ''.join(e[1] * e[0]))
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>The question itself has already been fully answered but I'd like to add that a list comprehension also supports filtering.  Your original line</p>

<pre><code>print "".join([e[1] * e[0] for e in elt])
</code></pre>

<p>could,  as an example,  become</p>

<pre><code>print "".join([e[1] * e[0] for e in elt if len(e) == 2])
</code></pre>

<p>to only operate on items in elt that have two elements.</p>
