<h3>Question (ID-606350):</h3><h2>How can I debug a regular expression in python?</h2><p>Is there a way to debug a regular expression in Python? And I'm not referring to the process of trying and trying till they work :)</p>

<p>EDIT: here is how regexes can be debugged in perl :</p>

<pre><code>
use re 'debug';

my $str = "GET http://some-site.com HTTP/1.1";
if($str =~/get\s+(\S+)/i) {
    print "MATCH:$1\n";
}
</code></pre>

<p>The code above produces the following output on my computer when ran :</p>

<pre><code>
Compiling REx "get\s+(\S+)"
Final program:
   1: EXACTF  (3)
   3: PLUS (5)
   4:   SPACE (0)
   5: OPEN1 (7)
   7:   PLUS (9)
   8:     NSPACE (0)
   9: CLOSE1 (11)
  11: END (0)
stclass EXACTF  minlen 5
Matching REx "get\s+(\S+)" against "GET http://some-site.com HTTP/1.1"
Matching stclass EXACTF  against "GET http://some-site.com HTTP/1.1" (33 chars)
   0           |  1:EXACTF (3)
   3        |  3:PLUS(5)
                                  SPACE can match 1 times out of 2147483647...
   4       |  5:  OPEN1(7)
   4       |  7:  PLUS(9)
                                    NSPACE can match 20 times out of 2147483647...
  24       |  9:    CLOSE1(11)
  24       | 11:    END(0)
Match successful!
MATCH:http://some-site.com
Freeing REx: "get\s+(\S+)"

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Why don't you use some regEx tool (i usually use <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/regulator/" rel="nofollow">Regulator</a>) and test the regex-expression there and when you are satisfied, just copy/paste it into your code.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Similar to the already mentioned, there is also <a href="http://www.regexbuddy.com/benefits.html" rel="nofollow">Regexbuddy</a></p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Not sure about doing such a thing directly in Python, but I could definitely suggest using a RegEx editor tool. That's likely to be your best bet anyway. Personally, I've used <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/regulator/" rel="nofollow">The Regulator</a> and found it to very helpful. Some others are listed in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32282/regex-testing-tools#32365">this SO thread</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I quite often use <a href="http://regexpal.com/" rel="nofollow">RegexPal</a> for quick checks (an online regular expression prototyper). It has a lot of the common expressions listed along with a simple expression. Very handy when you don't have a dedicated tool and just need a quick way to work out a somple regex.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>What RegexBuddy has that the other tools don't have is a built-in <a href="http://www.regexbuddy.com/debug.html" rel="nofollow">debugger</a> that shows you the entire matching process of both successful and failed match attempts. The other tools only show the final result (which RegexBuddy can show too).</p>
