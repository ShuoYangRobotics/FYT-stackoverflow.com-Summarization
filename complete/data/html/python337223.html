<h3>Question (ID-337223):</h3><h2>Python: item for item until stopterm in item?</h2><p>Disclaimer: I'm fairly new to python!</p>

<p>If I want all the lines of a file until (edit: and including) the line containing some string <code>stopterm</code>, is there a way of using the list syntax for it? I was hoping there would be something like:</p>

<pre><code>usefullines = [line for line in file until stopterm in line]
</code></pre>

<p>For now, I've got</p>

<pre><code>usefullines = []
for line in file:
    usefullines.append(line)
    if stopterm in line:
        break
</code></pre>

<p>It's not the end of the world, but since there rest of Python syntax is so straightforward, I was hoping for a 1 thought->1 Python line mapping.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Here's a way that keeps the stopterm line:</p>

<pre><code>def useful_lines(lines, stopterm):
    for line in lines:
        if stopterm in line:
            yield line
            break
        yield line

usefullines = useful_lines(lines, stopterm)
# or...
for line in useful_lines(lines, stopterm):
    # ... do stuff
    pass
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>" I was hoping for a 1 thought->1 Python line mapping."  Wouldn't we all love a programming language that somehow mirrored our natural language?</p>

<p>You can achieve that, you just need to define your unique thoughts once.  Then you have the 1:1 mapping you were hoping for.</p>

<pre><code>def usefulLines( aFile ):
    for line in aFile:
        yield line
        if line == stopterm:
            break
</code></pre>

<p>Is pretty much it.</p>

<pre><code>for line in usefulLines( aFile ):
    # process a line, knowing it occurs BEFORE stopterm.
</code></pre>

<p>There are more general approaches.  The <code>lassevk</code> answers with <code>enum_while</code> and <code>enum_until</code> are generalizations of this simple design pattern.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>That itertools solution is neat. I have earlier been amazed by itertools.groupby, one handy tool.</p>

<p>But still i was just tinkering if I could do this without itertools. So here it is
(There is one assumption and one drawback though: the file is not huge and its goes for one extra complete iteration over the lines, respectively.)</p>

<p>I created a sample file named "try":</p>

<pre><code>hello
world
happy
day
bye
</code></pre>

<p>once you read the file and have the lines in a variable name lines:</p>

<pre><code>lines=open('./try').readlines()
</code></pre>

<p>then </p>

<pre><code>    print [each for each in lines if lines.index(each)&lt;=[lines.index(line) for line in lines if 'happy' in line][0]]
</code></pre>

<p>gives the result:</p>

<pre><code>['hello\n', 'world\n', 'happy\n']
</code></pre>

<p>and </p>

<pre><code>print [each for each in lines if lines.index(each)&lt;=[lines.index(line) for line in lines if 'day' in line][0]]
</code></pre>

<p>gives the result:</p>

<pre><code>['hello\n', 'world\n', 'happy\n', 'day\n']
</code></pre>

<p>So you got the last line - the stop term line also included.</p>

<p>Well, [x for x in enumerable] will run until enumerable doesn't produce data any more, the if-part will simply allow you to filter along the way.</p>

<p>What you can do is add a function, and filter your enumerable through it:</p>

<pre><code>def enum_until(source, until_criteria):
    for k in source:
        if until_criteria(k):
            break;
        yield k;

def enum_while(source, while_criteria):
    for k in source:
        if not while_criteria(k):
            break;
        yield k;

l1 = [k for k in enum_until(xrange(1, 100000), lambda y: y == 100)];
l2 = [k for k in enum_while(xrange(1, 100000), lambda y: y &lt; 100)];
print l1;
print l2;
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, it doesn't look as nice as what you wanted...</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I think it's fine to keep it that way. Sophisticated one-liner are not really pythonic, and since Guido had to put a limit somewhere, I guess this is it...</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I'd go with <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/337223/python-item-for-item-until-stopterm-in-item#337285">Steven Huwig's</a> or <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/337223/python-item-for-item-until-stopterm-in-item#337279">S.Lott's</a> solutions for real usage, but as a slightly hacky solution, here's one way to obtain this behaviour:</p>

<pre><code>def stop(): raise StopIteration()

usefullines = list(stop() if stopterm in line else line for line in file)
</code></pre>

<p>It's slightly abusing the fact that anything that raises StopIteration will abort the current iteration (here the generator expression) and uglier to read than your desired syntax, but will work.</p>
