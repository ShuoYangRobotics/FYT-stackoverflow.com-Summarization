<h3>Question (ID-2161152):</h3><h2>Sweave for python</h2><p>I've recently started using <a href="http://www.stat.uni-muenchen.de/~leisch/Sweave/">Sweave</a>* for creating reports of analyses run with R, and am now looking to do the same with my python scripts. </p>

<p>I've found references to <a href="http://romainfrancois.blog.free.fr/index.php?post/2009/01/21/Python-and-Sweave">embedding python in Sweave</a> docs, but that seems like a bit of a hack. Has anyone worked out a better solution, or is there an equivalent for python I'm not aware of?</p>

<p>* <em>Sweave is a tool that allows to embed the R code for complete data analyses in latex documents</em></p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I don't believe that there's a direct equivalent, so Romain Francois's suggestion (in your link) is probably the best.  You might also want to consider the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Have a look at <a href="http://pylit.berlios.de/" rel="nofollow">PyLit</a> and <a href="http://gael-varoquaux.info/computers/pyreport/" rel="nofollow">PyReport</a> which are intended for literate programming with Python.</li>
<li><a href="http://sphinx.pocoo.org/" rel="nofollow">Sphinx</a> is great for documenting with python, and can output LaTex.</li>
<li>Here's <a href="http://www.literateprogramming.com/tools.html" rel="nofollow">a list of tools for literate programming</a>.  Some of these work with any programming language.</li>
</ol>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I have written a Python implementation of Sweave called Pweave that implements basic functionality and some options of Sweave for Python code embedded in reST or Latex document. You can get it here: <a href="http://mpastell.com/pweave" rel="nofollow">http://mpastell.com/pweave</a> and see the original blog post here:  <a href="http://mpastell.com/2010/03/03/pweave-sweave-for-python/" rel="nofollow">http://mpastell.com/2010/03/03/pweave-sweave-for-python/</a></p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.dexy.it/">Dexy</a> is a very similar product to Sweave. One advantage of Dexy is that it is not exclusive to one single language. You could create a Dexy document that included R code, Python code, or about anything else. </p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You might consider noweb, which is language independent and is the basis for Sweave. I've used it for Python and it works well. </p>

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I've restructured Matti's Pweave a bit, so that it is possible to define arbitrary "chunk-processors" as plugin-modules.  This makes it easy to extend for several chunk-based text-preprocessing applications.  The restructured version is available at <a href="https://bitbucket.org/edgimar/pweave/src" rel="nofollow">https://bitbucket.org/edgimar/pweave/src</a>.  As an example, you could write the following LaTeX-Pweave document (notice the "processor name" in this example is specified with the name 'mplfig'):</p>

<pre><code>\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\begin{document}
\title{Test document}
\maketitle

Don't miss the great information in Figure \ref{myfig}!


&lt;&lt;p=mplfig, label=myfig, caption = "Figure caption..."&gt;&gt;=
import sys
import pylab as pl

pl.plot([1,2,3,4,5],['2,4,6,8,10'], 'b.', markersize=15)
pl.axis('scaled')
pl.axis([-3,3, -3,3]) # [xmin,xmax, ymin,ymax]
@

\end{document}
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You could try <a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/sagetex.html" rel="nofollow">SageTeX</a> which implements Sweave-Like functionality for the <a href="http://www.sagemath.org" rel="nofollow">SAGE</a> mathematics platform. I haven't played around with it as much as I would like to, but SAGE is basically a python shell and evaluates python as it's native language.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I have also thought about the same thing many times. After reading your questions and looking into your link I made small modifications to the custom python Sweave driver, that you link to. I modified it to also keep the source code  and produce the output as well the same way that Sweave does for R.</p>

<p>I posted the modified version and an example here: <a href="http://mpastell.com/2010/02/09/python-in-sweave-document/" rel="nofollow">http://mpastell.com/2010/02/09/python-in-sweave-document/</a></p>

<p>Granted, it is not optimal but I'm quite happy with the output and I like the ability to include both R and Python in the same document. </p>

<p><strong>Edit about PyLit</strong>:</p>

<p>I also like PyLit and contrary to my original answer you can catch ouput with it as well, although it not as elegant as Sweave! Here is a small example how to do it:</p>

<pre><code>import sys

# Catch PyLit output

a = range(3)
sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
print a
sys.stdout = sys.__stdout__

# .. include:: output.txt
</code></pre>
