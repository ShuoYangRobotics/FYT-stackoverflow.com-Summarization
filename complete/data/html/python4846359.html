<h3>Question (ID-4846359):</h3><h2>Hide curly braces in C#</h2><p>After getting back into Python, I'm starting to notice and be annoyed more and more by my C# coding style requiring braces everywhere</p>

<pre><code> if (...)
 {
     return ...;
 }
 else
 {
     return ...;
 }
</code></pre>

<p>preferring the (subjective) much cleaner looking python counter-part</p>

<pre><code>if ...:
    return ...
else
    return ...
</code></pre>

<p>is there any way I can go about hiding these braces (as they do take up about 30% of my coding screen on average and just look ugly!)</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-9):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Sorry, but if you're coding in C# and doing more than just simple single-expression blocks, you're going to have to suck it up.  Python's "indent-denotes-scope" grammar may be nice, but it's Python, not C#.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You could switch to: </p>

<pre><code> if (...) {
     return ...;
 } else {
     return ...;
 }
</code></pre>

<p>to gain some screen.</p>

<p>I think it's a bad idea to pretend that C# works like Python though.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><pre><code>if (condition) {
    statement1
    statement2; }
else {
    statement3;
    statemen4; }
</code></pre>

<p>much uglier in my opinion :(</p>

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Well, you can omit the braces in C#, so long as the <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> "blocks" are just single statements:</p>

<pre><code>// perfectly legal
if (...)
    return ...
else
    return ...
</code></pre>

<p>If you need multi-line <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> blocks then you're stuck with braces.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><ol>
<li><p>You don't need the brackets if you have only one statement. For example, the following is working:</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
    if (i == 9)
        break;
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>(even though that code does not make any sense)</p>

<li>You can change the settings in Visual C# for formatting C# code as Skilldrick says, to make the code shorter:</li>
</ol>

<p>Go to Tools -> Options -> Text Editor -> C# -> formatting (or something similar, I only have the german version of visual studio).</p>

<p>Hope that helps</p>

<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>C/C++/Java/C# folks have an ages old racist kind of family feud with the Cobol/BASIC/Python clan. It's a real either/or thing... No best-of-the-both-world's, having-cakes-and-eating-them-too fun allowed :)</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>For single statements you do not need the curly braces. For times you need them you might be OK with placing the braces like:</p>

<pre><code>if(expr) {
    ...
} else {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
