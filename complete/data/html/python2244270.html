<h3>Question (ID-2244270):</h3><h2>Get a Try statement to loop around until correct value obtained</h2><p>I am trying to get a user to enter a number between 1 and 4. I have code to check if the number is correct but I want the code to loop around several times until the numbers is correct. Does anyone know how to do this? The code is below:</p>

<pre><code>def Release():


    try:
        print 'Please select one of the following?\nCompletion = 0\nRelease ID = 1\nVersion ID = 2\nBuild ID = 3\n'
        a = int(input("Please select the type of release required: "))
        if a == 0:
            files(a)
        elif a == 1:
            files(a)
        elif a == 2:
            files(a)
        elif a == 3:
            files(a)
        else:
            raise 'incorrect'
    except 'incorrect':    
        print 'Try Again'
    except:
        print 'Error'

Release()
</code></pre>

<p>I am also getting an error about the exception I have entered:</p>

<pre><code>kill.py:20: DeprecationWarning: catching of string exceptions is deprecated
  except 'incorrect':
Error
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks for any help</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Your approach seems to be a very long-winded way to accomplish something fairly simple:</p>

<pre><code>def Release() :
    while True :
        print 'Please select one of the following?\nCompletion = 0\nRelease ID = 1\nVersion ID = 2\nBuild ID = 3\n'
        a = int(input("Please select the type of release required: "))
        if 0 &lt;= a &lt; 4 :
            files(a)
            break
        else :
            print('Try Again')
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Modern Python exceptions are classes; by using <code>raise 'incorrect'</code>, you are using a deprecated language feature called string exceptions. The <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/errors.html" rel="nofollow">Errors and Exceptions</a> section of the Python tutorial would be a good place to start with basic exception handling in Python.</p>

<p>In general, exceptions are not ideal for your situation anywayâ€”a simple <code>while</code> loop should be sufficient. Exceptions should be reserved for exceptional situations, and bad user input is not exceptional, it's expected.</p>

<p>The loop-based version of <code>Release</code> would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>def Release():
    a = None
    while a not in (0, 1, 2, 3):
        print 'Please select one of the following?\nCompletion = 0\nRelease ID = 1\nVersion ID = 2\nBuild ID = 3\n'
        try:
            a = int(input("Please select the type of release required: "))
        except ValueError:
            pass  # Could happen in face of bad user input
    files(a)
</code></pre>

<p>P.S. <code>a</code> is a bad variable name; you should probably change it to <code>chosen_option</code> or something like that.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Instead of using exceptions you could do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>...
a = raw_input("Please select the type of release required:")
while a not in ['0','1','2','3']: a = raw_input("Try again: ")
files(int(a))
...
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You are both throwing and catching the exception in the same simple block of code - this is not really what exception handling is about. You can do it better either by breaking out of a loop or by keeping a condition. E.g.:</p>

<pre><code>def isNumberCorrect(x):
   return x in range(4)

def Release():
    num = None # incorrect

    while not isNumberCorrect(num):
        print 'Please select one of the following?\nCompletion = 0\nRelease ID = 1\nVersion ID = 2\nBuild ID = 3\n'
        num_str = raw_input("Please select the type of release required: ")

        try:
            num = int(num_str)
        except ValueError:
            num = None

        if not isNumberCorrect(num):
            print 'Incorrect!'

     # work with num here; it's guaranteed to be correct.

if __name__ == '__main__':
  try:
    Release()
  except:
    print 'Error!'
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Added error checking in the int parsing.</p>
