<h3>Question (ID-2717856):</h3><h2>Any good and gentle Python regexp tutorials out there?</h2><p>I read through the official <a href="http://docs.python.org/howto/regex.html" rel="nofollow">regular expression howto</a> which wasn't gentle enough for me. Is there anything better/easier out there?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I liked the <a href="http://code.google.com/edu/languages/google-python-class/regular-expressions.html">section on regular expressions</a> from Google's Python class. There's also the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWyoYtvJpe4">video</a> for this section. I thought it was pretty gentle.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>This isn't python specific, but looks like a good introduction:</p>

<p><a href="http://immike.net/blog/2007/04/06/the-absolute-bare-minimum-every-programmer-should-know-about-regular-expressions/" rel="nofollow">The absolute bare minimum every programmer should know about regular expressions</a></p>

<p>Truthfully, I've always ever referred to the python documentation for regex and never read the above article (I only seem to have bookmarked it at some point). Anyway, it seems to cover all the basics. There are even 2 follow-up posts linked at the end for more advanced uses.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I personally use the tutorial at <a href="http://www.amk.ca/python/howto/regex/" rel="nofollow">http://www.amk.ca/python/howto/regex/</a> combined with <a href="http://kodos.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">Kodos</a>, a free python regular expression debugger for testing and experimenting.</p>

<p>I often also use the <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/059600415X" rel="nofollow">regular expressions pocket reference</a>, though it's not free.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>This may not be a tutorial, but perhaps a try to go through the RE exercises at the bottom of this page may help your learning curve : <a href="http://www.upriss.org.uk/python/PythonCourse.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.upriss.org.uk/python/PythonCourse.html</a></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I'm guessing you're new to regular expressions? Maybe <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=introduction+to+regular+expressions&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3aen-GB%3aofficial&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">one of these</a> might help?</p>

<p>Get your understanding of them solid first - have a play with <a href="http://regexpal.com/" rel="nofollow">Regexpal</a> to firm up your understanding and then have another look at the Python implementation.</p>

<p>If you've got something specific in mind that you want to solve, post it and maybe we can give some examples to help you understand it.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>To understand the regular expressions first check <a href="http://weitz.de/regex-coach/" rel="nofollow">here</a> and try <a href="http://weitz.de/regex-coach/" rel="nofollow">Regex Coach</a>
But before these do not forget to  search regex in stackoverflow.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>The <a href="http://diveintopython.org/regular_expressions/index.html" rel="nofollow">Regular Expression chapter</a> from <a href="http://diveintopython.org/" rel="nofollow">Dive Into Python</a> has a good introduction. Also, see the <a href="http://www.pythonregex.com/" rel="nofollow">Python Regular Expression Testing Tool</a> to run expressions interactively via a browser.</p>
