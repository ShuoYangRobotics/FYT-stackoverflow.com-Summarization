<h3>Question (ID-1518659):</h3><h2>Python and indentation, having touble getting started</h2><p>I have just started learning python and am getting caught up. I come from mostly C background.  </p>

<pre><code>class Alarm:

    def timer():

    def main():
    	print ("Timer has Started")

    main()
</code></pre>

<p>I always get a silly error when I try to run this code::</p>

<pre><code>alarm &gt; python alarm.py 
  File "alarm.py", line 5
    def main():
      ^
IndentationError: expected an indented block
</code></pre>

<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-9):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You have an empty def</p>

<pre><code>def timer():
</code></pre>

<p>use</p>

<pre><code>def timer():
    pass
</code></pre>

<p>instead.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Learn about the <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/simple%5Fstmts.html#the-pass-statement" rel="nofollow"><code>pass</code> statement</a>, <code>main</code> is usually not part of the class.</p>

<p>A global (module level) <code>main()</code> function is simpler than an <code>Alarm.main()</code> class method. Usually, <code>main()</code> functions come at module level.</p>

<pre><code>class Alarm:

    def timer():
        pass

def main():
    print ("Timer has Started")

main()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>try deindent main() and add pass to timer and define an init method:</p>

<pre><code>class Alarm():

    def __init__(self):
        print ("Timer has Started")

&lt;shell&gt;$  Alarm()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Your timer function is not defined. (And your space/tab indentation may be mixed)</p>

<p>See the tutorial (<a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/classes.html#class-objects" rel="nofollow">classes</a>) for more details on classes.</p>

<pre><code>class Alarm:

    def timer(self):
        pass
    def main(self):
        print ("Timer has Started")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    class_inst = Alarm()
    class_inst.main()
</code></pre>

<p>If you getting into python read <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow">PEP8</a>.<br />
Also, using <a href="http://www.logilab.org/857" rel="nofollow">pylint</a> helps, it will point out indentation and many other errors you'll run across before you 'execute' your code.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I think you want to use <code>__init__</code> though, which is the constructor...</p>

<pre><code>class Alarm:

    def timer(self): 
        print('timer has started')

    def __init__(self): 
        print('constructor')
        self.timer()


x = Alarm()
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>constructor</p>
  
  <p>timer has started</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My example differs from the others in that I'm actually instantiating a new object.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>specify <code>self</code> as the first argument to any method defined in the class</li>
<li><code>__init__</code> is the method to define for the constructor</li>
<li>invoke the class by doing variableName = className() like you would invoke a function, no <code>new</code> keyword</li>
<li>if you have an empty function, use the <code>pass</code> keyword like <code>def foo(self): pass</code></li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Invoking main() will give an <em>undefined function error</em>, as it is a Alarm method.</p>

<p>IMHO the right form you should use is the following:</p>

<pre><code>class Alarm:
    def timer():
      pass

    @staticmethod
    def main():
      print ("Timer has Started")

if __name__ == "__main__" :
    Alarm.main()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>As others have pointed out, you have a syntax error because timer() has no body.</p>

<p>You don't need to use main() in python at all. Usually people use it to indicate that the file is the top level program and not a module to be imported, but it is just by convention</p>

<p>You may also see this idiom</p>

<pre><code>def main():
    blah blah

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
</code></pre>

<p>Here <code>__name__</code> is a special variable. If the file has been imported it will contain the module name, so the comparison fails and main does not run.</p>

<p>For the top level program <code>__name__</code> contains "<code>__main__</code>" so the main() function will be run.</p>

<p>This is useful because sometimes your module might run tests when it is loaded as a program but you don't want those test to run if you are importing it into a larger program</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>In Python, you don't need to define everything as a class. There's nothing to encapsulate in this code, so there's no reason to define an Alarm class. Just have the functions in a module.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>Thanks for all the help everybody.  I was making a little alarm/timer to remind me to get up and take a walk every now and then.  I got most of it working, and it works great.  Checked it against a stop watch and it works great.  </p>

<pre><code>import time

def timer(num):
    seconds = num*60
    print (num , "minutes", seconds , "seconds")

    while (seconds &gt; 0):
    	print (seconds, "seconds")
    	time.sleep(1)
    	seconds = seconds-1

    print ("Time to get up and take a WALK!!!!")
    main()


def main():
    number = input("Input time : ")
    int(number)
    timer(number)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</code></pre>
