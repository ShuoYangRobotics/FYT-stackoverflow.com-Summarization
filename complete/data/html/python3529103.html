<h3>Question (ID-3529103):</h3><h2>Question for join</h2><p>I have no clue about python and started to use it on some files.
I managed to find out how to do all the things that I need except for 2 things.
<code>Ipadd = string.join (line['0,1,2,4,5,6'])</code> does not work if I make it (<code>line[0:2]</code>)
It prints out the first two fields and thats good so far but I need field 4 and 6 also.
but (<code>line[0:2:4:6]</code>) is not working and different other things that I tryed.
How can I accomplish this? similar to <code>awk '{ print $1 $2 $5 $7 }'</code></p>

<p>2nd 
how can I delete the last character of the line. There is an additional <code>'</code> that I don't need.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Provided the join here is just to have a nice string to print or store as result (with a coma as separator, in the OP example it would have been whatever was in string).</p>

<pre><code>line = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G']

print ','.join (line[0:2])
</code></pre>

<p>A,B</p>

<pre><code>print ','.join (line[i] for i in [0,1,2,4,5,6])
</code></pre>

<p>A,B,C,E,F,G</p>

<p>What you are doing in both cases is extracting a sublist from the initial list. The first one use a slice, the second one use a list comprehension. As others said you could also have accessed to elements one by one, the above syntaxes are merely shorthands for: </p>

<pre><code>print ','.join ([line[0], line[1]])
</code></pre>

<p>A,B</p>

<pre><code>print ','.join ([line[0], line[1], line[2], line[4], line[5], line[6]])
</code></pre>

<p>A,B,C,E,F,G</p>

<p>I believe some short tutorial on list slices could be helpfull:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>l[x:y]</code> is a 'slice' of list l. It will get all elements between position x (included) and position y (excluded). Positions starts at 0. If y is out of list or missing, it will include all list until the end. If you use negative numbers you count from the end of the list. You can also use a third parameter like in <code>l[x:y:step]</code> if you want to 'jump over' some items (not take them in the slice) with a regular interval.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<pre><code>l = range(1, 100) # create a list of 99 integers from 1 to 99
l[:]    # resulting slice is a copy of the list
l[0:]   # another way to get a copy of the list
l[0:99] # as we know the number of items, we could also do that
l[0:0]  # a new empty list (remember y is excluded]
l[0:1]  # a new list that contains only the first item of the old list
l[0:2]  # a new list that contains only the first two items of the old list
l[0:-1] # a new list that contains all the items of the old list, except the last
l[0:len(l)-1] # same as above but less clear 
l[0:-2] # a new list that contains all the items of the old list, except the last two
l[0:len(l)-2] # same as above but less clear
l[1:-1] # a new list with first and last item of the original list removed
l[-2:] # a list that contains the last two items of the original list
l[0::2] # odd numbers
l[1::2] # even numbers
l[2::3] # multiples of 3
</code></pre>

<p>If rules to get items are more complex, you'll use a <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0202/" rel="nofollow">list comprehension</a> instead of a slice, but it's another subjet. That's what I use in my second join example.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You don't want to use <code>join</code> for that. If you just want to print some bits of a list, then specify the ones you want directly:</p>

<pre><code>print '%s %s %s %s' % (line[0], line[1], line[4], line[6])
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Assuming that the <code>line</code> variable should contain a line of cells, separated by commas...</p>

<p>You can use <code>map</code> for that:</p>

<pre><code>line = "1,2,3,4,5,6"
cells = line.split(",")
indices=[0,1,4,6]
selected_elements = map( lambda i: cells[i], indices )
print ",".join(selected_elements)
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>map</code> function will do the on-the-fly function for each of the indices in the list argument.  (Reorder to your liking)</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You could use the following using list comprehension :</p>

<pre><code>indices = [0,1,4,6]
Ipadd = string.join([line[i] for i in xrange(len(line)) if i in indices])
</code></pre>

<p>Note : You could also use :</p>

<pre><code>Ipadd = string.join([line[i] for i in indices])
</code></pre>

<p>but you will need a sorted list of indices without repetition of course.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><pre><code>l = []
l.extend(line[0:2])
l.append(line[5]) # fourth field
l.append(line[7]) # sixth field
string.join(l)
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively</p>

<pre><code>"{l[0]} {l[1]} {l[4]} {l[5]}".format(l=line)
</code></pre>

<p>Please <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3101/" rel="nofollow">see PEP 3101</a> and stop using the <code>%</code> operator for string formatting.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; token = ':'
&gt;&gt;&gt; s = '1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8:9:10'
&gt;&gt;&gt; sp = s.split(token)
&gt;&gt;&gt; token.join(filter(bool, map(lambda i: i in [0,2,4,6] and sp[i] or False, range(len(sp)))))
'1:3:5:7'
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Answer to the second question:</p>

<p>If your string is contained in <code>myLine</code>, just do:</p>

<pre><code>myLline = myLine[:-1]
</code></pre>

<p>to remove the last character.</p>

<p>Or you could also use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#str.rstrip" rel="nofollow"><code>rstrip()</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>myLine = myLine.rstrip("'")
</code></pre>
