<h3>Question (ID-1889967):</h3><h2>Setting Python path while developing library module</h2><p>I am developing a library and an application that uses the library in Python 2.6.  I've placed a "mylib.pth" file in "site-packages" so that I can <code>import mylib</code> from within my application.  </p>

<p>I am using a DVCS so when I want to fix a bug or add a feature to the library I make a branch of the repository and work within that branch.  To test my application with the changes I am making to the library I edit the path in "mylib.pth" to point to the new development branch.</p>

<p>This gets a little tedious if I have a few parallel branches of my library going on at one.  I have to keep editing the "mylib.pth" file before testing to ensure I am testing against the correct version of my library.  Is there a way to use the current path (i.e. the development branch of the library that I am current in) to set the library path when I invoke my application instead of using the "mylib.pth" in the global "site-packages" directory?</p>

It addresses a number of problems with development and deployment of Python apps.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Is <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv" rel="nofollow">virtualenv</a> what you're looking for?  From the description:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imagine you have an application that
  needs version 1 of LibFoo, but another
  application requires version 2. How
  can you use both these applications?
  If you install everything into
  /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages (or
  whatever your platform's standard
  location is), it's easy to end up in a
  situation where you unintentionally
  upgrade an application that shouldn't
  be upgraded.</p>
</blockquote>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If you use setuptools, then you can say <code>setup.py develop</code> in your working tree, and it will do the .pth file manipulation for you.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Sure, you can alter <code>sys.path</code> to add the current directory (or a subdirectory of it) to the search path. <code>site.addsitedir</code> is a good way to do it. Since you'd be doing this from Python you can have any sort of logic you like for deciding which directory to add; you could base it on <code>os.path.normpath</code>â€‹ing the current directory if it looks like a branch, or looking for the newest branch on-disc, or something else.</p>

<p>You could put this code in the <code>sitecustomize.py</code> module or other startup-triggered location.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You might also consider using <a href="http://jacobian.org/writing/django-apps-with-buildout/" rel="nofollow">zc.buildout</a>.  It allows you to create entry points with customized python paths.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I set my <code>PYTHONPATH</code> to point to the latest-and-greatest version.  No editing.</p>

<pre><code>export PYTHONPATH=.:/the/new/version
</code></pre>
