<h3>Question (ID-1058434):</h3><h2>Flags in Python</h2><p>I'm working with a large matrix (250x250x30 = 1,875,000 cells), and I'd like a way to set an arbitrary number of flags for each cell in this matrix, in some manner that's easy to use and reasonably space efficient.</p>

<p>My original plan was a 250x250x30 list array, where each element was something like: <code>["FLAG1","FLAG8","FLAG12"]</code>. I then changed it to storing just integers instead: <code>[1,8,12]</code>. These integers are mapped internally by getter/setter functions to the original flag strings. This only uses 250mb with 8 flags per point, which is fine in terms of memory.</p>

<p>My question is: am I missing another obvious way to structure this sort of data?</p>

<p>Thanks all for your suggestions. I ended up rolling a few suggestions into one, sadly I can only pick one answer and have to live with upvoting the others:</p>

<p>EDIT: erm the initial code I had here (using sets as the base element of a 3d numpy array) used A LOT of memory. This new version uses around 500mb when filled with <code>randint(0,2**1000)</code>.</p>

<pre><code>import numpy

FLAG1=2**0
FLAG2=2**1
FLAG3=2**2
FLAG4=2**3

(x,y,z) = (250,250,30)

array = numpy.zeros((x,y,z), dtype=object)


def setFlag(location,flag):
    array[location] |= flag
def unsetFlag(location,flag):
    array[location] &amp;= ~flag
</code></pre>

However if you are working with a sparse dataset where only a small subsection of your cells will have flags what you really want is a dictionary.  You would want to set up the dictonary so the key is a tuple for the location of the cell and the value is a list of flags like you have in your solution.</p>

<pre><code>allFlags = {(1,1,1):[1,2,3], (250,250,30):[4,5,6]}
</code></pre>

<p>Here we have the 1,1,1 cell have the flags 1,2, and 3 and the cell 250,250,30 have the flags 4,5, and 6</p>

<p>edit- fixed key tuples, thanks Andre, and dictionary syntax.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You can define some constants with different, power of two values as:</p>

<pre><code>FLAG1 = 0x01
FLAG8 = 0x02
FLAG12 = 0x04
...
</code></pre>

<p>And use them with boolean logic to store the flags in only one integer, p.e.:</p>

<pre><code>flags = FLAG1 | FLAG8
</code></pre>

<p>To check if a flag is enabled, you can use the <code>&amp;</code> operator:</p>

<pre><code>flag1_enabled = flags &amp; FLAG1
</code></pre>

<p>If the flag is enabled, this expression will return a non-zero value, that will be evaluated as True in any boolean operation. If the flag is disabled, the expression will return 0, that is evaluated as False in boolean operations.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I would generally use a <a href="http://numpy.scipy.org/" rel="nofollow">numpy</a> array (presumably of short ints, 2 bytes each, since you may need more than 256 distinct values) -- that would take less than 4MB for the &lt;2 million cells.</p>

<p>If for some reason I couldn't afford the numpy dependency (e.g on App Engine, which doesn't support numpy), I'd use the standard library <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/array.html" rel="nofollow">array</a> module - it only supports 1-dimensional arrays, but it's just as space-efficient as numpy for large homogeneous arrays, and the getter/setter routines you mention can perfectly well "linearize" a 3-items tuple that's your natural index into the single integer index into the 1-D array.</p>

<p>In general, consider numpy (or array) any time you have large homogeneous, dense vectors or matrices of numbers -- Python built-in lists are highly wasteful of space in this use case (due to their generality which you're not using and don't need here!-), and saving memory indirectly translates to saving time too (better caching, fewer levels of indirection, etc, etc).</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Consider using Flyweight pattern to share cell properties:</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyweight%5Fpattern" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyweight_pattern</a></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit%5Farray" rel="nofollow">BitSet</a> is what you want, since it allows you to store many flags at once using only an fixed size integer (Int type)</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Taking Robbie's suggestion one step further...</p>

<pre><code>flags = set()
x, y, flag = 34, 201, 3
flags.add((x, y, flag)) # set flag 3 at position (34, 201)
if (3, 2, 1) in flags: # check if flag 1 is at position (3, 2)
    # do something
else:
    # do something else
</code></pre>

<p>You can also create a helper class.</p>

<pre><code>class Flags(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = set()
    def add(self, x, y, flag):
        self.data.add((x, y, flag))
    def remove(self, x, y, flag):
        self.data.remove((x, y, flag))
    def contains(self, x, y, flag):
        return (x, y, flag) in self.data
</code></pre>

<p>You could also implement Python's special methods like <code>__contains__</code> to make it easier to work with.</p>
