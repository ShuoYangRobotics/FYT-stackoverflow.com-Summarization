<h3>Question (ID-805072):</h3><h2>Server Side Google Markers Clustering - Python/Django</h2><p>After experimenting with client side approach to clustering large numbers of Google markers I decided that it won't be possible for my project (social network with 28,000+ users).</p>

<p>Are there any examples of clustering the coordinates on the server side - preferably in Python/Django?</p>

<p>The way I would like this to work is to gradually index the markers based on their proximity (radius) and zoom level. </p>

<p>In another words when a new user registers he/she is automatically assigned to a certain 'group' of markers that are close to each other thus increasing the 'group's' counter. What's being send to the server is just a small number of 'groups'. Only when the zoom level/scale of map is 1:1 - actual users are shown on the map. </p>

<p>That way the client side will have to deal only with 10-50 markers per request/zoom level. </p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://www.appelsiini.net/2008/11/introduction-to-marker-clustering-with-google-maps" rel="nofollow">This tutorial</a> demonstrates a basic server-side clustering function.  It's written in PHP for the Static Maps API, but you could use it as a starting point.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I wrote a blog post about my approach using Python and Django here:</p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You might want to take a look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN" rel="nofollow">DBSCAN</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPTICS_algorithm" rel="nofollow">OPTICS</a> pages on wikipedia, these looks very suitable for clustering places on a map. There is also a page about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis" rel="nofollow">Cluster Analysis</a> that shows all the possible algorithms you can use, most would be trivial to implement using the language of your choice.</p>

<p>With 28k+ points, you might want to skip django and just jump into C/C++ directly, and surely not expect this to get calculated in real-time in response to web requests.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>One way to do it would be to define a grid with a unit size based on the zoom level.  So you collect up all the items within a grid by lat,lon to one decimal place.  An example is 42.2x73.4.  So a point at 42.2003x73.4021 falls in that grid cell.  That cell is bounded by 42.2x73.3 and 42.2x73.5.</p>

<p>If there are one or more points in a grid cell, you place a marker in the center of that grid.</p>

<p>You then hook up the zoomend event and change your grid size accordingly, and redraw the markers.</p>

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You could simply drop decimals based on the zoom level. Would that work for you?</p>

<p>Our geo indexes are based on morton numbers:
<a href="http://www.rooftopsolutions.nl/article/231" rel="nofollow">http://www.rooftopsolutions.nl/article/231</a> (shameless self promotion).</p>

<p>If you want more precision than the 10-base system, the morton number will allow you to increase the zoom level on a 2-base number system, simply by doing something like:</p>

<p>GROUP BY (morton XOR (-precision))</p>

<p>The higher precision gets, the more items will be clustered.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I am using Django and Python to cluster real estate and rental listings, and the source can be found <a href="http://forum.mapaplace.com/discussion/3/server-side-marker-clustering-python-source-code/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>Hope it helps!</p>
