<h3>Question (ID-3434048):</h3><h2>How to Pass variables to python script?</h2><p>I know it can be achieved by command line but I need to pass at least 10 variables and command line will mean too much of programming since these variables may or may not be passed.</p>

<p>Actually I have build A application half in vB( for GUI ) and Half in python( for script ). I need to pass variables to python, similar, to its keywords arguments, i.e, x = val1, y = val2. Is there any way to achieve this?</p>

optparse is deprecated though, and in 2.7 you should use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/argparse.html#module-argparse" rel="nofollow">argparse</a></p>

<p>It makes passing named parameters a breeze.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Have you taken a look at the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/getopt.html" rel="nofollow">getopt module</a>? It's designed to make working with command line options easier. See also the examples at  <a href="http://www.faqs.org/docs/diveintopython/kgp_commandline.html" rel="nofollow">Dive Into Python</a>.</p>

<p>If you are working with Python 2.7 (and not lower), than you can also have a look at the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/argparse.html#module-argparse" rel="nofollow">argparse module</a> which should make it even easier.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If your script is not called too often, you can use a configuration file. </p>

<p><a href="http://docs.python.org/library/configparser.html" rel="nofollow">The .ini style is easily readable by ConfigParser</a>:</p>

<pre><code>[Section_1]
foo1=1
foo2=2
foo3=5
...

[Section_2]
bar1=1
bar2=2
bar3=3
...
</code></pre>

<p>If you have a serious amount of variables, it might be the right way to go.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Since you're working on windows with VB, it's worth mentioning that <a href="http://ironpython.net/" rel="nofollow">IronPython</a> might be one option.  Since both VB and IronPython can interact through .NET, you could wrap up your script in an assembly and expose a function which you call with the required arguments.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>you can do something fun like call it as</p>

<pre><code>thepyscript.py "x = 12,y = 'hello world', z = 'jam'"
</code></pre>

<p>and inside your script,</p>

<p>parse do:</p>

<pre><code>stuff = arg[1].split(',')
for item in stuff:
    exec(item) #or eval(item) depending on how complex you get 
#Exec can be a lot of fun :) In fact with this approach you could potentially  
#send functions to your script.
#If this is more than you need, then i'd stick w/ arg/optparse
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>What do you think about creating a python script setting these variables from the gui side? When starting the python app you just start this script and you have your vars.</p>
