<h3>Question (ID-1085337):</h3><h2>LINQ in Python</h2><p>Is there any LINQ-like project for Python that can automatically query XML files and/or RDBMS tables? The syntax does not have to be exactly like LINQ in C#, but hopefully close in a pythonic way. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Microsoft created Linq (Language Integrated Query) using Expression trees, which is a math concept on how to parse operations into trees in a way that you can analyze the operations independently from the result.</p>
  
  <p>Pynq is an implementation in Python of the Expression Tree theory and some of the providers. There will be more providers gradually, but Pynq will strive to make it as easy as possible to write your own provider.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I'm not an expert, but the Dejavu people claims Dejavu makes much of what LINQ does, and did it way before LINQ. Could be worth checking out:</p>

<p>It allows using generator expressions to query an SQL database.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You may want to look at kalamar: <a href="http://dyko.org/api/kalamar.html" rel="nofollow">http://dyko.org/api/kalamar.html</a></p>

<p>It is an unified data access library using a syntax more or less similar to linq for accessing data stored in different format (xml, mp3, ...) on heterogeneous backend (files, sql, ...).</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I haven't used it yet, but this shows promise:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://code.google.com/p/asq/" rel="nofollow">asq</a> is a simple implementation of a LINQ-inspired API for Python which operates over Python iterables, including a parallel version implemented in terms of the Python standard library multiprocessing module. The API sports feature equivalence with LINQ for objects, 100% statement test coverage and <a href="http://docs.asq.googlecode.com/hg/html/index.html" rel="nofollow">comprehensive documentation</a>.</p>
