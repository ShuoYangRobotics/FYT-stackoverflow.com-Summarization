<h3>Question (ID-1138024):</h3><h2>Get first non-empty string from a list in python</h2><p>In Python I have a list of strings, some of which may be the empty string. What's the best way to get the first non-empty string?</p>

<p>Edit: py3k proof version as advised by Stephan202 in comments, thanks. </p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><pre><code>def get_nonempty(list_of_strings):
    for s in list_of_strings:
        if s:
            return s
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>To remove all empty strings,</p>

<p><code>[s for s in list_of_strings if s]</code></p>

<p>To get the first non-empty string, simply create this list and get the first element, or use the lazy method as suggested by wuub.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Here's a short way:</p>

<pre><code>filter(None, list_of_strings)[0]
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Here's a slightly longer way that is better:</p>

<pre><code>from itertools import ifilter
ifilter(None, list_of_strings).next()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>to get the first non empty string in a list, you just have to loop over it and check if its not empty. that's all there is to it.</p>

<pre><code>arr = ['','',2,"one"]
for i in arr:
    if i:
        print i
        break
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Based on your question I'll have to assume a lot, but to "get" the first non-empty string:</p>

<pre><code>(i for i, s in enumerate(x) if s).next()
</code></pre>

<p>which returns its index in the list. The 'x' binding points to your list of strings.</p>
