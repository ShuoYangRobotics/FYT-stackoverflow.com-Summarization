<h3>Question (ID-1156819):</h3><h2>Looking for Python gui</h2><p>I'm looking for the right Python gui library for a program I'm writing.  I'm looking for one that is:
<p>1. free
<p>2. licensed so that I can sell the product I create
<p>3. good looking (could you link to screen shot examples, if possible?)</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/GUI%20Programming%20in%20Python" rel="nofollow">GUI Programming in Python</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Most of the home pages for those libraries have screen shots and samples you can run after downloading the library.</p>

<p>I've used wxPython with success and like it a fair bit.  I also hear good thing about PyQT constantly.  Both can be used to produce well finished products, I think.</p>

<p>Some more information on both <a href="http://diotavelli.net/PyQtWiki" rel="nofollow">PyQT</a> and <a href="http://www.wxpython.org/" rel="nofollow">wxPython</a> is available on the Python Wiki:</p>

<li><a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/WxPython" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.python.org/moin/WxPython</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Both libraries have their own license and I'm afraid I can't tell you much more about that.  (I know you can get a commercial license for PyQT, but do not know the costs involved.)</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>If you want it to be both free and distributable as a commercial application, then wxPython is the way to go. Although the C++ version of Qt has switched from the GPL to LGPL license, PyQT is still GPL'ed.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>wxPython is easy to learn and looks decent.
This <a href="http://www.zetcode.com/wxpython/" rel="nofollow">tutorial</a> is very complete.</p>

<p>In case you want to try something else, there's this <a href="http://zetcode.com/tutorials/pyqt4/" rel="nofollow">PyQT</a> tutorial and this <a href="http://zetcode.com/tutorials/pygtktutorial/" rel="nofollow">PyGTK</a> tutorial from the same site. They look pretty decent too.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I'd definately start out with wxpython, it's easy and just uses the operating system widget styles so it looks pretty good on windows/linux/mac</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I am suprised noone has mentioned it yet, but pygtk is a strong option as well.  <a href="http://www.pygtk.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.pygtk.org</a>.  The gtk api is mature and the python bindings are written to be very "pythonic"  </p>

<p>When you are looking for the gui building   <a href="http://glade.gnome.org" rel="nofollow">http://glade.gnome.org</a> is nice as well</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Personally, I found all of python native GUI technologies quirky and limiting.  </p>

<p>However, python integrates well with pretty much any technology outhere including Flash and Winforms/WPF.  I am currently building a rich UIs using Python and Winforms using Python.Net as bridge technology.  I found it very easy to use. It also let's me do all the GUI heavy lifting in Visual Studio keeping presenter, model and below logic in Python.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>pyglet (<a href="http://www.pyglet.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pyglet.org/</a>) is nice and BSD licensed, which I prefer to GPL licenses.</p>
