<h3>Question (ID-1416646):</h3><h2>pythonic way to convert variable to list</h2><p>I have a function whose input argument can either be an element or a list of elements. If this argument is a single element then I put it in a list so I can iterate over the input in a consistent manner. </p>

<p>Currently I have this:</p>

<pre><code>def my_func(input):
    if not isinstance(input, list): input = [input]
    for e in input:
        ...
</code></pre>

<p>I am working with an existing API so I can't change the input parameters. Using isinstance() feels hacky, so is there a <em>proper</em> way to do this?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Typically, strings (plain and unicode) are the only iterables that you want to nevertheless consider as "single elements" -- the <code>basestring</code> builtin exists SPECIFICALLY to let you test for either kind of strings with <code>isinstance</code>, so it's very UN-grotty for that special case;-).</p>

<p>So my suggested approach for the most general case is:</p>

<pre><code>  if isinstance(input, basestring): input = [input]
  else:
    try: iter(input)
    except TypeError: input = [input]
    else: input = list(input)
</code></pre>

<p>This is THE way to treat EVERY iterable EXCEPT strings as a list directly, strings and numbers and other non-iterables as scalars (to be normalized into single-item lists).</p>

<p>I'm explicitly making a list out of every kind of iterable so you KNOW you can further on perform EVERY kind of list trick - sorting, iterating more than once, adding or removing items to facilitate iteration, etc, all without altering the ACTUAL input list (if list indeed it was;-). If all you need is a single plain <code>for</code> loop then that last step is unnecessary (and indeed unhelpful if e.g. input is a huge open file) and I'd suggest an auxiliary generator instead:</p>

<pre><code>def justLoopOn(input):
  if isinstance(input, basestring):
    yield input
  else:
    try:
      for item in input:
        yield item
    except TypeError:
      yield input
</code></pre>

<p>now in every single one of your functions needing such argument normalization, you just use:</p>

<pre><code> for item in justLoopOn(input):
</code></pre>

<p>You can use an auxiliary normalizing-function even in the other case (where you need a real list for further nefarious purposes); actually, in such (rarer) cases, you can just do:</p>

<pre><code> thelistforme = list(justLoopOn(input))
</code></pre>

<p>so that the (inevitably) somewhat-hairy normalization logic is just in ONE place, just as it should be!-)</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I like Andrei Vajna's suggestion of <code>hasattr(var,'__iter__')</code>.  Note these results from some typical Python types:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; hasattr("abc","__iter__")
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; hasattr((0,),"__iter__")
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; hasattr({},"__iter__")
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; hasattr(set(),"__iter__")
True
</code></pre>

<p>This has the added advantage of treating a string as a non-iterable - strings are a grey area, as sometimes you want to treat them as an element, other times as a sequence of characters.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You can put * before your argument, this way you'll always get a tuple:</p>

<pre><code>def a(*p):
  print type(p)
  print p

a(4)
&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;type 'tuple'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; (4,)

a(4, 5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;type 'tuple'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; (4,5,)
</code></pre>

<p>But that will force you to call your function with variable parameters, I don't know if that 's acceptable for you.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You can do direct type comparisons using <code>type()</code>.</p>

<pre><code>def my_func(input):
    if not type(input) is list:
        input = [input]
    for e in input:
        # do something
</code></pre>

<p>However, the way you have it will allow <em>any</em> type derived from the <code>list</code> type to be passed through.  Thus preventing the any derived types from accidentally being wrapped.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Your aproach seems right to me.</p>

<p>It's similar to how you use <code>atom?</code> in Lisp when you iterate over lists and check the current item to see if it is a list or not, because if it is a list you want to process its items, too.</p>

<p>So, yeah, don't see anything wrong with that.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>That is an ok way to do it (don't forget to include tuples).</p>

<p>However, you may also want to consider if the argument has a __iter__ <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html#object.%5F%5Fiter%5F%5F" rel="nofollow">method</a> or __getitem__ <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html#object.%5F%5Fgetitem%5F%5F" rel="nofollow">method</a>. (note that strings have __getitem__ instead of __iter__.)</p>

<pre><code>hasattr(arg, '__iter__') or hasattr(arg, '__getitem__')
</code></pre>

<p>This is probably the most general requirement for a list-like type than only checking the type.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>First, there is no general method that could tell a "single element" from "list of elements" since by definition list can be an element of another list.</p>

<p>I would say you need to define what kinds of data you might have, so that you might have:</p>

<ul>
<li>any descendant of <code>list</code> against anything else
<ul>
<li>Test with <code>isinstance(input, list)</code> (so your example is correct)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>any sequence type except strings (<code>basestring</code> in Python 2.x, <code>str</code> in Python 3.x)
<ul>
<li>Use sequence metaclass: <code>isinstance(myvar, collections.Sequence) and not isinstance(myvar, str)</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>some sequence type against known cases, like <code>int</code>, <code>str</code>, <code>MyClass</code>
<ul>
<li>Test with <code>isinstance(input, (int, str, MyClass))</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>any iterable except strings:
<ul>
<li>Test with </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>.</p>

<pre><code>    try: 
        input = iter(input) if not isinstance(input, str) else [input]
    except TypeError:
        input = [input]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>This seems like a reasonable way to do it. You're wanting to test if the element is a list, and this accomplishes that directly. It gets more complicated if you want to support other 'list-like' data types, too, for example:</p>

<pre><code>isinstance(input, (list, tuple))
</code></pre>

<p>or more generally, abstract away the question:</p>

<pre><code>def iterable(obj):
  try:
    len(obj)
    return True
  except TypeError:
    return False
</code></pre>

<p>but again, in summary, your method is simple and correct, which sounds good to me!</p>
