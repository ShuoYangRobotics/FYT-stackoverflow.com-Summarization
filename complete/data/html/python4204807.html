<h3>Question (ID-4204807):</h3><h2>Python: Write a program to find the time period(s) of the largest price drop(s)</h2><p>i am suppose to solve this question but i am stuck.</p>

<p>Write a program to find the time period(s) of the largest price drop(s) when a list of price(s) is given. For instance, if the list is [300,301,303,299,300,298,301,305], then there is one period of the largest price drop: from time 2 with price 303 to time 5 with price 298.</p>

<p>Below is my solution but there is a flaw</p>

<pre><code>def maxdrop(p):
  high = low = drop = newhigh = 0
  for i in range(len(p)):
    if p[i] &gt;= p[high]:
      newhigh = i # invariant: p[high] &lt;= p[newhigh]
    else: # so: p[i] &lt; p[high] &lt;= p[newhigh]
      newdrop = p[newhigh] - p[i]
      if newdrop &gt;= drop:
        high, low, drop = newhigh, i, newdrop
  return ((high, p[high]), (low, p[low]), drop)
def test():
  p = [20,22,19,20,24,18,21,24,27]
  print p, maxdrop(p)
  p = list(reversed(p))
  print p, maxdrop(p)
  if __name__ == "__main__":
  test()
</code></pre>

<p>If you try with the below list
[2,1,2,3,4,3,2]</p>

<p>the sharpest drop should occurs over 4,3,2 – the last 3 elements.
But with my code, the output is 2,1 – the first 2 elements.</p>

<p>Please assist, thanks!</p>

<p>The basic algorithm will look like this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def min_sum_subsequence(seq):
...     minsofar = 0
...     minendinghere = 0
...     for s in seq:
...         # invariant: maxendinghere and maxsofar are accurate
...         # are accurate up to s
...         minendinghere = min(minendinghere + s, 0)
...         minsofar = min(minsofar, minendinghere)
...     return minsofar
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; series = [300,301,303,299,300,298,301,305]
&gt;&gt;&gt; returns = [series[i] - series[i-1] for i in range(1, len(series))]
&gt;&gt;&gt; min_sum_subsequence(returns)
-5
</code></pre>

<p>You have to add code to keep track of the index of the start and finish.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Its always best to print all the values and check out the results.</p>

<p>The problem with your code is when you write p[i]> p[high] you update the value of newhigh but the value of high is not changing.</p>

<p>Just write it as p[i] > p[newhigh] and check out if its giving the correct results. I have'nt checked if it will give the correct output. Do that on your own.</p>

<p>Though you can always use the shortened versions mentioned above.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Python allows for much shorter code:</p>

<pre><code>l = [300,301,303,299,300,298,301,305]

max([(l[i] - l[j], i, j) for i in range(len(l)) for j in range(i, len(l))], key=lambda x:x[0])

(5, 2, 5)
</code></pre>

<p>This can maybe be shortened, but it's a good starting point.
Also, as others said, please use [homework] tag if appropriate.
Edit: this answers (drop, begin, end).</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Having copy-pasted your code and indented it, you're nearly there. Where you test:</p>

<pre><code>if p[i] &gt;= p[high]:
</code></pre>

<p>You're not considering that p[i] might be >= p[high], but less than p[newhigh].</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You are asking for the largest non-monotonically decreasing sequence.  There is a similar question for monotonically in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2310043/find-the-length-of-the-largest-increasing-sequence">this question</a>.  Lots of ways to approach this problem.  Here is a recursive approach.</p>

<pre><code>def biggest_drop(sequence):
    seq_min, seq_max = min(sequence), max(sequence)
    imin, imax = sequence.index(seq_min), sequence.index(seq_max)
    if imin == imax:
        return None
    if imin &lt; imax:
        # split the sequence and look for local drops
        drop_a = biggest_drop(sequence[:imax])
        drop_b = biggest_drop(sequence[imax:])
        if drop_a is None or drop_b is None:
            if drop_a:
                return drop_a
            return drop_b
        value_a = drop_a[0] - drop_a[-1] 
        value_b = drop_b[0] - drop_b[-1]
        if value_a &gt; value_b:
            return drop_a
        else:
            return drop_b
    return sequence[imax:imin+1]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Here is my solution:</p>

<pre><code>start_=stop_=None
min_=0
for start in range(len(li)-1):
    for stop in range(start+1, len(li)):
        tmp= li[stop]-li[start]
        if tmp&lt;min_:
            min_=tmp
            start_=start
            stop_=stop
print min_
print (start_, stop_)
</code></pre>

<p>It works for your sample.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Here's my try at it. It works correctly on all the examples that you gave. </p>

<p>I basically just go through the array and when there is a drop between two points, referring to the first point as A, look ahead until there is a value that is higher than A. I keep track of the minimum in this region. If the difference between A and the minimum is a bigger drop than what I've already found, I hold onto it. I then start looking again for a drop between two points, starting at the next point that was higher than A. </p>

<p>Here's the code. It isn't very Python-esque, but it works pretty well (I'd just go to Cython if I needed it to be faster). Also, it returns the magnitude of the drop.</p>

<pre><code>def maxdrop(p):
    bestdrop = 0
    wheredrop = -1,-1
    i = 0
    while i &lt; len(p) - 1:
        if p[i+1] &lt; p[i]:
            bestlocal = p[i+1]
            wherelocal = i+1
            j = i + 1
            while j &lt; len(p) - 1 and p[j + 1] &lt; p[i]:
                j += 1
                if p[j] &lt; bestlocal:
                    bestlocal = p[j]
                    wherelocal = j
            if p[i] - bestlocal &gt; bestdrop:
                bestdrop = p[i] - bestlocal
                wheredrop = i, wherelocal
            i = j+1
        else:
            i += 1
    return bestdrop,wheredrop
</code></pre>

<p>A big problem with your code is that you only look at the next value for the biggest drop after a new high value is found.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>There's a faster way to compute <code>mins</code> than this example, but this is concise and readable:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; data = [300, 301, 303, 299, 300, 298, 301, 305]
&gt;&gt;&gt; mins = [min(data[i:]) for (i, _) in enumerate(data)]
&gt;&gt;&gt; mins
[298, 298, 298, 298, 298, 298, 301, 305]
&gt;&gt;&gt; drops = [ d - m for (d, m) in zip(data, mins)]
&gt;&gt;&gt; drops
[2, 3, 5, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0]
&gt;&gt;&gt; [ (i, data[i] - drop) for (i, drop) in enumerate(drops) if drop == max(drops) ]
[(2, 298)]
</code></pre>

<p>Knowing that the start of the period is 2 and the low point is 298, the end of the period is:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; [ i for (i, x) in enumerate(data) if i &gt; 2 and x == 298]
[5]
</code></pre>
