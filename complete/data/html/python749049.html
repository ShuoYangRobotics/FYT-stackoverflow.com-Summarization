<h3>Question (ID-749049):</h3><h2>Passing a multi-line string as an argument to a script in Windows</h2><p>I have a simple python script like so:</p>

<pre><code>import sys

lines = sys.argv[1]

for line in lines.splitlines():
    print line
</code></pre>

<p>I want to call it from the command line (or a .bat file) but the first argument may (and probably will) be a string with multiple lines in it. How does one do this?</p>

<p>Of course, this works:</p>

<pre><code>import sys

lines = """This is a string
It has multiple lines
there are three total"""

for line in lines.splitlines():
    print line
</code></pre>

<p>But I need to be able to process an argument line-by-line.</p>

<p>EDIT: This is probably more of a Windows command-line problem than a Python problem. </p>

<p>EDIT 2: Thanks for all of the good suggestions. It doesn't look like it's possible. I can't use another shell because I'm actually trying to invoke the script from another program which seems to use the Windows command-line behind the scenes.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Just enclose the argument in quotes:</p>

<pre><code>$ python args.py "This is a string
&gt; It has multiple lines
&gt; there are three total"
This is a string
It has multiple lines
there are three total
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The following might work:</p>

<pre><code>C:\&gt; python something.py "This is a string^
More?
More? It has multiple lines^
More?
More? There are three total"
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>This is the only thing which worked for me:</p>

<pre><code>C:\&gt; python a.py This" "is" "a" "string^
More?
More? It" "has" "multiple" "lines^
More?
More? There" "are" "three" "total
</code></pre>

<p>For me <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/749049/passing-a-multi-line-string-as-an-argument-to-a-script-in-windows/749323#749323">Johannes' solution</a> invokes the python interpreter at the end of the first line, so I don't have the chance to pass additional lines.</p>

<p>But you said you are calling the python script from another process, not from the command line. Then why don't you use <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/749049/passing-a-multi-line-string-as-an-argument-to-a-script-in-windows/749319#749319">dbr' solution</a>? This worked for me as a Ruby script:</p>

<pre><code>puts `python a.py "This is a string\nIt has multiple lines\nThere are three total"`
</code></pre>

<p>And in what language are you writing the program which calls the python script? The issue you have is with <em>argument passing</em>, not with the windows shell, not with Python...</p>

<p>Finally, as <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/749049/passing-a-multi-line-string-as-an-argument-to-a-script-in-windows/749329#749329">mattkemp</a> said, I also suggest you use the standard input to read your multi-line argument, avoiding command line magic.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I know this thread is pretty old, but I came across it while trying to solve a similar problem, and others might as well, so let me show you how I solved it.</p>

<p>This works at least on Windows XP Pro, with Zack's code in a file called<br>
"C:\Scratch\test.py":</p>

<pre><code>C:\Scratch&gt;test.py "This is a string"^
More?
More? "It has multiple lines"^
More?
More? "There are three total"
This is a string
It has multiple lines
There are three total

C:\Scratch&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is a little more readable than Romulo's solution above.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Not sure about the Windows command-line, but would the following work?</p>

<pre><code>&gt; python myscript.py "This is a string\nIt has multiple lines\there are three total"
</code></pre>

<p>..or..</p>

<pre><code>&gt; python myscript.py "This is a string\
It has [...]\
there are [...]"
</code></pre>

<p>If not, I would suggest installing Cygwin and using a sane shell!</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Have you tried setting you multiline text as a variable and then passing the expansion of that into your script. For example:</p>

<pre><code>set Text="This is a string
It has multiple lines
there are three total"
python args.py %Text%
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, instead of reading an argument you could read from standard in.</p>

<pre><code>import sys

for line in iter(sys.stdin.readline, ''):
    print line
</code></pre>

<p>On Linux you would pipe the multiline text to the standard input of args.py.</p>

<p>$ &lt;command-that-produces-text&gt; | python args.py</p>
