<h3>Question (ID-1007481):</h3><h2>How do I replace whitespaces with underscore and vice versa?</h2><p>I want to replace whitespace with underscore in a string to create nice URLs. So that for example:</p>

<pre><code>"This should be connected" becomes "This_should_be_connected"
</code></pre>

<p>I am using Python with Django. Can this be solved using regular expressions?  </p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-9):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You don't need regular expressions, Python has a string method that does what you need:</p>

<pre><code>mystring.replace (" ", "_")
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Django has a 'slugify' function which does this, as well as other URL-friendly optimisations. It's hidden away in the defaultfilters module.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from django.template.defaultfilters import slugify
&gt;&gt;&gt; slugify("This should be connected")

this-should-be-connected
</code></pre>

<p>This isn't exactly the output you asked for, but IMO it's better for use in URLs.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Replacing spaces is fine, but I might suggest going a little further to handle other URL-hostile characters like question marks, apostrophes, exclamation points, etc.  </p>

<p>Also note that the general consensus among SEO experts is that <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=dashes%2Bunderscores%2Bseo" rel="nofollow">dashes are preferred to underscores in URLs.</a></p>

<pre><code>def urlify(s):

     # Remove all non-word characters (everything except numbers and letters)
     s = re.sub(r"\W", '', s)

     # Replace all runs of whitespace with a single dash
     s = re.sub(r"\s+", '-', s)

     return s



# Prints: I-cant-get-no-satisfaction"
print urlify("I can't get no satisfaction!")
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>use string's replace method:</p>

<p><code>"this should be connected".replace(" ", "_")</code></p>

<p><code>"this_should_be_disconnected".replace("_", " ")</code></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Using the <code>re</code> module:</p>

<pre><code>import re
re.sub('\s+', '_', "This should be connected") # This_should_be_connected
re.sub('\s+', '_', 'And     so\tshould this')  # And_so_should_this
</code></pre>

<p>Unless you have multiple spaces or other whitespace possibilities as above, you may just wish to use <code>string.replace</code> as others have suggested.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I'm using the following piece of code for my friendly urls:</p>

<pre><code>from unicodedata import normalize
from re import sub

def slugify(title):
    name = normalize('NFKD', title).encode('ascii', 'ignore').replace(' ', '-').lower()
    #remove `other` characters
    name = sub('[^a-zA-Z0-9_-]', '', name)
    #nomalize dashes
    name = sub('-+', '-', name)

    return name
</code></pre>

<p>It works fine with unicode characters as well.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Python has a built in method on strings called replace which is used as so:</p>

<pre><code>string.replace(old, new)
</code></pre>

<p>So you would use:</p>

<pre><code>string.replace(" ", "_")
</code></pre>

<p>I had this problem a while ago and I wrote code to replace characters in a string. I have to start remembering to check the python documentation because they've got built in functions for everything.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><pre><code>perl -e 'map { $on=$_; s/ /_/; rename($on, $_) or warn $!; } &lt;*&gt;;'
</code></pre>

<p>Match et replace space > underscore of all files in current directory</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><pre><code>string.replace(' ', '_'); //only replaces the first instance of ' ' with '_'. this is wrong.
string.replace(/\s/g, '_'); //this is correct, replaces all instances of ' ' with '_'.
</code></pre>
