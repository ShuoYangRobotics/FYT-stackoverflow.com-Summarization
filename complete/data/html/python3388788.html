<h3>Question (ID-3388788):</h3><h2>What's wrong with the "or" in my "if" statement?</h2><p>I've tried Google, but I can't find the answer to this simple question.
I hate myself for not being able to figure this out, but here we go.</p>

<p>How do I write an if statement with <code>or</code> in it?</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>if raw_input=="dog" or "cat" or "small bird":
    print "You can have this animal in your house"
else:
    print "I'm afraid you can't have this animal in your house."
</code></pre>

<pre><code>if raw_input() in ("dog", "cat", "small bird"):
    print "You can have this animal in your house"
else:
    print "I'm afraid you can't have this animal in your house."
</code></pre>

<p>You can also use a <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets" rel="nofollow"><code>set</code></a> here, but I doubt it would improve performance for such a small number of allowed animals</p>

<pre><code>desired_animal = raw_input()
allowed_animals = set(("dog", "cat", "small bird"))
if desired_animal in allowed_animals:
    print "You can have this animal in your house"
else:
    print "I'm afraid you can't have this animal in your house."
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>If you want to use <code>or</code>, you need to repeat the whole expression each time:</p>

<pre><code>if raw_input == "dog" or raw_input == "cat" or raw_input == "small bird":
</code></pre>

<p>But a better way to do this particular comparison is with <code>in</code>:</p>

<pre><code>if raw_input in ("dog", "cat", "small bird"):
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><pre><code>if (raw_input=="dog") or (raw_input == "cat") or (raw_input == "small bird"):
  print You can have this animal in your house
else:
  print I'm afraid you can't have this animal in your house.
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>if raw_input in ("dog", "cat", "small bird"):
  print You can have this animal in your house
else:
  print I'm afraid you can't have this animal in your house.
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><pre><code>if (raw_input=="dog") or (raw_input=="cat") or (raw_input=="small bird"):
    print You can have this animal in your house
else:
    print "I'm afraid you can't have this animal in your house."
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You can do it this way</p>

<pre><code> if raw_input=="dog" or raw_input=="cat" or raw_input=="small bird":
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><pre><code>goodanimals= ("dog" ,"cat","small bird")
print("You can have this animal in your house" if raw_input().strip().lower() in goodanimals
      else "I'm afraid you can't have this animal in your house.")
</code></pre>
