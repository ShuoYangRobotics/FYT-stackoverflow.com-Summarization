<h3>Question (ID-492716):</h3><h2>Reversing a regular expression in python</h2><p>I want to reverse a regular expression. i.e. given a regular expression, I want to produce <em>any</em> string that will match that regex.</p>

<p>I know how to do this from a theoretical computer science background using finite state machine, I just want to know if someone has already written a library to do this. :)</p>

<p>I'm using Python, so I'd like a python library.</p>

<p>To reiterate, I only want <em>one</em> string that will match the regex. Things like "." or ".*" would make an infinite amount of strings match the regex, but I don't care about all options.</p>

<p>I'm willing for this library to only work on a certain subset of regex.</p>

<p>I took everything from the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax" rel="nofollow">Regular Expression Syntax</a> up to groups -- this seems like a reasonable subset -- and I ignored some details, like line endings. Error handling, etc. is left as an exercise to the reader.</p>

<p>Of the 12 special characters in a regex, we can ignore 6 completely (2 even with the atom they apply to), 4.5 lead to a trivial replacement and 1.5 make us actually think.</p>

<p>What comes out of this is not too terribly interesting, I think.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I don't know of any module to do this. If you don't find anything like this in the Cookbook or PyPI, you could try rolling your own, using the (undocumented) re.sre_parse module. This might help getting you started:</p>

<pre><code>In [1]: import re

In [2]: a = re.sre_parse.parse("[abc]+[def]*\d?z")

In [3]: a
Out[3]: [('max_repeat', (1, 65535, [('in', [('literal', 97), ('literal', 98), ('literal', 99)])])), ('max_repeat', (0, 65535, [('in', [('literal', 100), ('literal', 101), ('literal', 102)])])), ('max_repeat', (0, 1, [('in', [('category', 'category_digit')])])), ('literal', 122)]

In [4]: eval(str(a))
Out[4]: 
[('max_repeat',
  (1, 65535, [('in', [('literal', 97), ('literal', 98), ('literal', 99)])])),
 ('max_repeat',
  (0,
   65535,
   [('in', [('literal', 100), ('literal', 101), ('literal', 102)])])),
 ('max_repeat', (0, 1, [('in', [('category', 'category_digit')])])),
 ('literal', 122)]

In [5]: a.dump()
max_repeat 1 65535
  in
    literal 97
    literal 98
    literal 99
max_repeat 0 65535
  in
    literal 100
    literal 101
    literal 102
max_repeat 0 1
  in
    category category_digit
literal 122

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Unless your regex is extremely simple (i.e. no stars or pluses), there will be infinitely many strings which match it.  If your regex only involves concatenation and alternation, then you can expand each alternation into all of its possibilities, e.g. <code>(foo|bar)(baz|quux)</code> can be expanded into the list <code>['foobaz', 'fooquux', 'barbaz', 'barquux']</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I haven't seen a Python module to do this, but I did see a (partial) implementation in Perl: <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~bowmanbs/Regexp-Genex-0.07/lib/Regexp/Genex.pm" rel="nofollow"><code>Regexp::Genex</code></a>. From the module description, it sounds like the implementation relies on internal details of Perl's regular expression engine, so it may not be useful even from a theoretical point of view (I haven't investigated the implementation, just going by the comments in the documentation).</p>

<p>I think doing what you propose in general is a hard problem and may require the use of nondeterministic programming techniques. A start would be to parse the regular expression and build a parse tree, then traverse the tree and build sample string(s) as you go. Challenging bits will probably be things like backreferences and avoiding infinite loops in your implementation.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>While the other answers use the re engine to parse out the elements I have whipped up my own that parses the re and returns a minimal pattern that would match.  (Note it doesn't handle [^ads], fancy grouping constructs, start/end of line special characters). I can supply the unit tests if you really like :)</p>

<pre><code>import re

        element = stack.pop(0) #Read from front

<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Somebody else had a similar (duplicate?) question <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4627464/generate-a-string-that-matches-a-regex-in-python">here</a>, and I'd like to offer a little helper library for <a href="https://bitbucket.org/leapfrogdevelopment/rstr/" rel="nofollow">generating random strings with Python</a> that I've been working on.</p>

<p>It includes a method, <code>xeger()</code> that allows you to create a string from a regex:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import rstr
&gt;&gt;&gt; rstr.xeger(r'[A-Z]\d[A-Z] \d[A-Z]\d')
u'M5R 2W4'
</code></pre>

<p>Right now, it works with most basic regular expressions, but I'm sure it could be improved.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Perhaps you should consider changing your string with a [::-1]
ie</p>

<p>foo = "Lampole"</p>

<p>foo = foo[::-1]</p>

<p>print foo</p>

<p>elopmaL</p>
