<h3>Question (ID-3955077):</h3><h2>Image analysis in R</h2><p>I would like to know how I would go about performing image analysis in R. My goal is to convert images into matrices (pixel-wise information), extract/quantify color, estimate the presence of shapes and compare images based on such metrics/patterns.</p>

<p>I am aware of relevant packages available in Python (suggestions relevant to Python are also welcome), but I am looking to accomplish these tasks in R.</p>

<p>Thank you for your feedback.</p>

<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Also check out the RASTER package on the R-Forge website:</p>

<p><a href="http://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/raster/" rel="nofollow">http://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/raster/</a></p>

<p>It is not released to CRAN yet but it is an excellent package to import, analyse, extract, subset images and convert them to matrices). Spatial analysis is also possible.</p>

<p>You can download the package in R via:</p>

<pre><code>install.packages("raster",repos="http://r-forge.r-project.org")
require(raster)
</code></pre>

<p>An example for R:</p>

<pre><code>#from file
r &lt;- raster(system.file("external/test.grd", package="raster"))
logo &lt;- raster(system.file("external/rlogo.grd", package="raster"), values=TRUE) 
plot(logo)
</code></pre>

<p>Check out</p>

<pre><code>?raster # and go to index of the package for an overview of all the options for image analysis.
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I'd start with <code>EBImage</code> - check out the <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/EBImage/inst/doc/EBImage-introduction.pdf" rel="nofollow">vignette</a> which demonstrates many of the tasks you mention.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You may also be interested in <a href="http://rpy.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">Rpy</a> which allows you to call R functions and use R packages from Python.  This may allow you to have your cake (Python's imaging libraries) and eat it too (R's statistical analysis capabilities).</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Try the rgdal package. You will be able to read (import) and write (export) GeoTiff image files from/to R.</p>

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I believe the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/MedicalImaging.html" rel="nofollow">CRAN Task View on Medical Imaging</a> should have something for you.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>This is a python specific library, but I have found <a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/" rel="nofollow">PIL</a> to be excellent at tasks similar to what you are trying to do.  It also has great documentation and some good examples.</p>
