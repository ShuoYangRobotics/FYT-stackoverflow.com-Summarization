<h3>Question (ID-36953):</h3><h2>Resources for lexing, tokenising and parsing in python</h2><p>Can people point me to resources on lexing, parsing and tokenising with Python?</p>

<p>I'm doing a little hacking on an open source project (<a href="http://www.hotwire-shell.org/" rel="nofollow">hotwire</a>) and wanted to do a few changes to the code that <a href="http://code.google.com/p/hotwire-shell/source/browse/trunk/hotwire/externals/shlex.py" rel="nofollow">lexes</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/hotwire-shell/source/browse/trunk/hotwire/command.py" rel="nofollow">parses and tokenises</a> the commands entered into it.  As it is real working code it is fairly complex and a bit hard to work out.</p>

<p>I haven't worked on code to lex/parse/tokenise before, so I was thinking one approach would be to work through a tutorial or two on this aspect.  I would hope to learn enough to navigate around the code I actually want to alter.  Is there anything suitable out there?  (Ideally it could be done in an afternoon without having to buy and read the dragon book first ...)</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> (7 Oct 2008) None of the below answers quite give what I want.  With them I could generate parsers from scratch, but I want to learn how to write my own basic parser from scratch, not using lex and yacc or similar tools.  Having done that I can then understand the existing code better.  </p>

<p>So could someone point me to a tutorial where I can build a basic parser from scratch, using just python?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I'm a happy user of <a href="http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/" rel="nofollow">PLY</a>. It is a pure-Python implementation of Lex &amp; Yacc, with lots of small niceties that make it quite Pythonic and easy to use. Since Lex &amp; Yacc are the most popular lexing &amp; parsing tools and are used for the most projects, PLY has the advantage of standing on giants' shoulders. A lot of knowledge exists online on Lex &amp; Yacc, and you can freely apply it to PLY.</p>

<p>PLY also has a good <a href="http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/ply.html" rel="nofollow">documentation page</a> with some simple examples to get you started. </p>

<p>For a listing of lots of Python parsing tools, see <a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/text/python-parsers.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>For medium-complex grammars, <a href="http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/" rel="nofollow">PyParsing</a> is brilliant. You can define grammars directly within Python code, no need for code generation:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from pyparsing import Word, alphas
&gt;&gt;&gt; greet = Word( alphas ) + "," + Word( alphas ) + "!" # &lt;-- grammar defined here
&gt;&gt;&gt; hello = "Hello, World!"
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; print hello, "-&gt;", greet.parseString( hello )
Hello, World! -&gt; ['Hello', ',', 'World', '!']
</code></pre>

<p>(Example taken from the PyParsing home page).</p>

<p>With parse actions (functions that are invoked when a certain grammar rule is triggered), you can convert parses directly into abstract syntax trees, or any other representation.</p>

<p>There are many helper functions that encapsulate recurring patterns, like operator hierarchies, quoted strings, nesting or C-style comments.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Here's a few things to get you started (roughly from simplest-to-most-complex, least-to-most-powerful):</p>

<p>When I learned this stuff, it was in a semester-long 400-level university course.  We did a number of assignments where we did parsing by hand; if you want to really understand what's going on under the hood, I'd recommend the same approach.</p>

<p>This isn't the book I used, but it's pretty good: <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0201000229" rel="nofollow">Principles of Compiler Design</a>.</p>

<p>Hopefully that's enough to get you started :)</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Have a look at the standard module <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-shlex.html" rel="nofollow">shlex</a> and modify one copy of it to match the syntax you use for your shell, it is a good starting point</p>

<p>If you want all the power of a complete solution for lexing/parsing, <a href="http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/Antlr3PythonTarget" rel="nofollow">ANTLR</a> can generate python too.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I suggest <a href="http://www.canonware.com/Parsing/" rel="nofollow">http://www.canonware.com/Parsing/</a>, since it is pure python and you don't need to learn a grammar, but it isn't widely used, and has comparatively little documentation. The heavyweight is ANTLR and PyParsing. ANTLR can generate java and C++ parsers too, and AST walkers but you will have to learn what amounts to a new language.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p><a href="http://pygments.org/" rel="nofollow">pygments</a> is a source code syntax highlighter written in python.  It has lexers and formatters, and may be interesting to peek at the source.</p>
