<h3>Question (ID-717541):</h3><h2>Parsing HTML in Python</h2><p>What's my best bet for parsing HTML if I can't use BeautifulSoup or lxml? I've got some code that uses SGMLlib but it's a bit low-level and it's now deprecated.</p>

<p>I would prefer if it could stomache a bit of malformed HTML although I'm pretty sure most of the input will be pretty clean.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Why can't you use BeautifulSoup? It's a simple one-file python-module, so if you don't get it "installed", just copy-and-paste it's contents into your actual script.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Perhaps <a href="http://utidylib.berlios.de/" rel="nofollow">ÂµTidylib</a> will meet your needs?</p>

<p>I don't have much experience with python, but I have used Xerces (from the Apache foundation) in the past and found it to be very useful. The learning curve isn't bad either, though I'm not coming from a python perspective. I suggest you consider it though. (The first two links I've included discuss python interfaces to Xerces and the last one is the first google hit on "python xml").</p>
