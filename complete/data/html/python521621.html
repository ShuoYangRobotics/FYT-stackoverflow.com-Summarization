<h3>Question (ID-521621):</h3><h2>What is the best way to write HTML from Python?</h2><p>I have figured out how to extract the information I need from a PDF file using PDFMiner in Python, and now I need to write out a modified version of the document with only the information that's needed as an HTML file.  The new version will be archived online to a repository, and a printed copy shipped with the unit.</p>

<p>What is the best way to write this document (a header, a logo, and a table with parameters and pass/fail limits) from Python?</p>

<p>HTMLGen?</p>

<p>Or is there a better, newer Python package?  </p>

<p>I can write my own package to write HTML, but surely someone else has done this already.</p>

I bet if you looked around you could find hundreds of possibilities. Dynamic websites are a Very Big Thing these days and they all need some sort of templating system, so plenty have been developed. Try a Google search for something like "Python templating" to find more. (First hit: <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/Templating" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.python.org/moin/Templating</a>)</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>In the past I've had a lot of luck with SimpleTAL (a stand-alone version of zope's Page Template Library)</p>

<p>Today, I'd use Django's templates (which can be used stand-alone) because I <em>love</em> some of the markups like {% ifchanged %} {% nospace %} {% firstof %} etc...</p>

<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>If the HTML you want to generate is exceedingly dynamic you might not be able to write an elegant template for it, so things like HTMLGen or <a href="http://pyhtmloo.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">pyhtmloo</a> could be the way to go.</p>
