<h3>Question (ID-2115098):</h3><h2>Simpler framework than Django?</h2><p>Django installation itself was quite a task (for a beginner like me) and reading a book to learn it would not be possible right now. I'm just looking to create simple test applications only to learn Python better, so I'm not ready for Django yet.</p>

<p>Is there any simple web framework that can be used for test projects, so I don't have to spend most of the time in project setup and configuration? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p><a href="http://pylonshq.com/" rel="nofollow">Pylons</a> is pretty easy to set up - there's a command that generates the skeleton code for your application and you can write your code with no configuration other than the port number you want it to listen on.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.cherrypy.org/" rel="nofollow">cherrypy</a> is another more lightweight solution. It's just the web server part of the equation, and lets you handle templating/database (if any) as you prefer.</p>

<p>Here's the minimal application, from the <a href="http://www.cherrypy.org/wiki/CherryPyTutorial" rel="nofollow">tutorial</a>:</p>

<pre><code>import cherrypy

class HelloWorld:
    def index(self):
        return "Hello world!"
    index.exposed = True

cherrypy.quickstart(HelloWorld())
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I started with <a href="http://www.web2py.com" rel="nofollow">web2py</a> and found it both easy and powerful.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Try <a href="http://webpy.org/" rel="nofollow">web.py</a> or <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/cgi.html" rel="nofollow">Python's cgi</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I've used Django.  Project setup and configuration shouldn't take that long compared to writing the project code.  I think it would probably be fastest to use Django.  The next-best alternative would be to use SimpleHTTPServer, which is in the Python library.  You have to do a lot of work yourself, such as generating 404s and response headers, and you have to manage database connections yourself, but it is simpler.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I would definitely recommend <a href="http://dev.pocoo.org/projects/werkzeug/" rel="nofollow">werkzeug</a>. It is really dead simple and will expose you to WSGI which is also used by several framework like django and <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/" rel="nofollow">Google App Engine</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>you could also try <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/webapp/" rel="nofollow">google app engines webapp framework</a> if you want something to create toy webapps that deploy really easily (and cheaply !)</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>I think you don't need to read a complete book on django. It's also very common to start with the excellent <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/" rel="nofollow">django tutorial</a>. After that you can play a bit with your code and still have one of the greatest documentions that is available for any opensource framework at your hand.</p>

<p>I learned django only through the docs at the time I was starting. It is very understandable and does not require a deep understanding of python.</p>
