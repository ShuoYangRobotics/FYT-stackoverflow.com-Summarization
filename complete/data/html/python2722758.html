<p>Armin, the author of Flask, also wrote Werkzeug, which I use a lot, and find very well written.  Here is the source:</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You can't read too much source. I think a good idea would be to take some Pythonistas (Raymond Hettinger and Ian Bicking come to mind) and fish out their code from their projects or from other sources like ActiveState and go through them.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I vote for <a href="http://djangoproject.com" rel="nofollow">Django</a>, maybe too much specific on web developing field.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>the Python STDLIB</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I think that the <a href="http://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py" rel="nofollow">Python interface for Redis</a> written by <a href="http://github.com/andymccurdy" rel="nofollow">Andy McCurdy</a> is a superb example of how Python code should be written, packaged, and organized.  Have a look at the source code for yourself!</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>The <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/browser" rel="nofollow">Twisted code</a> is pretty well-written, although it is a somewhat complex codebase.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I know <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jaikuengine/" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/jaikuengine/</a> was ported to Google App engine by googlers, so there must be some good practices in there.  </p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Consider the stdlib, some modules more so than others. One project that I have found exemplifies good python coding practices is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/rietveld" rel="nofollow">rietveld</a>. Of course, good in one person's eyes is awful in another's.</p>
