<h3>Question (ID-1070525):</h3><h2>Python + CGI script cannot access environment variables</h2><p>I'm coding a webservice on python that uses an Oracle database. I have cx_Oracle installed and working but I'm having some problems when I run my python code as CGI using Apache.</p>

<p>For example the following code works perfectly at the command line:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python 
import os 
import cx_Oracle 
import defs as df 

os.putenv('ORACLE_HOME', '/oracledb/10.2.0/') 
os.putenv('LD_LIBRARY_PATH', '/oracledb/10.2.0/lib') 

con = cx_Oracle.Connection(df.DB_USER, df.DB_PASS, df.DB_SID) 
print con
</code></pre>

<p>But when I run it as CGI I get a "cx_Oracle.InterfaceError: Unable to acquire Oracle environment handle" at the apache error log.</p>

<p>I searched the Net and everybody says that I have to set the <code>ORACLE_HOME</code> and <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> environment variables. Somehow the CGI script cannot access this environment variables even when I define them using <code>os.putenv</code> as you can see at the code.</p>

<p>What I'm I doing wrong? Thanks!</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-9):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You need this:</p>

<pre><code>os.environ['ORACLE_HOME'] = '/oracledb/10.2.0/'
os.environ['LD_LIBRARY_PATH'] = '/oracledb/10.2.0/lib'
</code></pre>

<p>instead of using <code>os.putenv()</code> because <code>os.putenv()</code> doesn't update <code>os.environ</code>, which <code>cx_Oracle</code> is presumably looking at.</p>

<p>Documentation: <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/os.html" rel="nofollow">Miscellaneous operating system interfaces</a> says: <em>"Note: Calling putenv() directly does not change os.environ, so itâ€™s better to modify os.environ."</em></p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You can eliminate the problem altogether if you eliminate the need to set the environment variables.  Here's a note on how to do this by installing the Oracle Instant Client on your box.</p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>From just a short <a href="http://osdir.com/ml/python.db.cx-oracle/2006-01/msg00007.html" rel="nofollow">google</a> on the problem, it could be that your problem is related to the the ending <code>/</code> in <code>ORACLE_HOME</code>.<br />
Try removing it (and using also suggestion from Richie) and see if it works.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You could use a shell script to implement the CGI, set the environment variables in the shell script and call the python script from the shell script.</p>

<p>Setting environment variables from within python seems  to be a tricky thing, especially when you are dealing with how libraries are loaded...</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I've managed to solve the problem.</p>

<p>Somehow the user and group that apache was using didn't have access to the environment variables. I solved the problem by changing the user and group that apache was using to a user that I was certain to have access to this variables. </p>

<p>It's strange (and frustrating) that it's so difficult to set this variables using Python.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone that answered my question!</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Are your statements out of order?</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python 
import os 
os.putenv('ORACLE_HOME', '/oracledb/10.2.0/') 
os.putenv('LD_LIBRARY_PATH', '/oracledb/10.2.0/lib') 

import cx_Oracle 
import defs as df 

con = cx_Oracle.Connection(df.DB_USER, df.DB_PASS, df.DB_SID) 
print con
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>This is working for me:</p>

<pre><code>os.putenv('ORACLE_HOME', '/oracle/client/v10.2.0.3-64bit')
os.putenv('LD_LIBRARY_PATH', '/oracle/client/v10.2.0.3-64bit/lib')
os.environ['ORACLE_HOME'] = '/oracle/client/v10.2.0.3-64bit'
os.environ['LD_LIBRARY_PATH'] = '/oracle/client/v10.2.0.3-64bit/lib'
</code></pre>

<p>Mind that first putenv, then update environ.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>The actual question why the questioner's code did not work has not yet been answered.</p>

<p>The answer is that the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH is only evaluated when an application is started (in this case the Python interpreter). When Python has started, it is already too late to mess with this variable; and it doesn't matter at all whether you set it using os.environ or os.putenv (but generally the former should be used).</p>

<p>The solution is to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable in a wrapper script that starts the Python script, or to start Apache with that environment variable already set. On OpenSUSE, you can do the latter by setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH in /etc/sysconfig/apache2, for instance.</p>

<p>By the way, the same problem exists when using mod_wsgi instead of a CGI script. See the section "Unable To Find Python Shared Library" on the mod_wsgi <a href="http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/InstallationIssues" rel="nofollow">Installation Issues</a> page.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>Don't forget adding <strong>env</strong> module for apache:</p>

<pre><code>a2enmod env
</code></pre>

<p>in .htaccess or apache configuration:</p>

<pre><code>SetEnv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /oracle_lib_path
</code></pre>

<p>in /etc/apache2/envvars doesn't work</p>
