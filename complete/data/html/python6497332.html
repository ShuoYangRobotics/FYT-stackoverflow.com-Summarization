<h3>Question (ID-6497332):</h3><h2>Running a Python Subprocess</h2><p>All,</p>

<p>I have read several threads on how to run subprocesses in python and none of them seem to help me. It's probably because I don't know how to use them properly. I have several methods that I would like to run at the same time rather than in sequence and I thought that the subprocess module would do this for me.</p>

<pre><code>def services():
     services = [method1(),
            method2(),
            method3(),  
            mrthod4(),
            method5()]
     return services

def runAll():
    import subprocess
    for i in services():
        proc = subprocess.call(i,shell=True)
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with this approach is that method1() starts and method2() doesn't start until 1 finishes. I have tried several approaches including using subprocess.Popen[] in my services method with no luck. Can anyone lend me a hand on how to get methods 1-5 running at the same time?</p>

<p>Thanks,
Adam</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>According to the Python documentation <code>subprocess.call()</code> waits for the command to complete. You should directly use the <code>subprocess.Popen</code> objects which will give you the flexibility you need.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You need to use &amp; to execute them asynchronously.  Here is an example:</p>

<pre><code> subprocess.call("./foo1&amp;", shell=True)
 subprocess.call("./foo2&amp;", shell=True)
</code></pre>

<p>This is just like the ordinary unix shell.</p>

<p>EDIT:  Though there are multiple, much better ways to do this.  See the other answers for some examples.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Python threads are more appropriate to what you are looking for: <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/threading.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/library/threading.html</a> or even the multiprocessing module: <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html#module-multiprocessing" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html#module-multiprocessing</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>In python 3.2.x the concurrent futures module makes this sort of things very easy.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>subprocess does not make the processes asynchronous. What you are trying to achieve can be done using multithreading or multiprocessing module.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>By saying <code>method1()</code>, you're calling the function and waiting for it to return. (It's a function, not a method.)</p>

<p>If you just want to run a bunch of heavy-duty function in parallel and collect their result, you can use <a href="http://packages.python.org/joblib/" rel="nofollow"><code>joblib</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>from joblib import Parallel, delayed

functions = [fn1, fn2, fn3, fn4]

results = Parallel(n_jobs=4)(delayed(f)() for f in functions)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p><code>subprocess.call()</code> blocks until the process completes.</p>

<p><code>multiprocessing</code> sounds more appropriate for what you are doing.</p>

<p>for example:</p>

<pre><code>from multiprocessing import Process

def f1():
    while True:
        print 'foo'

def f2():
    while True:
        print 'bar'

def f3():
    while True:
        print 'baz'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for func in (f1, f2, f3):
        Process(target=func).start()
</code></pre>
