<h3>Question (ID-686780):</h3><h2>Best resources for starting Jython</h2><p>I just got my first Jython (and Python) project, and I was wondering what documentation, IDEs, etc. are best suited to a Java buff like me. </p>

<p>I know there are a lot of questions about starting out with Python, so I'm asking for things that might be specific to Jython. Where should I start? If it helps, I'm running Linux and Solaris only.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>For starters, I'd read <a href="http://dirtsimple.org/2004/12/python-is-not-java.html" rel="nofollow">python is not java</a>.  It'll give you a good idea of some habits you may have to break to program in Python effectively.  As has been mentioned, pydev is a pretty good development environment.  Although I would say that you would eventually want to learn emacs (but you may just want to learn one thing at a time).</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Do you use Eclipse for Java? <a href="http://pydev.org/" rel="nofollow">PyDev</a> is a nice Eclipse plugin for Python.  PyDev has full support for Jython.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If you're using Netbeans for Java there's a nice <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/features/python/" rel="nofollow">Python plugin</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I'm surprised no one has yet mentioned <a href="http://www.jython.org/Project/" rel="nofollow">www.jython.org</a> -- maybe that's too obvious.  I also liked the book <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0596002475" rel="nofollow">Jython Essentials</a> from O'Reilly.  The book is dated (from 2002), but I still keep it on my bookshelf.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>The Jython-users mailing list is a great resource:<br>
<a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/jython-users" rel="nofollow">https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/jython-users</a><br>
jython-users@lists.sourceforge.net</p>

<p>IBM Developerworks has some good articles, which I can't find on their website anymore. They are on the jython.org homepage however:<br>
<a href="http://www.jython.org/j-jython1-ltr.pdf" rel="nofollow">Part 1</a><br>
<a href="http://www.jython.org/j-jython2-ltr.pdf" rel="nofollow">Part 2</a><br></p>

<p>PyDev is a good IDE if you're into Eclipse</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Book: The Definitive Guide to Jython, for jython 2.5.</p>
