<h3>Question (ID-1191136):</h3><h2>Hosting Mercurial with IIS 6</h2><p>I'm trying to set up Mercurial repositories to be hosted by IIS under Windows Server 2003. Following <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/818571/how-to-setup-mercurial-and-hgwebdir-on-iis">this post</a> I installed Python 2.5.4.4 and Mercurial 1.3, set up virtual dir, extracted library.zip and created hgwebdir.config.</p>

<p>However, when I trying to open the <a href="http://hostname/hg/hgwebdir.cgi" rel="nofollow">http://hostname/hg/hgwebdir.cgi</a> I got an error “The specified CGI application misbehaved by not returning a complete set of HTTP headers.” I did all by best:</p>

<ol>
<li>Checked IIS mappings to both .py and .cgi extensions. I even tried to use FastCGI with no success.</li>
<li>Created “Hello World” in the same dir and checked that it works fine.</li>
<li>Checked read/exec permissions to Python, IIS and repos directories for IUSR, IWAM and NETWORK SERVICE.</li>
<li>Tried to apply two different patches from <a href="http://www.nabble.com/Mercurial-f24354.html" rel="nofollow">Mercurial mailing list</a>. Since they both are old I haven't success with it.</li>
<li>INstalled Sysinternals' procmon and checked for filesystem errors during request. I found nothing except lots of Buffer Overflow results in Python process while it loads it's libraries.</li>
<li>Tried to add 'Content-type: text/html' to the script.</li>
</ol>

<p>One more thing is when I'm requesting inexistent script file (e.g /hg/inexist.cgi) I have the same error. Nothing helped!</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Some more things that I needed to fix:</p>

<ul>
<li>Where the various HOWTOs say to use <code>c:\whatever\Python26\python.exe -u "%s" "%s"</code> instead use <code>c:\whatever\Python26\python.exe -u -O -B "%s" "%s"</code>  -O causes it to also look for .pyo files (not just .py or .pyc, which at least in my version weren't present).  -B causes it to not attempt to compile .py files that it finds into .pyo files (which fails due to lacking write permissions)</li>
<li>I'd installed Python 2.7.  Mercurial 1.6.2's .pyo files were compiled with Python 2.6.  This resulted in a magic number error.  Uninstalling 2.7 and installing 2.6.5 fixed this.  (If you're reading this at some point in the future, this point may no longer be relevant - check the name of the DLL in Mercurial's directory, or TortoiseHg's directory, depending on where you took library.zip from)</li>
<li>hgwebdir.cgi is now just hgweb.cgi - webdir was integrated into it</li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Finally I got that "no headers" error returned on any python script error, so I checked script with console interpreter and fixed errors in my config file. And of course I should ask this question at ServerFault instead of StackOverflow - the lack of sleep did the job :) </p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>In my situation, this error caused by line <code>application = hgwebdir('c:\somewhere\hgweb.config')</code> in hgweb.cgi, it should be <code>application = hgweb('c:\somewhere\hgweb.config')</code>.  </p>

<p>Besides, uncomment line <code>import cgitb; cgitb.enable()</code> in hgweb.cgi will give you more info about the error( and other errors).</p>

<p>P.S. I use Python 2.6.6 and Mercurial 1.7.3 on Windows Server 2003 with IIS 6.0.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>In my case, the critical step that fixed it was using: c:\whatever\Python26\python.exe -u -O -B "%s" "%s</p>

<p>Before that it was not working with the error: </p>

<pre><code>A problem occurred in a Python script. Here is the sequence of function calls leading up to the error, in the order they occurred.

 c:\hg\hgweb.cgi in ()
   13 import cgitb; cgitb.enable()
   14 
   15 from mercurial import demandimport; demandimport.enable()
   16 from mercurial.hgweb import hgweb, wsgicgi
   17 application = hgweb(config)
mercurial undefined, demandimport undefined
&lt;type 'exceptions.ImportError'&gt;: No module named mercurial 
      args = ('No module named mercurial',) 
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>There's a pretty good post at <a href="http://vampirebasic.blogspot.com/2009/06/running-mercurial-on-windows.html" rel="nofollow">http://vampirebasic.blogspot.com/2009/06/running-mercurial-on-windows.html</a> that'll get you started, but if you need more detail or to go further than the writer did, I've got a 4 part blog post that covers everything you need to know about getting up and running on IIS, including Active Directory integration, pull/push privileges, customization of the UI:</p>

<p>It's worth a read...</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I have just finished setting up Mercurial on IIS6, and suggest going down the ISAPI route, not CGI.   I found CGI very unstable.<br>
He a look at my blog entry : <a href="http://hyperionchaos.net/blog" rel="nofollow">http://hyperionchaos.net/blog</a> , and see if it helps.</p>
