<h3>Question (ID-306313):</h3><h2>Python "is" operator behaves unexpectedly with integers</h2><p>Why does the following behave unexpectedly in Python?</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 256
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = 256
&gt;&gt;&gt; a is b
True           # this is an expected result
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 257
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = 257
&gt;&gt;&gt; a is b
False          # what happened here? why is this False?
&gt;&gt;&gt; 257 is 257
True           # yet the literal numbers compare properly
</code></pre>

<p>I am using Python 2.5.2. Trying some different versions of Python, it appears that a Python 2.3.3 shows the above behaviour between 99 and 100.</p>

<p>Based on the above, I can hypothesise that Python is internally implemented such that "small" integers are stored in a different way than larger integers, and the <code>is</code> operator can tell the difference. Why the leaky abstraction? What is a better way of comparing two arbitrary objects to see whether they are the same, and I don't know in advance whether they are numbers or not?</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 256
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = 256
&gt;&gt;&gt; id(a)
9987148
&gt;&gt;&gt; id(b)
9987148
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 257
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = 257
&gt;&gt;&gt; id(a)

<p>EDIT: Here's what I found in the Python documentation, <a href="http://docs.python.org/c-api/int.html" rel="nofollow">7.2.1, "Plain Integer Objects"</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The current implementation keeps an
  array of integer objects for all
  integers between -5 and 256, when you
  create an int in that range you
  actually just get back a reference to
  the existing object. So it should be
  possible to change the value of 1. I
  suspect the behaviour of Python in
  this case is undefined. :-)</p>
</blockquote>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>It depends on whether you're looking to see if 2 things are equal, or the same object. </p>

<p>"is" checks to see if they are the same object, not just equal. The small ints are probably pointing to the same memory location for space efficiency </p>

<pre><code>In [29]: a = 3
In [30]: b = 3
In [31]: id(a)
Out[31]: 500729144
In [32]: id(b)
Out[32]: 500729144
</code></pre>

<p>You should use "==" to compare equality of arbitrary objects. You can specify the behavior with the <code>__eq__</code>, and <code>__ne__</code> attributes.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>As you can check <a href="http://svn.python.org/projects/python/trunk/Objects/intobject.c" rel="nofollow">here</a> Python caches small ints for eficiency. Everytime you create a reference to a small int, you are referring the cached small int, not a new object. 257 is not an small int, so it is calculated as a different object.</p>

<p>It is better to use "==" for that purpose.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I think your hypotheses is correct. Experiment with id (identity of object)..</p>

<pre><code>In [1]: id(255)
Out[1]: 146349024

In [2]: id(255)
Out[2]: 146349024

In [3]: id(257)
Out[3]: 146802752

In [4]: id(257)
Out[4]: 148993740

In [5]: a=255

In [6]: b=255

In [7]: c=257

In [8]: d=257

In [9]: id(a), id(b), id(c), id(d)
Out[9]: (146349024, 146349024, 146783024, 146804020)
</code></pre>

<p>It appears that numbers &lt;= 255 are treated as literals and anything above is treated differently!</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>The 'is' operator is not another way to type '=='.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>For immutable value objects, like ints, strings or datetimes, object identity is not especially useful. It's better to think about equality. Identity is essentially an implementation detail for value objects - since they're immutable, there's no effective difference between having multiple refs to the same object or multiple objects.</p>
