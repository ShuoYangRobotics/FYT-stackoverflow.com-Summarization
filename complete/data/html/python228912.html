<h3>Question (ID-228912):</h3><h2>SQLite parameter substitution problem</h2><p>Using SQLite3 with Python 2.5, I'm trying to iterate through a list and pull the weight of an item from the database based on the item's name.</p>

<p>I tried using the "?" parameter substitution suggested to prevent SQL injections but it doesn't work. For example, when I use:</p>

<pre><code>for item in self.inventory_names:
    self.cursor.execute("SELECT weight FROM Equipment WHERE name = ?", item)
    self.cursor.close()
</code></pre>

<p>I get the error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>sqlite3.ProgrammingError: Incorrect number of bindings supplied. The current statement uses 1, and there are 8 supplied.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe this is somehow caused by the initial creation of the database; the module I made that actually creates the DB does have 8 bindings.</p>

<pre><code>cursor.execute("""CREATE TABLE Equipment 
    (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, 
    name TEXT,
    price INTEGER, 
    weight REAL, 
    info TEXT, 
    ammo_cap INTEGER, 
    availability_west TEXT,
    availability_east TEXT)""")
</code></pre>

<p>However, when I use the less-secure "%s" substitution for each item name, it works just fine. Like so:</p>

<pre><code>for item in self.inventory_names:
    self.cursor.execute("SELECT weight FROM Equipment WHERE name = '%s'" % item)
    self.cursor.close()
</code></pre>

<p>I can't figure out why it thinks I have 8 bindins when I'm only calling one. How can I fix it?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The <code>Cursor.execute()</code> method expects a sequence as second parameter. You are supplying a string which happens to be 8 characters long.</p>

<p>Use the following form instead:</p>

<pre><code>self.cursor.execute("SELECT weight FROM Equipment WHERE name = ?", [item])
</code></pre>

<p>Python library reference 13.13.3: sqlite3 <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/lib/sqlite3-Cursor-Objects.html" rel="nofollow">Cursor Objects</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I have spent half a day trying to figure out why something like this would give me an error:</p>

<pre><code>cursor.execute("SELECT * from ? WHERE name = ?", (table_name, name))
</code></pre>

<p>only to find out that table names <em>cannot be parametrized</em>. Hope this will help other people save some time.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>have You tried this ? :</p>

<pre><code>for item in self.inventory_names:
    t = (item,)
    self.cursor.execute("SELECT weight FROM Equipment WHERE name = ?", t)
    self.cursor.close()
</code></pre>

<p>cursor.execute() expects a sequence (list,tuple) as second parameter. (-> ddaa )</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The argument of <code>cursor.execute</code> that represents the values you need inserted in the database should be a tuple (sequence). However consider this example and see what's happening:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; ('jason')
'jason'

&gt;&gt;&gt; ('jason',)
('jason',)
</code></pre>

<p>The first example evaluates to a string instead; so the correct way of representing single valued tuple is as in the second evaluation. Anyhow, the code below to fix your error.</p>

<pre><code>self.cursor.execute("SELECT weight FROM Equipment WHERE name = ?", (item,))
</code></pre>

<p>Also giving the <code>cursor.execute</code> value arguments as strings,(which is what you are doing) results in the first evaluation in the example and results into the error you are getting.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Quoting (is that what the parens mean?) the ? with parens seems to work for me. I kept trying with (literally) '?' but I kept getting</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ProgrammingError: Incorrect number of bindings supplied. The current statement uses 0, and there are 1 supplied.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I did:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SELECT fact FROM factoids WHERE key LIKE (?)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>instead of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SELECT fact FROM factoids WHERE key LIKE '?'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It worked.</p>

<p>Is this some python 2.6 thing?</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Try</p>

<pre><code>execute("select fact from factoids where key like ?", "%%s%" % val)
</code></pre>

<p>You don't wrap anything around the <code>?</code> at all, Python sqlite will correctly convert it into a quoted entity.</p>
