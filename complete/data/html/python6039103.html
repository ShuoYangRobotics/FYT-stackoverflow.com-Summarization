<h3>Question (ID-6039103):</h3><h2>Counting "deepness" or the deepest level a nested list goes to</h2><p>A have a real problem (and a headache) with an assigment...</p>

<p>I'm in an introductory programming class, and I have to write a function that, given a list, will return the "maximum" deepness it goes to...
For example: [1,2,3] will return 1,  [1,[2,3]] will return 2...</p>

<p>I've written this piece of code (it's the best I could get T_T)</p>

<pre><code>def flat(l):
    count=0
    for item in l:
        if isinstance(item,list):
            count+= flat(item)
    return count+1
</code></pre>

<p>However, It obviously doens't work like it should, because if there are lists that do not count for the maximum deepness, it still raises the counter...</p>

<p>For example: when I use the function with [1,2,[3,4],5,[6],7] it should return 2, but it returns 3...</p>

<p>Any ideas or help would be greatly appreciated ^^ thanks a lot!! I've been strugling with this for weeks now...</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Here is one way to write the function</p>

<pre><code>depth = lambda L: isinstance(L, list) and max(map(depth, L))+1
</code></pre>

<p>I think the idea you are missing is to use <code>max()</code></p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>easy with recursion</p>

<pre><code>def flat(l):
    depths = []
    for item in l:
        if isinstance(item, list):
            depths.append(flat(item))
    if len(depths) &gt; 0:
        return 1 + max(depths)
    return 1
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Let's first rephrase your requirements slightly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The depth of a list is one more than the maximum depth of its sub-lists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, this can be translated directly to code:</p>

<pre><code>def depth(l):
    if isinstance(l, list):
        return 1 + max(depth(item) for item in l)
    else:
        return 0
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Abusive way:
Say your list is called <code>mylist</code><br>
<code>mybrackets = map(lambda x: 1 if x=='[' else -1, [x for x in str(mylist) if x=='[' or x==']'])<br>
maxdepth = max([sum(mybrackets[:i+1]) for i in range(len(mybrackets))])</code>  </p>

<p>This converts your list to a list of opening and closing brackets, then finds the largest number of opening brackets that occur before the corresponding closing bracket occurs.</p>

<p>enjoy</p>

<pre><code>def f(g,count=0): return count if not isinstance(g,list) else max([f(x,count+1) for x in g])
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Breadth-first, without recursion, and it also works with other sequence types:</p>

<pre><code>from collections import Sequence
from itertools import chain, count

def depth(seq):
    for level in count():
        if not seq:
            return level
        seq = list(chain.from_iterable(s for s in seq if isinstance(s, Sequence)))
</code></pre>

<p>The same idea, but with much less memory consumption:</p>

<pre><code>from collections import Sequence
from itertools import chain, count

def depth(seq):
    seq = iter(seq)
    try:
        for level in count():
            seq = chain([next(seq)], seq)
            seq = chain.from_iterable(s for s in seq if isinstance(s, Sequence))
    except StopIteration:
        return level
</code></pre>
