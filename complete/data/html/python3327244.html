<h3>Question (ID-3327244):</h3><h2>Facebook wall writing application</h2><p>I was wondering if i could possible write an app, that could be a list of all my friends and just simply posting a message to their walls on the friends i select. Not a message, a wall post. So it appears that i went to their wall and wrote a message, they have no idea that an app is pushing the message to them.</p>

<p>also could it be written in python :) its what i know. php is so icky, but doable if it is the only option.</p>

<p>Please and thank you.</p>

<p>In particular, you want the <code>put_wall_post</code> function.</p>

<p>A short python script making use of this module should fit your needs perfectly.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Check out the Facebook API. It will more than likely show that the wall post came from your application. As far as the language you implement in, I think you could use Python.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>There are a couple of Facebook APIs that could tie in to. I'm at work and any website that makes mention of facebook is blocked so I can't provide links, but Google 'Facebook API'.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Yes, it is possible. The <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/" rel="nofollow">facebook api</a> supports Python via <a href="http://github.com/facebook/python-sdk" rel="nofollow">python-sdk</a>. You would be interested in <code>stream.publish</code> (<a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/rest/stream.publish" rel="nofollow">link</a>)</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Sure, you could do this. You'll need to have a look at the <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/" rel="nofollow">docs</a>.
You can use the <a href="http://github.com/facebook/python-sdk/" rel="nofollow">Python SDK</a> to work in Python, and the <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/api" rel="nofollow">Graph API</a> to make the posts.  Have fun</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Here is below code to achieve your requirement in facebook application: (Your application should be already contain publish to wall permission. That you can find at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2690723/facebook-graph-api-and-django/5539531#5539531">Start up Application</a>)</p>

<pre><code>update_url = "https://graph.facebook.com/&lt;Your_Friend_Facebook_ID&gt;/feed"

for k, v in form_fields.iteritems():
  temp[k] = unicode(v).encode('utf-8')

form_data = urllib.urlencode(temp)
