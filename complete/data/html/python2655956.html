<h3>Question (ID-2655956):</h3><h2>filtering elements from list of lists in Python?</h2><p>I want to filter elements from a list of lists, and iterate over the elements of each element using a lambda.  For example, given the list:</p>

<pre><code>a = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
</code></pre>

<p>suppose that I want to keep only elements where the sum of the list is greater than N. I tried writing:</p>

<pre><code>filter(lambda x, y, z: x + y + z &gt;= N, a)
</code></pre>

<p>but I get the error:</p>

<pre><code> &lt;lambda&gt;() takes exactly 3 arguments (1 given)
</code></pre>

<p>How can I iterate while assigning values of each element to x, y, and z? Something like zip, but for arbitrarily long lists.</p>

<p>thanks,</p>

<p>p.s. I know I can write this using: filter(lambda x: sum(x)..., a) but that's not the point, imagine that these were not numbers but arbitrary elements and I wanted to assign their values to variable names.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Using <code>lambda</code> with <code>filter</code> is sort of silly when we have other techniques available.</p>

<p>In this case I would probably solve the specific problem this way (or using the equivalent generator expression)</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
&gt;&gt;&gt; [item for item in a if sum(item) &gt; 10]
[[4, 5, 6]]
</code></pre>

<p>or, if I needed to unpack, like</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; [(x, y, z) for x, y, z in a if (x + y) ** z &gt; 30]
[(4, 5, 6)]
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>If I really needed a function, I could use argument tuple unpacking (which is removed in Python 3.x, by the way, since people don't use it much): <code>lambda (x, y, z): x + y + z</code> takes a tuple and unpacks its three items as <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code>. (Note that you can also use this in <code>def</code>, i.e.: <code>def f((x, y, z)): return x + y + z</code>.) </p>

<p>You can, of course, use assignment style unpacking (<code>def f(item): x, y, z = item; return x + y + z</code>) and indexing (<code>lambda item: item[0] + item[1] + item[2]</code>) in all versions of Python.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You can explicitly name the sublist elements (assuming there's always a fixed number of them), by giving lambda a tuple as its argument:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
&gt;&gt;&gt; N = 10
&gt;&gt;&gt; filter(lambda (i, j, k): i + j + k &gt; N, a)
[[4, 5, 6]]
</code></pre>

<p>If you specify "lambda i, j, k" as you tried to do, you're saying lambda will receive three arguments. But filter will give lambda each element of a, that is, <em>one</em> sublist at a time (thus the error you got). By enclosing the arguments to lambda in parenthesis, you're saying that lambda will receive one argument, but you're also naming each of its components. </p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You can do something like</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a=[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
&gt;&gt;&gt; filter(lambda (x,y,z),: x+y+z&gt;6, a)
[[4, 5, 6]]
</code></pre>

<p>Using the deconstruction syntax.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Try something like this:</p>

<pre><code>filter(lambda a: a[0] + a[1] + a[2] &gt;= N, a)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Use a function instead of a lambda, then <code>myVar = a[0]</code>, etc.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>How about this?</p>

<p><code>
filter(lambda b : reduce(lambda x, y : x + y, b) &gt;= N, a)
</code></p>

<p>This isn't answering the question asked, I know, but it works for arbitrarily-long lists, and arbitrarily-long sublists, and supports any operation that works under <code>reduce()</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Ok, obviously you know that you can use <code>sum</code>.  The goal of what you are trying to do seems a bit vague, but I think that the optional parameter syntax might help you out, or at least give you some inspiration. If you place a <code>*</code> before a parameter, it creates a tuple of all of itself and all of the remaining parameters. If you place a <code>**</code> before it, you get a dictionary.</p>

<p>To see this:</p>

<pre><code>def print_test(a,b,c,*d):
    print a
    print b
    print c
    print d

print_test(1,2,3,4,5,6)
</code></pre>

<p>prints</p>

<pre><code>1
2
3
(4, 5, 6)
</code></pre>

<p>You can use this syntax with <code>lambda</code> too.</p>

<p>Like I said, I'm not sure exactly what you are trying to do, but it sounds like this might help. I don't think you can get local variable assignments in <code>lambda</code> without some hacking, but maybe you can use this to assign the values to variables somehow.</p>

<p>Edit: Ah, I understand what you are looking for moreso now. I think you want:</p>

<pre><code>lambda (a, b, c): a+b+c &gt; N
</code></pre>
