<h3>Question (ID-3200001):</h3><h2>Using crontab with django</h2><p>I need to create a function for sending newsletters everyday from crontab. I've found two ways of doing this on the internet :</p>

<p>First - file placed in the django project folder:</p>

<pre><code>#! /usr/bin/env python
import sys
import os

from django.core.management import setup_environ
import settings
setup_environ(settings)

from django.core.mail import send_mail
from project.newsletter.models import Newsletter, Address

def main(argv=None):
    if argv is None:
        argv = sys.argv

    newsletters = Newsletter.objects.filter(sent=False)
    message = 'Your newsletter.'

    adr = Address.objects.all()
    for a in adr:
        for n in newsletters:
            send_mail('System report',message, a ,['user@example.com'])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure if it will work and I'm not sure how to run it. Let's say it's called run.py, so should I call it in cron with <code>0 0 * * * python /path/to/project/run.py
</code> ?</p>

<p>Second solution - create my send function anywhere (just like a normal django function), and then create a run.py script :</p>

<pre><code>import sys
import os

os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'settings'

module_name = sys.argv[1]
function_name = ' '.join(sys.argv[2:])

exec('import %s' % module_name)
exec('%s.%s' % (module_name, function_name))
</code></pre>

<p>And then in cron call : <code>0 0 * * * python /path/to/project/run.py newsletter.views daily_job()</code></p>

<p>Which method will work, or which is better ?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>i would suggest creating your functionality as <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/custom-management-commands/">django-management-command</a> and run it via crontab</p>

<p>if your command is <code>send_newsletter</code> then simply</p>

<pre><code>0 0 * * * python /path/to/project/manage.py send_newsletter
</code></pre>

<p>and you don't need to take care of setting the settings module in this case/</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I'd recommend option 3: use the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-command-extensions/wiki/JobsScheduling" rel="nofollow">jobs system</a> in <a href="http://github.com/django-extensions/django-extensions" rel="nofollow">django-extensions</a>.  The relevant extension commands are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>create_jobs</code> – Creates a Django jobs command directory structure for the given app name in the current directory. This is part of the impressive jobs system.</li>
<li><code>runjob</code> – run a single maintenance job. Part of the jobs system.</li>
<li><code>runjobs</code> – runs scheduled maintenance jobs. Specify hourly, daily, weekly, monthly. Part of the jobs system.</li>
</ul>

<p>This lets you manage all the job handling inside of Django, so you don't have to keep messing with the crontab.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I have written a few command-line applications using a method similar to your first option. I prefer to do it this way as opposed to using the <code>DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE</code> environment variable because it feels more like a regular Python program (to me).</p>

<p>You should also note that you do not have to put your module in the same directory as your <code>settings.py</code>; you can use the absolute Python path of your settings module:</p>

<pre><code>from django.core.management import setup_environ
from project import settings
setup_environ(settings)
#The rest of your imports
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow">PEP 8</a> discourages relative imports anyway.</p>

<p>I always install my Django applications in site-packages (<code>/usr/lib64/python2.6/site-packages</code> on Gentoo) so I don't have to worry about setting <code>PYTHONPATH</code> from my crontabs, but I don't believe that is a widely practiced method. I also like to use <a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools#automatic-script-creation" rel="nofollow">setuptools Automatic Script Creation</a> so that my console scripts get put wherever they should be (<code>/usr/bin</code>, for example) and are named appropriately automatically. Your first option also facilitates this.   </p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Option 1 works for me. I normally have the script cd to the project directory and then do "python ./script_name.py" so that there are no mysterious path problems ... lazy, but it works consistently.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>There is also <a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-cron/" rel="nofollow">django-cron</a>. It is very simple to use, there is nothing else to install or set-up.</p>

<p><strong>However</strong>, I am not sure about how it really works... I mean that I don't know how the jobs are run <strong>and</strong> if they are run at all when nobody makes a request to the site. But you can try-out !</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I suggest to take a look at <a href="https://bitbucket.org/wnielson/django-chronograph/" rel="nofollow">django-chronograph</a>. Basically it does what you want in a simmilar way to other suggestions + it gives you a possbility to manage your cron jobs via admin panel. Cron jobs have to be implemented as django commands. You can then run all pending jobs by calling</p>

<pre><code>python manage.py cron
</code></pre>

<p>which should be triggered by your cron.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Ashok's suggestion of running management commands via cron works well, but if you're looking for something a little more robust I'd look into a library like <a href="https://github.com/jgorset/django-kronos" rel="nofollow">Kronos</a>:</p>

<pre><code># app/cron.py

import kronos

@kronos.register('0 * * * *')
def task():
    pass
</code></pre>
