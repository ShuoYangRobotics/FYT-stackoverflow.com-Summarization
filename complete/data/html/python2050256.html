<h3>Question (ID-2050256):</h3><h2>AppEngine fetch through a free proxy</h2><p>My (Python) AppEngine program fetches a web page from another site to scrape data from it -- but it seems like the 3rd party site is blocking requests from Google App Engine! -- I can fetch the page from development mode, but not when deployed.</p>

<p>Can I get around this by using a free proxy of some sort?</p>

<p>Can I use a free proxy to hide the fact that I am requesting from App Engine?</p>

<p>How do I find/choose a proxy? -- what do I need?  --  how do I perform the fetch?</p>

<p>Is there anything else I need to know or watch out for?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Probably the correct approach is to request permission from the owners of the site you are scraping. </p>

<p>Even if you use a proxy, there is still a big chance that requests coming through the proxy will end up blocked as well.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Have you considered changing the user-agent?</p>

<pre><code>result = urlfetch.fetch(u,headers = {'User-Agent': "Mozilla/5.0"},allow_truncated=True) 
</code></pre>

<p>The API will always append "AppEngine-Google;" to the user-agent, but this might work if the restriction is not based on a IP address range.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I'm currently having the same problem and i was thinking about this solution (not yet tried) :</p>

<p>-> develop an app that fetch what you want 
-> run it locally
-> fetch your local server from your initial </p>

<p>so the proxy is your computer which you know as not blocked </p>

<p>Let me know if it's works !</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I'm currently having this same problem.  Has anyone gotten this working?</p>

<p>MrGoodFriend, do your potential solution work?  I am not exactly sure what you mean by " fetch your local server from your initial".</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Well to be fair, if they don't want you doing that then you probably shouldn't. It's not nice to be mean.</p>

<p>But if you really want to do it, the best approach would be creating a simple proxy script and running it on a VPS or some computer with a decent enough connection.</p>

<p>Basically you expose a REST API from your server to your GAE, then the server just makes all the same requests it gets to the target site and returns the output.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>What you are talking about is a valid bug in app engine sdk. Have a look at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=544" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=544</a> for bug updates, and workarounds for java and python.</p>
