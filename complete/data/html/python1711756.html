<p>I get the following every time:</p>

<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>It's possible that you have mixed tabs and spaces in your file. You can have python help check for such errors with</p>

<pre><code>python -m tabnanny &lt;name of python file&gt;
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You probably have a mixture of spaces and tabs in your original source file.  Replace all the tabs with four spaces (or vice versa) and you should see the problem straight away.</p>

<p>Your code as pasted into your question doesn't have this problem, but I guess your editor (or your web browser, or Stack Overflow itself...) could have done the tabs-to-spaces conversion without your knowledge.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Can you set your text editor to use spaces for tabs and see if that makes anything obvious?</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Maybe it's this part:</p>

<pre><code>if speed      &gt; self.buginfo["maxspeed"]: self.buginfo["maxspeed"] = speed
if generation &gt; self.buginfo["maxgen"]  : self.buginfo["maxgen"]   = generation
</code></pre>

<p>Try to remove the extra space to make it look aligned.</p>

<pre><code>  Yes:

      x = 1

      long_variable = 3

  No:

      x             = 1
      y             = 2
      long_variable = 3
</code></pre>

<p>Try to follow that coding style.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I would recommend checking your indentation levels all the way through.  Make sure that you are using either tabs all the way or spaces all the way, with no mixture.  I have had odd indentation problems in the past which have been caused by a mixture.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Don't forget the use of """ comments. These need precise indentation too (a 1/2 hr job for me resolving this damn error too!)</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Sorry I can't add comments as my reputation is not high enough :-/, so this will have to be an answer.</p>

<p>As several have commented, the code you have posted contains several (5) syntax errors (twice = instead of == and three ':' missing).</p>

<p>Once the syntax errors corrected I do not have any issue, be it indentation or else; of course it's impossible to see if you have mixed tabs and spaces as somebody else has suggested, which is likely your problem. </p>

<p>But the real point I wanted to underline is that:
tabnanny IS NOT REALIABLE: you might be getting an 'indentation' error when it's actually just a syntax error.</p>

<p>Eg. I got it when I had added one closed parenthesis more than necessary ;-)</p>

<pre><code>i += [func(a, b, [c] if True else None))]
</code></pre>

<p>would provoke a warning from tabnanny for the next line.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>I am using gedit basic version that comes with Ubuntu 11.10.
I had the same error.
This is mainly caused when you mix spaces with tabs.</p>

<p>A good way to differentiate as to which lines have problem would be to go to:
1. edit
2. preferences
3. editor
4. check "automatic indentation"
5. increase the indentation to 12 or some big number</p>

<p>after doing the fifth step you will be able to see the lines of your code that are relly causing problem (these are the lines that have a mix of space and tab)</p>

<p>Make the entire code convention as just TAB or just SPACE (this has to be done manually line by line)</p>

<p>Hope this helps...</p>
