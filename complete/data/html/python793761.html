<h3>Question (ID-793761):</h3><h2>Built in python hash() function</h2><p>Windows XP, Python 2.5:</p>

<pre><code>hash('http://stackoverflow.com') Result: 1934711907
</code></pre>

<p>Google App Engine (<a href="http://shell.appspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://shell.appspot.com/</a>):</p>

<pre><code>hash('http://stackoverflow.com') Result: -5768830964305142685
</code></pre>

<p>Why is that? How can I have a hash function which will give me same results across different platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac)? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>As stated in the documentation, built-in hash() function is <em>not</em> designed for storing resulting hashes somewhere externally. It is used to provide object's hash value, to store them in dictionaries and so on. It's also implementation-specific (GAE uses a modified version of Python). Check out:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class Foo:
...     pass
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = Foo()
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = Foo()
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(a), hash(b)
(-1210747828, -1210747892)
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, they are different, as hash() uses object's <strong>hash</strong> method instead of 'normal' hashing algorithms, such as SHA.</p>

<p>Given the above, the rational choice is to use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/hashlib.html" rel="nofollow">hashlib</a> module.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/hashlib.html?highlight=hash#module-hashlib" rel="nofollow">hashlib</a></p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>The response is absolutely no surprise: in fact </p>

<pre><code>In [1]: -5768830964305142685L &amp; 0xffffffff
Out[1]: 1934711907L
</code></pre>

<p>so if you want to get reliable responses <strong>on ASCII strings</strong>, just get the lower 32 bits as <code>uint</code>. The hash function for strings is 32-bit-safe and <em>almost</em> portable.</p>

<p>On the other side, you can't rely at all on getting the <code>hash()</code> of any object over which you haven't explicitly defined the <code>__hash__</code> method to be invariant. </p>

<p>Over ASCII strings it works just because the hash is calculated on the single characters forming the string, like the following:</p>

<pre><code>class string:
    def __hash__(self):
        if not self:
            return 0 # empty
        value = ord(self[0]) &lt;&lt; 7
        for char in self:
            value = c_mul(1000003, value) ^ ord(char)
        value = value ^ len(self)
        if value == -1:
            value = -2
        return value
</code></pre>

<p>where the <code>c_mul</code> function is the "cyclic" multiplication (without overflow) as in C.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>At a guess, AppEngine is using a 64-bit implementation of Python (-5768830964305142685 won't fit in 32 bits) and your implementation of Python is 32 bits. You can't rely on object hashes being meaningfully comparable between different implementations.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Hash results varies between 32bit and 64bit platforms</p>

<p>If a calculated hash shall be the same on both platforms consider using</p>

<pre><code>def hash32(value):
    return hash(value) &amp; 0xffffffff
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>It probably just asks the operating system provided function, rather than its own algorithm. </p>

<p>As other comments says, use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/hashlib.html?highlight=hash#module-hashlib" rel="nofollow">hashlib</a> or write your own hash function.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>What about sign bit?
For example:
Hex value 0xADFE74A5 represents unsigned 2919134373 and signed -1375832923
Currect value must be signed (sign bit = 1) but python converts it as unsigned and we have incorrect hash value after translation from 64 to 32 bit.</p>

<p>Be careful using:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>def hash32(value):
     return hash(value) &amp; 0xffffffff</p>
</blockquote>
