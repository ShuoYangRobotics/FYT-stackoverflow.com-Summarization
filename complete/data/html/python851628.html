<h3>Question (ID-851628):</h3><h2>Django -- User.DoesNotExist does not exist?</h2><p>I'm trying to get hold of Django. I use Pydev on Eclipse. I have written a simple signup page that I can't get to work. Eclipse complains that User.DoesNotExist is undefined. Most likely, I am missing something trivial. Here's the relevant portion of the code:</p>

<pre><code>from django.contrib.auth.models import User
...
class SignUpForm (forms.Form):
    ...
    def clean_username (self): 
        try:
            User.objects.get(username=self.cleaned_data['username'])
        except User.DoesNotExist:
            return self.cleaned_data['username']
        raise forms.ValidationError(USERNAME_ALREADY_IN_USE)
    ...
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I just discovered Pydev actually has a nice workaround for this.</p>

<p>Go to <strong>Window</strong> > <strong>Preferences</strong>, then <strong>Pydev</strong> > <strong>Editor</strong> > <strong>Code Analysis</strong>.</p>

<p>Click the <strong>Undefined</strong> tab and add "DoesNotExist" to the text box titled <strong>Consider the following names as globals</strong>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The problem is really with PyDev, not your code. What you have done is absolutely correct, but IDEs will always have difficulty resolving attributes in a dynamic language like Python. In the case of the DoesNotExist exception, it is added via a <code>__metaclass__</code> rather than through normal object inheritance, so PyDev is unlikely to be able to find it. However, it should definitely work.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Pydev has a workaround for such cases (when the members are defined at runtime).
Just add #@UndefinedVariable at the end of the string which cause the warning (or ctrl+1 on keyboard when the cursor is at "DoesNotExist"), and it won't complain.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Can Eclipse resolve attributes created runtime via <code>__metaclass__</code>es?</p>

<p>Notice that you never define a <code>DoesNotExist</code> on any of your models and it is not defined on <code>django.db.models.base.Model</code> either.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You can also solve it in a different way: just go to the User class, and add @DynamicAttrs in the docstring.<br>
This will tell PyDev that attributes of the class are added dynamically, and will make it not complain any longer for "issues" like DoesNotExist.</p>

<p>In parituclar he make custom User Fields with code: </p>

<pre><code>class UserField(forms.CharField):
    def clean(self, value):
        super(UserField, self).clean(value)
        try:
            User.objects.get(username=value)
            raise forms.ValidationError("Someone is already using this username. Please pick an other.")
        except User.DoesNotExist:
            return value
</code></pre>

<p>What do you mean by that? Do you have python error and stack trace? This code have to work (as in <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.0/topics/auth/#writing-an-authentication-backend" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>). Looks like an eclipse issue. Just run dev server and see if it works or not:</p>

<pre><code>manage.py runserver
</code></pre>
