<h3>Question (ID-817122):</h3><h2>Delete digits in Python (Regex)</h2><p>I'm trying to delete all digits from a string.
However the next code deletes as well digits contained in any word, and obviously I don't want that.
I've been trying many regular expressions with no success.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<pre><code>s = "This must not b3 delet3d, but the number at the end yes 134411"
s = re.sub("\d+", "", s)
print s
</code></pre>

<p>Result:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This must not b deletd, but the number at the end yes</p>
</blockquote>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Try this:</p>

<pre><code>"\b\d+\b"
</code></pre>

<p>That'll match only those digits that are not part of another word.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Add a space before the \d+.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s = "This must not b3 delet3d, but the number at the end yes 134411"
&gt;&gt;&gt; s = re.sub(" \d+", " ", s)
&gt;&gt;&gt; s
'This must not b3 delet3d, but the number at the end yes '
</code></pre>

<p>Edit:  After looking at the comments, I decided to form a more complete answer.  I think this accounts for all the cases.</p>

<pre><code>s = re.sub("^\d+\s|\s\d+\s|\s\d+$", " ", s)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If your number is allways at the end of your strings try :
re.sub("\d+$", "", s)</p>

<p>otherwise, you may try
re.sub("(\s)\d+(\s)", "\1\2", s)</p>

<p>You can adjust the back-references to keep only one or two of the spaces (\s match any white separator)</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Using <code>\s</code> isn't very good, since it doesn't handle tabs, et al. A first cut at a better solution is:</p>

<pre><code>re.sub(r"\b\d+\b", "", s)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the pattern is a raw string because <code>\b</code> is normally the backspace escape for strings, and we want the special word boundary regex escape instead. A slightly fancier version is:</p>

<pre><code>re.sub(r"$\d+\W+|\b\d+\b|\W+\d+$", "", s)
</code></pre>

<p>That tries to remove leading/trailing whitespace when there are digits at the beginning/end of the string. I say "tries" because if there are multiple numbers at the end then you still have some spaces.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I don't know what your real situation looks like, but most of the answers look like they won't handle negative numbers or decimals,</p>

<p><code>re.sub(r"(\b|\s+\-?|^\-?)(\d+|\d*\.\d+)\b","")</code></p>

<p>The above should also handle things like,</p>

<p>"This must not b3 delet3d, but the number at the end yes -134.411"</p>

<p>But this is still incomplete - you probably need a more complete definition of what you can expect to find in the files you need to parse.</p>

<p>Edit: it's also worth noting that '\b' changes depending on the locale/character set you are using so you need to be a little careful with that.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>To handle digit strings at the beginning of a line as well:</p>

<pre><code>s = re.sub(r"(^|\W)\d+", "", s)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Non-regex solution:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s = "This must not b3 delet3d, but the number at the end yes 134411"
&gt;&gt;&gt; " ".join([x for x in s.split(" ") if not x.isdigit()])
'This must not b3 delet3d, but the number at the end yes'
</code></pre>

<p>Splits by <code>" "</code>, and checks if the chunk is a number by doing <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#str.isdigit" rel="nofollow"><code>str().isdigit()</code></a>, then joins them back together. More verbosely (not using a list comprehension):</p>

<pre><code>words = s.split(" ")
non_digits = []
for word in words:
    if not word.isdigit():
        non_digits.append(word)

" ".join(non_digits)
</code></pre>
