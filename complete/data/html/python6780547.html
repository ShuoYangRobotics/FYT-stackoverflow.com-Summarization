<h3>Question (ID-6780547):</h3><h2>Keyed Collection in Python?</h2><p>Is there any equivalent to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms132438.aspx" rel="nofollow">KeyedCollection</a> in Python, i.e. a set where the elements have (or dynamically generate) their own keys?</p>

<p>i.e. the goal here is to <strong>avoid storing the key in two places</strong>, and therefore dictionaries are less than ideal (hence the question).</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You can simulate that very easily:</p>

<pre><code>class KeyedObject(object):
    def get_key(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("You must subclass this before you can use it.")

class KeyedDict(dict):
    def append(self, obj):
        self[obj.get_key()] = obj
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can use a <code>KeyedDict</code> instead of <code>dict</code> with subclasses of <code>KeyedObject</code> (where <code>get_key</code> return a valid key based on some object property).</p>

  <p>Because semantically, it doesn't make as much sense. When an object
  knows its key, it doesn't make sense to put it in a dictionary -- it's
  not a key-value pair. It's more of a semantic issue than anything
  else.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With this constraint, there is nothing in Python that does what you want.  I suggest you use a dict and not worry about this level of detail on the semantics.  @Gabi Purcaru's answer shows how you can create an object with the interface you want.  Why get bothered about how it's working internally?  </p>

<p>It could be that C#'s KeyedCollection is doing the same thing under the covers: asking the object for its key and then storing the key for fast access. In fact, from the docs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By default, the KeyedCollection(Of TKey, TItem) includes a lookup
  dictionary that you can obtain with the Dictionary property. When an
  item is added to the KeyedCollection(Of TKey, TItem), the item's key
  is extracted once and saved in the lookup dictionary for faster
  searches. This behavior is overridden by specifying a dictionary
  creation threshold when you create the KeyedCollection(Of TKey,
  TItem). The lookup dictionary is created the first time the number of
  elements exceeds that threshold. If you specify â€“1 as the threshold,
  the lookup dictionary is never created.</p>
</blockquote>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Given your constraints, everyone trying to implement what you're looking for using a <code>dict</code> is barking up the wrong tree. Instead, you should write a <code>list</code> subclass that overrides <code>__getitem__</code> to provide the behavior you want. I've written it so it tries to get the desired item by index first, then falls back to searching for the item by the <code>key</code> attribute of the contained objects. (This could be a property if the object needs to determine this dynamically.)</p>

<p>There's no way to avoid a linear search if you don't want to duplicate something somewhere; I am sure the C# implementation does exactly the same thing if you don't allow it to use a dictionary to store the keys.</p>

<pre><code>class KeyedCollection(list):
     def __getitem__(self, key):
         if isinstance(key, int) or isinstance(key, slice):
             return list.__getitem__(key)
         for item in self:
             if getattr(item, "key", 0) == key:
                 return item
         raise KeyError('item with key `%s` not found' % key)
</code></pre>

<p>You would probably also want to override <code>__contains__</code> in a similar manner so you could say <code>if "key" in kc...</code>. If you want to make it even more like a <code>dict</code>, you could also implement <code>keys()</code> and so on. They will be equally inefficient, but you will have an API like a <code>dict</code>, that also works like a list.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Why not simply use a <code>dict</code>?  If the key already exists, a reference to the key will be used in the dict; it won't be senselessly duplicated.</p>

<pre><code>class MyExample(object):
    def __init__(self, key, value):
        self.key = key
        self.value = value

m = MyExample("foo", "bar")
d = {}

d[m.key] = m

first_key = d.keys()[0]
first_key is m.key  # returns True
</code></pre>

<p>If the key doesn't already exist, a copy of it will be saved, but I don't see that as a problem.</p>

<pre><code>def lame_hash(s):
    h = 0
    for ch in s:
        h ^= ord(ch)
    return h

d = {}
d[lame_hash(m.key)] = m
print d  # key value is 102 which is stored in the dict

lame_hash(m.key) in d  # returns True
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I'm not sure if this is what you meant, but this dictionary will create it's own keys as you add to it...</p>

<pre><code>class KeyedCollection(dict):
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_key = 0
    def add(self, item):
        self[self.current_key] = item

abc = KeyedCollection()
abc.add('bob')
abc.add('jane')
&gt;&gt;&gt; abc
{0: 'bob', 1: 'jane'}
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>How about a <code>set()</code>? The elements can have their own k</p>
