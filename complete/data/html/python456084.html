<h3>Question (ID-456084):</h3><h2>How do I do what strtok() does in C, in Python?</h2><p>I am learning Python and trying to figure out an efficient way to tokenize a string of numbers separated by commas into a list. Well formed cases work as I expect, but less well formed cases not so much.</p>

<p>If I have this:</p>

<pre><code>A = '1,2,3,4'
B = [int(x) for x in A.split(',')]

B results in [1, 2, 3, 4]
</code></pre>

<p>which is what I expect, but if the string is something more like</p>

<pre><code>A = '1,,2,3,4,'
</code></pre>

<p>if I'm using the same list comprehension expression for B as above, I get an exception. I think I understand why (because some of the "x" string values are not integers), but I'm thinking that there would be a way to parse this still quite elegantly such that tokenization of the string a works a bit more directly like <strong><em>strtok(A,",\n\t")</em></strong> would have done when called iteratively in C.</p>

<p>To be clear what I am asking; I am looking for an elegant/efficient/typical way in Python to have all of the following example cases of strings:</p>

<pre><code>A='1,,2,3,\n,4,\n'
A='1,2,3,4'
A=',1,2,3,4,\t\n'
A='\n\t,1,2,3,,4\n'
</code></pre>

<p>return with the same list of:</p>

<pre><code>B=[1,2,3,4]
</code></pre>

<p>via some sort of compact expression.</p>

<pre><code>A = '1, 2,,3,4  '
B = [int(x) for x in A.split(',') if x.strip()]
</code></pre>

<p>x.strip() trims whitespace from the string, which will make it empty if the string is all whitespace. An empty string is "false" in a boolean context, so it's filtered by the if part of the list comprehension.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Mmm, functional goodness (with a bit of generator expression thrown in):</p>

<pre><code>a = "1,2,,3,4,"
print map(int, filter(None, (i.strip() for i in a.split(','))))
</code></pre>

<p>For full functional joy:</p>

<pre><code>import string
a = "1,2,,3,4,"
print map(int, filter(None, map(string.strip, a.split(','))))
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Generally, I try to avoid regular expressions, but if you want to split on a bunch of different things, they work.  Try this:</p>

<pre><code>import re
result = [int(x) for x in filter(None, re.split('[,\n,\t]', A))]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>How about this?</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = "1,2,,3,4,"
&gt;&gt;&gt; map(int,filter(None,a.split(",")))
[1, 2, 3, 4]
</code></pre>

<p>filter will remove all false values (i.e. empty strings), which are then mapped to int.</p>

<p>EDIT: Just tested this against the above posted versions, and it seems to be significantly faster, 15% or so compared to the strip() one and more than twice as fast as the isdigit() one</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>This will work, and never raise an exception, if all the numbers are ints. The <code>isdigit()</code> call is false if there's a decimal point in the string.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; nums = ['1,,2,3,\n,4\n', '1,2,3,4', ',1,2,3,4,\t\n', '\n\t,1,2,3,,4\n']
&gt;&gt;&gt; for n in nums:
...     [ int(i.strip()) for i in n if i.strip() and i.strip().isdigit() ]
... 
[1, 2, 3, 4]
[1, 2, 3, 4]
[1, 2, 3, 4]
[1, 2, 3, 4]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Why not just wrap in a try except block which catches anything not an integer?</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Why accept inferior substitutes that cannot segfault your interpreter? With ctypes you can just call the real thing! :-)</p>

<pre><code># strtok in Python
from ctypes import c_char_p, cdll

try: libc = cdll.LoadLibrary('libc.so.6')
except WindowsError:
     libc = cdll.LoadLibrary('msvcrt.dll')

libc.strtok.restype = c_char_p
dat = c_char_p("1,,2,3,4")
sep = c_char_p(",\n\t")
result = [libc.strtok(dat, sep)] + list(iter(lambda: libc.strtok(None, sep), None))
print(result)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>I'd guess regular expressions are the way to go: <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/re.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/library/re.html</a></p>
