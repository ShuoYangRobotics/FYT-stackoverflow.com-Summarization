<h3>Question (ID-8168194):</h3><h2>subtraction operator python</h2><p>I want to reduce the number of "the" words from a by 2. But this code doesn't seem to run. I cannot understand why the multiplication operator works but the subtraction operator doesn't.</p>

<pre><code>b = "the"
a = b * 5
print a
a -= (b * 2)  
print a
</code></pre>

<p>output</p>

<pre><code>the 
the the the the the 
Traceback (most recent call last):
    a -=  (b * 2)
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -=: 'str' and 'str'
</code></pre>

<p>How can I reduce the number of "the" 's in a by 2. If this cannot be done like this then is there a easier method perform this?</p>

<p>I am not substracting (you cannot really do it with strings), I am removing twice the length of <code>b</code> from the end of <code>a</code>, ignoring its real value.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>To reduce the number of "the" by 2 in you word, try with the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=replace#str.replace" rel="nofollow">replace</a> method : </p>

<pre><code>b = "the"
a = b * 5
print a
&gt;&gt;&gt; "thethethethethe"
a = a.replace(b, "", 2)  # or a.replace(b*2, "", 1) if you want to remove "thethe" from the string
print a
&gt;&gt;&gt; "thethethe"
</code></pre>

<p>If you wanted to remove the "the" by starting from the end, use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=replace#str.rsplit" rel="nofollow">rsplit()</a></p>

<pre><code>b = "the"
a = "theAtheBthethe"
a = "".join(a.rsplit("the", 2))   # or "".join(a.rsplit("thethe", 1)) if you want to remove "theth" of the string
print a
&gt;&gt;&gt; "theAtheB"
</code></pre>

<p>As <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=replace#sequence-types-str-unicode-list-tuple-bytearray-buffer-xrange" rel="nofollow">described here</a>, the * operator is supported by string (and unicode, list, tuple, bytearray, buffer, xrange types), <code>b * 5</code>  returns 5 copies of b concatenated.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Depends if you want to chop them off the start or the end, you can use array subsets:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a[2*len("the"):]
'thethethe'
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[:-(2*len("the"))]
'thethethe'
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>There is no support for subtraction operator in case of strings, but you can simply add one:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class MyStr(str):
    def __init__(self, val):
        return str.__init__(self, val)
    def __sub__(self, other):
        if self.count(other) &gt; 0:
            return self.replace(other, '', 1)
        else:
            return self
</code></pre>

<p>and this will work in the following way:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = MyStr('thethethethethe')
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = a - 'the'
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
'thethethethethe'
&gt;&gt;&gt; b
'thethethethe'
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = a - 2 * 'the'
&gt;&gt;&gt; b
'thethethe'
</code></pre>

<p>Regarding <code>a - 2 * 'the'</code> operation you should be aware that this is not " <em>remove twice 'the' string from a</em> ", but " <em>remove result of (2 times 'the') from a</em> " (first multiply "<code>the</code>" by <code>2</code> and then subtract from <code>a</code>).</p>

<p>Is this what you expected?</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><pre><code>a = a.rpartition(b * 2)[0]
</code></pre>

<p>should do this, cutting from the right side. If you don't have any examples of <code>'thethe'</code> in <code>a</code>, it will return the empty string <code>''</code>. It won't work if you have multiple <code>'the'</code>s that are separated by other characters. For that, you could use <code>a.rpartition(b)[0]</code> twice. If you want to cut from the left instead, use <code>a.partition(b * 2)[2]</code>.</p>

<p>Why doesn't subtracting work? Using addition and multiplication is a convenience feature for working with strings. The semantics of subtracting (or dividing) <code>str</code>s is not defined for Python, so you can't use it that way.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Plus operator work because "+" concatenate whilst minus don't operate on strings. You can try something using regular expression, like:</p>

<pre><code>import re

s="the"*5
expr="the"

print s

# s -= 2
print "".join(re.findall(expr,s)[:-2])

# s -=3
print "".join(re.findall(expr,s)[:-3])
</code></pre>
