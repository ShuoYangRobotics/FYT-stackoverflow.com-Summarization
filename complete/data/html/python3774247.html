<h3>Question (ID-3774247):</h3><h2>What do we call this (new?) higher-order function?</h2><p>I am trying to name what I think is a new idea for a higher-order function. To the important part, here is the code in Python and Haskell to demonstrate the concept, which will be explained afterward.</p>

<p>Python:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def pleat(f, l):
       return map(lambda t: f(*t), zip(l, l[1:]))
&gt;&gt;&gt; pleat(operator.add, [0, 1, 2, 3])
[1, 3, 5]
</code></pre>

<p>Haskell:</p>

<pre><code>Prelude&gt; let pleatWith f xs = zipWith f xs (drop 1 xs)
Prelude&gt; pleatWith (+) [0,1,2,3]
[1,3,5]
</code></pre>

<p>As you may be able to infer, the sequence is being iterated through, utilizing adjacent elements as the parameters for the function you pass it, projecting the results into a new sequence. So, has anyone seen the functionality we've created? Is this familiar at all to those in the functional community? If not, what do we name it?</p>

<pre><code>---- Update ----
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Pleat</strong> wins!</p>

<pre><code>Prelude&gt; let pleat xs = zip xs (drop 1 xs)
Prelude&gt; pleat [1..4]
[(1,2),(2,3),(3,4)]

Prelude&gt; let pleatWith f xs = zipWith f xs (drop 1 xs)
Prelude&gt; pleatWith (+) [1..4]
[3,5,7]

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Since it's similar to "fold" but doesn't collapse the list into a single value, how about "crease"? If you keep "creasing", you end up "folding" (sort of). </p>

<p>We could go with a cooking metaphor and call it "pinch", like pinching the crust of a pie, though this might suggest a circular zipping, where the last element of the list is paired with the first.</p>

<pre><code>def pinch(f, l):
    return map(lambda t: f(*t), zip(l, l[1:]+l[:1]))
</code></pre>

<p>(If you only like one of "crease" or "pinch", please note so as a comment. Should these be separate suggestions?)</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Here's another implementation for Python which works if <code>l</code> is a generator too</p>

<pre><code>import itertools as it

def apply_pairwise(f, l):
    left, right = it.tee(l)
    next(right)
    return it.starmap(f, it.izip(left, right))
</code></pre>

<p>I think <code>apply_pairwise</code> is a better name</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>In Python the <code>meld</code> equivalent is in the itertools receipes and called pairwise.</p>

<pre><code>from itertools import starmap, izp, tee

def pairwise(iterable):
    "s -&gt; (s0,s1), (s1,s2), (s2, s3), ..."
    a, b = tee(iterable)
    next(b, None)
    return izip(a, b)
</code></pre>

<p>So I would call it:</p>

<pre><code>def pairwith(func, seq):
    return starmap(func, pairwise(seq))
</code></pre>

<p>I think this makes sense because when you call it with the identity function, it simply returns pairs.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I really can't see any codified names for this anywhere in Python, that's for sure.  "Merge" is good but spoken for in a variety of other contexts.  "Plow" tends to be unused and supplies a great visual of pushing steadily through a line of soil.  Maybe I've just spent too much time gardening.</p>

<p>I also expanded the principle to allow functions that receive any number of parameters.  </p>

<p>You might also consider: Pleat.  It describes well the way you're taking a list (like a long strand of fabric) and bunching segments of it together.  </p>

<pre><code>import operator

def stagger(l, w):
    if len(l)&gt;=w:
        return [tuple(l[0:w])]+stagger(l[1:], w)
    return []

def pleat(f, l, w=2):
    return map(lambda p: f(*p), stagger(l, w))

print pleat(operator.add, range(10))
print pleat(lambda x, y, z: x*y/z, range(3, 13), 3)
print pleat(lambda x: "~%s~"%(x), range(10), 1)
print pleat(lambda a, b, x, y: a+b==x+y, [3, 2, 4, 1, 5, 0, 9, 9, 0], 4)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p><code>zipWithTail</code> or <code>adjacentPairs</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I vote for <code>smearWith</code> or <code>smudgeWith</code> because it's like you are smearing/smudging the operation across the list.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>this seems like ruby's <code>each_cons</code></p>

<pre><code>ruby-1.9.2-p0 &gt; (1..10).each_cons(2).to_a

=&gt; [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5], [5, 6], [6, 7], [7, 8], [8, 9], [9, 10]] 
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>This reminds me of <em>convolution</em> from image processing. But not sure if this is mathematically correct.</p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>The generalized variant of the plain zip version of this is what I would think of as <code>window</code>. Not at a ghci terminal right now, but I think <code>window n = take n . tails</code>. Then your function is <code>zipWith (\[x,yj -&gt; f x y) . window 2</code>. This sort of style naturally works better when f is of type <code>[a] -&gt; b</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#10</b><br /><p>in C++ Standard Template Library, it is called <a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/adjacent_difference.html" rel="nofollow">adjacent_difference</a> (though the operator can be any operation, not just subtraction)</p>
<br /><b>#11</b><br /><p><strike>So because there seems to be no name for this I suggest 'merger' or simple 'merge' because you are merging adjacent values together.</strike></p>

<p>So merge is already taken so I now suggest 'meld' (or 'merger' still but that may be too close to 'merge')</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>meld :: (a -&gt; a -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]
meld _ [] = []
meld f xs = zipWith f (init xs) (tail xs)
</code></pre>

<p>Which can be used as:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; meld (+) [1..10]
[3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19]
&gt; meld compare "hello world"
[GT,LT,EQ,LT,GT,LT,GT,LT,GT,GT]
</code></pre>

<p>Where the second example makes no real sense but makes a cool example.</p>
<br /><b>#12</b><br /><p>Using Mathematica</p>

<p><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Plus.html?q=Plus&amp;lang=en" rel="nofollow">Plus</a> <a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Apply.html#1519920741" rel="nofollow">@@@</a> <a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Partition.html?q=Partition&amp;lang=en" rel="nofollow">Partition</a>[{0, 1, 2, 3}, 2, 1]
or either of these more verbose alternatives</p>

<pre><code>Apply[Plus, Partition[{0, 1, 2, 3}, 2, 1], {1}]
Map[Apply[Plus, #] &amp;, Partition[{0, 1, 2, 3}, 2, 1]]
</code></pre>

<p>I have used and enjoyed this higher order function in many languages but I have enjoyed it the most in Mathematica; it seems succinct and flexible broken down into Partition and Apply with levelspec option.</p>
<br /><b>#13</b><br /><p>I'd be tempted to call it <em>contour</em> as I've used it for "contour" processing in music software - at the time I called it twomap or something silly like that.</p>

<p>There are also two specific named 'contours' in music processing one is gross contour - does the pitch go up or down. The other is refined contour where the the contour is either up, down, leap up or leap down, though I can't seem to find a reference for how large the semitone difference has to be to make a leap. </p>
<br /><b>#14</b><br /><p>Nice idiom!  I just needed to use this in Perl to determine the time between sequential events.  Here's what I ended up with.</p>

<pre><code>sub pinch(&amp;@) {
  my ( $f, @list ) = @_;
  no strict "refs";

  use vars qw( $a $b );

  my $caller = caller;
  local( *{$caller . "::a"} ) = \my $a;
  local( *{$caller . "::b"} ) = \my $b;

  my @res;
  for ( my $i = 0; $i &lt; @list - 1; ++$i ) {
    $a = $list[$i];
    $b = $list[$i + 1];
    push( @res, $f-&gt;() );
  }
  wantarray ? @res : \@res;
}

print join( ",", pinch { $b - $a } qw( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ) ), $/;
# ==&gt; 1,1,1,1,1,1
</code></pre>

<p>The implementation could probably be prettier if I'd made it dependent on <strong>List::Util</strong>, but... meh!</p>
