<h3>Question (ID-6683449):</h3><h2>Create list by repeated application of function</h2><p>I want this:</p>

<pre><code>[foo() for _ in xrange (100)]
</code></pre>

<p>but beautifuller. ?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I'm afraid you're not gonna get it any prettier than that in Python, except that some people would advise against <code>_</code> for an "anonymous" variable. This is the Pythonic idiom for doing what you want.</p>

<p>(The <code>_</code> can be considered confusing to novices because it can be mistaken for special syntax. I use it, but only in the "expert parts" of my code. I also encounter it more and more often, but opinion still seems a bit divided on this one.)</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You can write a generator <code>repeat</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code>def repeat(times, func, *args, **kwargs):
    for _ in xrange(times):
        yield func(*args, **kwargs)
</code></pre>

<p>Then:</p>

<pre><code>list(repeat(100, foo))
</code></pre>

<p>It also accepts arguments to be passed on to the function, so you can:</p>

<pre><code>from random import randint
list(repeat(100, randint, 1, 100))   # 100 random ints between 1 and 100
</code></pre>

<p>Since it's a generator, you can pipe it into any kind of iterable, be it a <code>list</code> (as here) or a <code>tuple</code> or a <code>set</code>, or use it in a comprehension or a loop.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>In case <code>foo()</code> always returns the same result, you could use</p>

<pre><code>[foo()]*100
</code></pre>

<p>This has the advantage that <code>foo()</code> is only called once.</p>

<p>Edit: As @larsmans points out this only makes sense though if <code>foo()</code> returns an <em>immutable</em> result.</p>

<p>In all other cases, your solution is fine!</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Depending on what it does, you can make <code>foo()</code> a generator.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Depending on your definition of "beautifuller", you may prefer this:</p>

<p><code>map(lambda x: foo(), xrange(100))</code></p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Your list comprehension is already beatiful and effective but if you need several options to do the same things then i think you can use map here. In case you need to call a certain function the specified number of times use:</p>

<pre><code># in case your func looks like
def func():
    # do something
#then
map(func(), xrange(numberOfTimes))
</code></pre>

<p>In case your function need value from range then you can use map with lambda:</p>

<pre><code># in case your func looks like
def func(value):
    # do something with value
#then
map(lambda val: func(val), xrange(numberOfTimes))
</code></pre>

<p>Or in case you need to use data from several lists of the same length:</p>

<pre><code># in case your func looks like
def func(value1, value2):
    # do something with values
#then
map(lambda val: func(*val), zip(xrange(10), xrange(10,20)))
</code></pre>

<p>And so on...</p>
