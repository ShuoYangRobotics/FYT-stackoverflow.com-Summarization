<h3>Question (ID-5390286):</h3><h2>Type of an instance variable</h2><p>Suppose that I have a class like this</p>

<pre><code>class Employee:
    pass
</code></pre>

<p>I create two objects for <code>Employee</code> as below</p>

<pre><code>john = Employee()
rob = Employee()
</code></pre>

<p>..and create instance variables</p>

<pre><code>john.age = 12
rob.age = '15'
</code></pre>

<p>The compiler accepts both and prints the age (john's age in <code>int</code> and rob's age in <code>string</code>). How is this logical? The same data attribute having different type in each object.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Be sure to understand this fundamental principle: <strong>in Python, <em>variables</em> don't have types. <em>Values</em> have types.</strong> This is the essence of Python's being a dynamically-typed language similarly to Lisp and Javascript, but unlike C, C++ and Java.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; foo = 5       # foo now holds a value of type int
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo = 'hello' # foo now holds a value of type string
</code></pre>

<p>Here's an excerpt from Wikipedia's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#Typing" rel="nofollow">entry on typing</a> in Python:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Python uses duck typing and has typed
  objects but untyped variable names.
  Type constraints are not checked at
  compile time; rather, operations on an
  object may fail, signifying that the
  given object is not of a suitable
  type. Despite being dynamically typed,
  Python is strongly typed, forbidding
  operations that are not well-defined
  (for example, adding a number to a
  string) rather than silently
  attempting to make sense of them.</p>

<p>Do read more on this subject (especially what Duck Typing is) if you want to learn Python.</p>

<p>P.S. This issue is totally orthogonal to attributes of objects. Attributes are just other "variables" in Python, which also can hold values. These values can be of different types.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Because by saying <code>rob.age</code> you are <strong>not</strong> creating a class-wide data attribute that has a specific type; you are merely creating an instance-local, instance-specific attribute that refers to a concrete entity, the string <code>'15'</code>. To create a class-wide attribute you would have to say <code>Employee.age = …</code> or set <code>age</code> inside the <code>class Employee:</code> block. By setting the attribute to a descriptor, I suppose you could check its type every time it is set and restrict it to an integer or string or whatever; but in general, either a class attribute or an instance attribute is just a name for an object, and all Python cares is that <code>.age</code> names an object.</p>

<p>And note that Python could not really guess what you mean anyway. If you say that <code>john.age</code> is 12, you seem to want Python to guess that all other <code>.age</code> attributes should also be numbers. But why shouldn't Python go even further, and guess that they are integers — or better yet, that they are positive even integers? I really do not think it would be reasonable in any case for Python to extrapolate from a single assignment to some kind of guess as to how you will treat that attribute in all other instances of the class.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>It's fundamentally what you get when you have a dynamically typed language.</p>

<p>Type is determined at runtime not at declaration.</p>

<p>It has advantages and disadvantages, but I believe the advantages outweigh its disadvantages in most development contexts.</p>

<p>(It's what Ruby, Python, PHP, etc. do)</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Python's compiler does not care what type of value you bind to an attribute/name, nor does it have to; Python's dynamic nature means that the important type checks (which are usually actually attribute checks) are done at runtime.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You have to think of <code>age</code> as a reference to an object. The object can be of any type. It is the way the language is defined.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>The term <em>"variable"</em> is  confusioning in Python.</p>
