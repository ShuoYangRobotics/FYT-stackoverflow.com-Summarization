<h3>Question (ID-2541528):</h3><h2>Noob Python Question: List Confusion</h2><p>I'm trying to transfer the contents of one list to another, but it's not working and I don't know why not. My code looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
list2 = []

for item in list1:
    list2.append(item)
    list1.remove(item)
</code></pre>

<p>But if I run it my output looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; list1
[2, 4, 6]
&gt;&gt;&gt; list2
[1, 3, 5]
</code></pre>

<p>My question is threefold, I guess: Why is this happening, how do I make it work, and am I overlooking an incredibly simple solution like a 'move' statement or something?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-10):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You're deleting items from list1 while you're iterating over it.</p>

<p>That's asking for trouble.</p>

<p>Try this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; list1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
&gt;&gt;&gt; list2 = []
&gt;&gt;&gt; list2 = list1[:] # we copy every element from list1 using a slice
&gt;&gt;&gt; del list1[:] # we delete every element from list1
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The reason is that you're (appending and) <strong>removing</strong> from the first list whereby it gets smaller. So the iterator stops before the whole list could be walked through.</p>

<p>To achieve what you want, do this:</p>

<pre><code>list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
list2 = []

# You couldn't just make 'list1_copy = list1',
# because this would just copy (share) the reference.
# (i.e. when you change list1_copy, list1 will also change)

# this will make a (new) copy of list1
# so you can happily iterate over it ( without anything getting lost :)
list1_copy = list1[:]

for item in list1_copy:
    list2.append(item)
    list1.remove(item)
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>list1[start:end:step]</code> is the <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/introduction.html#lists" rel="nofollow">slicing syntax</a>: when you leave <em>start</em> empty it defaults to 0, when you leave <em>end</em> empty it is the highest possible value. So list1[:] means <em>everything in it</em>. (thanks to Wallacoloo)</p>

<p>Like some dudes said, you could also use the <code>extend</code>-method of the <code>list</code>-object to just copy the one list to another, if this was your intention. (But I choosed the way above, because this is near to your approach.)</p>

<p>As you are new to python, I have something for you: <a href="http://diveintopython3.org/" rel="nofollow">Dive Into Python 3</a> - it's free and easy. - Have fun!</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Essential debugging skill:  Add <code>print</code> statements.  (or <code>print</code> functions in Python 3)</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; list1= [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
&gt;&gt;&gt; for item in list1:
...     print item
...     list1.remove(item)
...     print list1
... 
1
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
3
[2, 4, 5, 6]
5
[2, 4, 6]
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that Python is trying to step through the <strong>positions</strong> of the list, but you keep removing items from the list, making the <strong>positions</strong> become meaningless.</p>

<p>Python picks the item at position 0 from the list.</p>

<p>You then remove the item, changing the list.</p>

<p>Python then picks the item at position 1 from the list (appearing to skip an item)</p>

<p>You then remove that item, changing the list.</p>

<p>Python then picks the item at position 2 from the list (appearing to skip an item)</p>

<p>You then remove the item, changing the list.</p>

<p>Python would then like to pick the item at position 3, but there's no such item.  So the loop stops.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You shouldn't modify a list while you iterate over it. This causes the iterator to point at the wrong item. After the first item is handled, the iterator is pointing at index = 1, but because you've removed an item, the next item is now at index zero, so it will be skipped. This is why you are only handling every other item.</p>

<p>Try:</p>

<pre><code> list2.extend(list1) # This appends all items from list1 to list2.
 del list1[:] # From ChristopheD's post.
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>There is also the humble copy function (or deepcopy if you have complex objects and not just integers in your list):</p>

<pre><code>from copy import copy

list2 = copy(list1)
</code></pre>

<p>You might get a more appropriate answer if you explain what you're trying to accomplish (unless you're just learning about python lists).</p>

<p>"Variables" in Python are just names/references, so the destructive copy you seem to want to do seems kind of strange.  If you want list2 to have the same values as list1 you can just do:</p>

<pre><code>list2 = list1 # now they are both referring to the same list
</code></pre>

<p>And if after that you want to use list1 for something else, you can just do:</p>

<pre><code>list1 = ['A', 'B', 'C']
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>As you can see in other answers, you are trying to modify the list while iterating over it. This doesn't work. There are many ways to copy one list to another. I did some tests to see how fast each approach is:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; timeit.Timer('list2 = list1[:]', 'list1 = range(10**3)').timeit(10**6)
3.9134418964385986

&gt;&gt;&gt; timeit.Timer('list2 = []; list2.extend(list1)', 'list1 = range(10**3)').timeit(10**6)
4.9082601070404053

&gt;&gt;&gt; timeit.Timer('list2 = copy.copy(list1)', 'import copy; list1 = range(10**3)').timeit(10**6)
7.5023419857025146

&gt;&gt;&gt; timeit.Timer('list2 = [i for i in list1]', 'list1 = range(10**3)').timeit(10**6)
95.697894811630249
</code></pre>

<p>The slice syntax is the fastest. It's much faster than using a list comprehension.</p>

<p>To clear a list, you can use:</p>

<pre><code>del list1[:]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Exactly as ChristopheD says.</p>

<p>Could do this:</p>

<pre><code>list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
list2 = []

for item in list1:
    list2.append(item)

list1 = []
</code></pre>

<p>That'll clear list1.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> He/she has updated their post. I'll leave this up as a slight alternative.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Using a list comprehension:</p>

<pre><code>list2 = [item for item in list1]
</code></pre>

<p>Bind the name <code>list2</code> to the the same object as <code>list1</code>:</p>

<pre><code>list2 = list1
</code></pre>

<p>(Note that if you modify the contents of <code>list1</code>, <code>list2</code> will be change accordingly.)</p>

<p>Create a copy of <code>list1</code> and bind it to the name <code>list2</code>:</p>

<pre><code>list2 = list1[:]
</code></pre>

<p>In this case list1 and list2 are different objects.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>Try this instead:</p>

<pre><code>list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
list2 = []

list2.extend(list1)
list1[:] = []
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>@potatocubed: Many of the answers given solve the trivial example you gave ("move list1 to list2"), but don't really explain the "why" of the deeper problem, which is modifying a list as you iterate over it. Study S.Lott's answer...</p>
