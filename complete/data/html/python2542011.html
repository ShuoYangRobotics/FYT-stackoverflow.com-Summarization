<h3>Question (ID-2542011):</h3><h2>Most efficient way to store IP Address in MySQL</h2><p>What is the most efficient way to store and retrieve IP addresses in MySQL?  Right now I'm doing:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM logins WHERE ip = '1.2.3.4'
</code></pre>

<p>Where ip is a <code>VARCHAR(15)</code> field.</p>

<p>Is there a better way to do this?  I'm using Python.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>For <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4" rel="nofollow">IPv4 addresses</a>, you may want to store them as an <code>int unsigned</code> and use the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/miscellaneous-functions.html#function_inet-aton" rel="nofollow"><code>INET_ATON()</code></a> and <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/miscellaneous-functions.html#function_inet-ntoa" rel="nofollow"><code>INET_NTOA()</code></a> functions to return the IP address from its numeric value, and vice versa. </p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT INET_ATON('127.0.0.1');

+------------------------+
| INET_ATON('127.0.0.1') |
+------------------------+
|             2130706433 | 
+------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)


SELECT INET_NTOA('2130706433');

+-------------------------+
| INET_NTOA('2130706433') |
+-------------------------+
| 127.0.0.1               | 
+-------------------------+
1 row in set (0.02 sec)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>If you only want to store IPv4 addresses, then you can store them in a 32-bit integer field.</p>

<p>If you want to support IPv6 as well, then a string is probably the most easy-to-read/use way (though you could technically store them in a 16-byte <code>VARBINARY()</code> field, it would be annoying trying to generate SQL statements to select by IP address "by hand")</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>The most important thing is to make sure that column is indexed. This could make a huge difference to queries based on IP address.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Why do you need it to be faster? ... <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PrematureOptimization" rel="nofollow">"Premature optimization"</a></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>maybe store the integer value directly in an integer field?  An IP address is basically 4 "shorts".</p>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Whatever is easiest for you to work with.  The size or speed issue is not an issue until you know it is an issue by profiling.  In some cases, a string might be easier to work with if you need to do partial matching.  But as a space or performance issue, don't worry about it unless you have real cause to worry about it.</p>
