<h3>Question (ID-5268017):</h3><h2>Why does Python compile modules but not the script being run?</h2><p>Why does Python compile libraries that are used in a script, but not the script being called itself?</p>

<p>For instance,</p>

<p>If there is <code>main.py</code> and <code>module.py</code>, and Python is run by doing <code>python main.py</code>, there will be a compiled file <code>module.pyc</code> but not one for main.  Why?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>Adding bounty. I don't think this has been properly answered.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If the response is potential disk permissions for the directory of <code>main.py</code>, why does Python compile modules? They are just as likely (if not more likely) to appear in a location where the user does not have write access. Python could compile <code>main</code> if it is writable, or alternatively in another directory.</p></li>
<li><p>If the reason is that benefits will be minimal, consider the situation when the script will be used a large number of times (such as in a CGI application). </p></li>

<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Files are compiled upon import. It isn't a security thing.  It is simply that if you import it python saves the output. See <a href="http://effbot.org/zone/python-compile.htm" rel="nofollow">this post</a> by Fredrik Lundh on Effbot.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;import main
# main.pyc is created
</code></pre>

<p>When running a script python will <strong>not</strong> use the *.pyc file.
If you have some other reason you want your script pre-compiled you can use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/compileall.html" rel="nofollow"><code>compileall</code></a> module.</p>

<pre><code>python -m compileall .
</code></pre>

<h2>compileall Usage</h2>

<pre><code>python -m compileall --help
option --help not recognized
usage: python compileall.py [-l] [-f] [-q] [-d destdir] [-x regexp] [directory ...]
-l: don't recurse down
-f: force rebuild even if timestamps are up-to-date
-q: quiet operation
-d destdir: purported directory name for error messages
   if no directory arguments, -l sys.path is assumed
-x regexp: skip files matching the regular expression regexp
   the regexp is searched for in the full path of the file
</code></pre>

<p>Modules and scripts are treated the same. Importing is what triggers the output to be saved.</p></li>

<p>Using compileall does not solve this.
Scripts executed by python will not use the <code>*.pyc</code> unless explicitly called.  This has negative side effects, well stated by <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/136829/glenn-maynard">Glenn Maynard</a> in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5268017/why-does-python-compile-modules-but-not-the-script-being-run/5321733#5321733">his answer</a>.  </p>

<p>The example given of a CGI application should really be addressed by using a technique like <a href="http://www.fastcgi.com/drupal/" rel="nofollow">FastCGI</a>. If you want to eliminate the overhead of compiling your script you may want eliminate the overhead of starting up python too, not to mention database connection overhead.   </p>

<p>A light bootstrap script can be used or even <code>python -c "import script"</code>, but these have questionable style.</p></li>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/136829/glenn-maynard">Glenn Maynard</a> provided some inspiration to correct and improve this answer.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Nobody seems to want to say this, but I'm pretty sure the answer is simply: there's no solid reason for this behavior.</p>

<p>All of the reasons given so far are essentially incorrect:</p>

<ul>
<li>There's nothing special about the main file.  It's loaded as a module, and shows up in <code>sys.modules</code> like any other module.  Running a main script is nothing more than importing it with a module name of <code>__main__</code>.</li>
<li>There's no problem with failing to save .pyc files due to read-only directories; Python simply ignores it and moves on.</li>
<li>The benefit of caching a script is the same as that of caching any module: not wasting time recompiling the script every time it's run.  The docs acknowledge this explicitly ("Thus, the startup time of a script may be reduced ...").</li>
</ul>

<p>Another issue to note: if you run <code>python foo.py</code> and foo.pyc exists, it <em>will not be used</em>.  You have to <em>explicitly</em> say <code>python foo.pyc</code>.  That's a very bad idea: it means Python won't automatically recompile the .pyc file when it's out of sync (due to the .py file changing), so changes to the .py file won't be used until you manually recompile it.  It'll also fail outright with a RuntimeError if you upgrade Python and the .pyc file format is no longer compatible, which happens regularly.  Normally, this is all handled transparently.</p>

<p>You shouldn't need to move a script to a dummy module and set up a bootstrapping script to trick Python into caching it.  That's a hackish workaround.</p>

<p>The only possible (and very unconvincing) reason I can contrive is to avoid your home directory from being cluttered with a bunch of .pyc files.  (This isn't a real reason; if that was an actual concern, then .pyc files should be saved as dotfiles.)  It's certainly no reason not to even have an <em>option</em> to do this.</p>

<p>Python should definitely be able to cache the main module.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A program doesn’t run any faster when it is read from a .pyc or .pyo file than when it is read from a .py file; the only thing that’s faster about .pyc or .pyo files is the speed with which they are loaded.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is unnecessary to generate .pyc file for main script. Only the libraries which might be loaded many times should be compiled.</p>

<p><strong>Edited</strong>:</p>

<p>It seem you didn't get my point. First, knowing the whole idea of compiling into <code>.pyc</code> file is to make the same file executing faster at the second time. However, consider if Python did compile the script being run. The interpreter will write bytecode into a <code>.pyc</code> file at the first running, this takes time. So it will even run a bit slower. You might argue that it will run faster after. Well, it just a choice. Plus, as <code>this</code> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Explicit is better than implicit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If one wants a speedup by using <code>.pyc</code> file, one should compile it manually and run the <code>.pyc</code> file explicitly.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>To answer your question, reference to <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/modules.html#compiled-python-files" rel="nofollow">6.1.3. “Compiled” Python files</a> in Python official document.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When a script is run by giving its name on the command line, the bytecode for the script is never written to a .pyc or .pyo file. Thus, the startup time of a script may be reduced by moving most of its code to a module and having a small bootstrap script that imports that module. It is also possible to name a .pyc or .pyo file directly on the command line.</p>
</blockquote>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Because the script being run may be somewhere where it is inappropriate to generate .pyc files, such as <code>/usr/bin</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>The benefits are very low, considering that one might conceivably import hundreds of modules thanks to inheritance. With hundreds of modules, it wouldn't offer much of a size increase to cache the main file, and as stated before, there are many downsides such as a stuffed /usr directory or maybe even a stuffed /home directory if the user is running scripts from their home directory.</p>
