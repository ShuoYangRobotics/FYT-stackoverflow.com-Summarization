<h3>Question (ID-464864):</h3><h2>Python code to pick out all possible combinations from a list?</h2><p>I have a list with 15 numbers in, and I need to write some code that produces all 32,768 combinations of those numbers. </p>

<p>I've found <a href="http://desk.stinkpot.org:8080/tricks/index.php/2008/04/get-all-possible-combinations-of-a-lists-elements-in-python/" rel="nofollow">some code</a> (by googling) that apparently does what I'm looking for, but I found the code fairly opaque and am wary of using it. Plus I have a feeling there must be a more elegant solution.</p>

<p>The only thing that occurs to me would be to just loop through the decimal integers 1-32768 and convert those to binary, and use the binary representation as a filter to pick out the appropriate numbers. </p>

<p>Does anyone know of a better way? Using map(), maybe?</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Ben</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>itertools.combinations(iterable, r)
</code></pre>
  
  <p>Return r length subsequences of elements from
  the input iterable.</p>
  
  <p>Combinations are emitted in lexicographic sort order. So, if the
  input iterable is sorted, the
  combination tuples will be produced in
  sorted order.</p>

<p>Since 2.6, batteries are included!</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Alabaster's answer missed one aspect: Ben asked for ALL combinations... not just combinations of length "r".</p>

<p>So you'd either have to loop through all lengths "L":</p>

<pre><code>stuff = [1, 2, 3]
for L in range(0, len(stuff)+1):
  for subset in itertools.combinations(stuff, L):
    print(subset)
</code></pre>

<p>Or -- if you want to get snazzy (or bend the brain of whoever reads your code after you) -- you can generate the chain of "combinations()" generators, and iterate through that:</p>

<pre><code>from itertools import chain, combinations
def all_subsets(ss):
  return chain(*map(lambda x: combinations(ss, x), range(0, len(ss)+1)))

for subset in all_subsets(stuff):
  print(subset)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If you don't have access to Python 2.6 you might find it in a <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/190465/" rel="nofollow">recipe from the Python Cookbook</a>. I'm sure there are some more recipes for this topic.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Here's a lazy one-liner, also using itertools:</p>

<pre><code>def combinations(iter):
    return ( set(compress(iter,mask)) for mask in product(*[[0,1]]*len(iter)) )
</code></pre>

<p>Main idea behind this answer: there are 2^N combinations -- same as the number of binary strings of length N. For each binary string, you pick all elements corresponding to a "1".</p>

<pre><code>abc
 |
 V
000 -&gt; 
001 -&gt;   c
010 -&gt;  b
011 -&gt;  bc
100 -&gt; a
101 -&gt; a c
110 -&gt; ab
111 -&gt; abc
</code></pre>

<p>You may wish to redefine as <code>list(iter)</code> so <code>len</code> will work on generators.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Demo</strong></p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; list(combinations(range(4)))
[set(), {3}, {2}, {2, 3}, {1}, {1, 3}, {1, 2}, {1, 2, 3}, {0}, {0, 3}, {0, 2}, {0, 2, 3}, {0, 1}, {0, 1, 3}, {0, 1, 2}, {0, 1, 2, 3}]

&gt;&gt;&gt; list(combinations('abcd'))
[set(), {'d'}, {'c'}, {'c', 'd'}, {'b'}, {'b', 'd'}, {'c', 'b'}, {'c', 'b', 'd'}, {'a'}, {'a', 'd'}, {'a', 'c'}, {'a', 'c', 'd'}, {'a', 'b'}, {'a', 'b', 'd'}, {'a', 'c', 'b'}, {'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'}]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I agree with Dan H that Ben indeed asked for <strong>all</strong> combinations. <code>itertools.combinations()</code> does not give all combinations.</p>

<p>Another issue is, if the input iterable is big, it is perhaps better to return a generator instead of everything in a list:</p>

<pre><code>iterable = range(10)
for s in xrange(len(iterable)+1):
  for comb in itertools.combinations(iterable, s):
    yield comb
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Using list comprehension:</p>

<pre><code>def selfCombine( list2Combine, length ):
    listCombined = str( ['list2Combine[i' + str( i ) + ']' for i in range( length )] ).replace( "'", '' ) \
                     + 'for i0 in range(len( list2Combine ) )'
    if length &gt; 1:
        listCombined += str( [' for i' + str( i ) + ' in range( i' + str( i - 1 ) + ', len( list2Combine ) )' for i in range( 1, length )] )\
            .replace( "', '", ' ' )\
            .replace( "['", '' )\
            .replace( "']", '' )

    listCombined = '[' + listCombined + ']'
    listCombined = eval( listCombined )

    return listCombined

list2Combine = ['A', 'B', 'C']
listCombined = selfCombine( list2Combine, 2 )
</code></pre>

<p>Output would be:</p>

<pre><code>['A', 'A']
['A', 'B']
['A', 'C']
['B', 'B']
['B', 'C']
['C', 'C']
</code></pre>
