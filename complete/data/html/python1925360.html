<h3>Question (ID-1925360):</h3><h2>Rules Engine in C or Python</h2><p>I am looking for a rules engine in C or Python, but if you know a rules engine that is implemented in another language I would be glad to know about it.</p>

<p>The engine will be used as way to automate a house, like turning the light off when somebody leaves a room etc. So no "office" rules there (aka do you rules in Excel or such).</p>

<p>I have looked into Jess and Drools which are in Java and do a perfect job. I would like to know of others and possibly using less memory than Java does.
I have heard of RuleCore in Python but couldn't really find any documentation on it (version 1.0 is available at SourceForge but it looks like they are selling v. 2.0).</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: By rules engine (inference engine), I mean an implementation of RETE or equivalent.</p>

<p>PS: I had left a comment to S.Lott's answer about Pyke. I have posted a separate answer as per his suggestion and also to let other readers readily know that the rules engine mentioned in this answer could be a probable choice if they are searching for one.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You could look at <a href="http://clipsrules.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">CLIPS</a> as already suggested or, if you want to pay money or need it <a href="http://www.pst.com/rete2.htm" rel="nofollow">Rete2</a>.  I've used CLIPS in the past on Unix and sucessfully embedded it into other applications.  </p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><a href="http://github.com/mattup/ruleby" rel="nofollow">ruleby</a> is a rule engine in written in ruby. It was subject of a presentation at rubyhoedown 2008: <a href="http://rubyhoedown2008.confreaks.com/10-joe-kutner-ruleby-the-rule-engine-for-ruby.html" rel="nofollow">ruleby-the-rule-engine-for-ruby</a></p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Pychinko has been around for a while. I've never used it in production, but investigated it for possible production application a while back. It looks like it has pretty good features and a decent community of users.</p>

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Here is a list of 13 open source rules engines in java, Drools is possibly the best of these. <a href="http://java-sources.org/open-source/rule-engines" rel="nofollow">http://java-sources.org/open-source/rule-engines</a></p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Rulecore is indeed written partly in Python. But it does not really matter. You as an user would not see any of these implementation details anyway.</p>

<p>The rules are purely declarative and defined using XML. The XML is sent into ruleCore CEP Server as events using a web services or JMS or other protocols.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I know ruleCore has some parts written in Python. But the API uses XML and ActiveMQ or WebServices so it is on a higher abstraction level.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>In effect, Python <em>is</em> a rules engine.</p>

<p>"The engine will be used as way to automate a house, like turning the light off when somebody leaves a room etc."</p>

<p>You need sensors and controllers.  You write your "rules" as ordinary Python objects.</p>

<p>Your main "program" collects events from your sensors and sends events to your controllers.  </p>

<p>If you can read from your sensors via ordinary USB, that's even better.  The marine industry uses a couple of closely related standards like NMEA 0183 and NMEA 2000 for specifying the traffic on the bus from sensor to controller.</p>

<p>You don't need Yet Another Rules Language.  You have Python.</p>
