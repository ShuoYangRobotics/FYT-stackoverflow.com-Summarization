<h3>Question (ID-704834):</h3><h2>Does anyone know about workflow frameworks/libraries in Python?</h2><p>I'm searching for a workflow library/framework for Python. I'm astonished that there I cannot find anything which is simple and not attached to Zope/Plone. </p>

<p>Does anyone know of an open-source, simple workflow library/framework. It's preferred to support Django, but not required.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Unfortunately it seems like most/all of the projects listed here are no longer active.  Here's a new project which is currently ongoing:</p>

<p><a href="http://packages.python.org/django-workflows/overview.html" rel="nofollow">http://packages.python.org/django-workflows/overview.html</a></p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Another workflow project that I saw recently was repoze.workflow, which is a state-machine based workflow engine which was inspired by plone, but is a clean re-implementation. </p>

<p><a href="http://svn.repoze.org/repoze.workflow/trunk/docs/index.rst" rel="nofollow">http://svn.repoze.org/repoze.workflow/trunk/docs/index.rst</a></p>

<p>Not exactly sure how production ready it really is, but I do know some people that are using it. </p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I used hurry.workflow: <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hurry.workflow" rel="nofollow">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hurry.workflow</a>
It has plenty of features but unfortunately has some zope dependecies so it may be not applicable for other frameworks.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>ntoll's <a href="http://github.com/ntoll/workflow" rel="nofollow">workflow</a> for django is alpha, but is actively developed</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I know there is an openerp, but it's not workflow.....</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Besides GoFlow (linked in Oli's answer) the only other Django workflow I know of is part of the <a href="http://www.pinaxproject.com" rel="nofollow">Pinax</a> project.</p>

<p>More generally for Python based workflows there is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/spiff-workflow/" rel="nofollow">spiff workflow</a> and Dave Kuhlman's <a href="http://www.rexx.com/~dkuhlman/workflow%5Fhowto.html" rel="nofollow">Workflow and REST How-to</a> that could probably be converted from Quixote to Django.</p>
