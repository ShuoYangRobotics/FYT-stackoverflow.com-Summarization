<h3>Question (ID-1760879):</h3><h2>Printing 5 numbers in a row</h2><p>I have to write a program to print the numbers 1 to 50, but with 5 numbers in a row, like:</p>

<p>1,2,3,4,5<br>
6,7,8,9,10 </p>

<p>like that till 50 without using lists</p>

<pre><code>for i in range(2,51):
   if i%5==0:
      print i
</code></pre>

<p>this is giving me 5,10,15,20</p>

<p>Please help me </p>

<ul>
<li>The first parameter for the range() function is incorrect. It must be 1 not 2.  The start index included, the ending one is excluded.  This is btw a very good practice to avoid bugs.</li>
<li>With the modulo operator you found a way of detecting every 5 values;  you could use this to print a line when that happens.  You then would be left with having to find a way to not output a line when you output one value at at time; look in the <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/simple%5Fstmts.html#the-print-statement" rel="nofollow">python documentation</a> for way to make the print() function do this.   (attention, things have changed in the area of print with Python 3.0, but you seem to be using a 2.x version given your example)</li>
<li>An alternative approach is to use the 3rd argument of the range() function, to step though the sequence, in increments of 5).  Such a range would give you 1, 6, 11, 16 etc. in sequence, and you can use this number as the first of each line, and simple addition for the following ones.</li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You can start almost like you did (except you need to start from 1 - that 2 is <strong>really</strong> weird!-):</p>

<pre><code>for i in range(1,51):
   if i % 5 == 0:
      print i
</code></pre>

<p>but then you need to segue into an <code>else</code> clause for that <code>if</code>, because you <strong>do</strong> want to print something even when <code>i</code> is not a multiple of 5 -- just something <em>different</em> from the simple <code>print i</code> you're already doing when <code>i</code> <strong>is</strong> a multiple of 5...:</p>

<pre><code>   else:
      print i, ',',
</code></pre>

<p>As other answers already said, the trailing comma means "no newline yet"!-)  ((It's plainer and more sensible in Python 3.whatever, but you're clearly using Python 2.something, and in those versions this is what you need to do)).</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I've never used Python, but this should be close if not right.</p>

<pre><code>for i in range(1,51):
      print i;
      print ",";
      if (i%5==0)
         { print "\n";}
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Also, remember that using <code>print</code> will cause a new line to start. Unless as noted above a comma is used afterwards.</p>

<p>You can collect values using a string for printing out later.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Some Hints</p>

<ul>
<li><p>To print 1 to 50, you need to pass n+1 for eg, 1 to 51 in <strong>range</strong> function, its <code>(i=1;i&lt;51,i++)</code> in C alike syntax</p></li>
<li><p>print comma if you want between every digits</p></li>
<li><p>to print line break for every 5, you can just use current <code>if i%5==0:</code> but print blank line, instead of <code>i</code></p></li>
<li><p>To concatenate num + string "," you can use <code> `i`  or str(i) , you can do like `i` +","</code></p></li>
<li><p>If you dont need comma in the end, you could do like i%5 print "," else print "\n" => </p>

<p><code>(i%5 and "," or "\n")</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>print i</code> will print i line by line, and <code>print i,</code> will print in the same line </p></li>
</ul>

<p>just my 2 cents</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><pre><code>for i in range(1,51):
    if i%5 == 0:
        print i
    else:
        print i, ",",
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><pre><code>(there used to be python code here)
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: My apologies, didn't realize this was homework. I reeeally need to check tags before answering. Here's an explanation of what needs to happen.</p>

<p>Obviously you know that you're trying to output consecutive numbers from 1 to 50, so you'll need a counter. You've figured out that it'll require a <code>range()</code> call, but it needs to be from 1 to 51, not from 2 to 50.</p>

<p>The reason the <code>range()</code> call needs to be from 1 to 51 is this: it will start the variable <code>i</code> at <code>1</code>, then check to see if it has reached its goal (<code>51</code>) before looping. If the goal is reached (meaning if <code>i == 51</code>) it will quit the loop without executing the loop's code. So rather than go from 1 to 50, you go from 1 to 51 so that we don't skip the 50th iteration.</p>

<p>Next, you're going to want to have the numbers appear on-screen. But using python's <code>print</code> command prints each number on a new line! That's obviously not what you want. So you're going to have to create a buffer string to append each number to until you're ready to print the line. You can call it 'output' or whatever.</p>

<p>Personally, I like to clear the buffer BEFORE the <code>for</code> loop just to be sure no residual memory traces find their way into the output. Call me paranoid. So I write <code>output = ""</code> on a line before the loop.</p>

<p>Now you've got a buffer string, all you need to do is follow a logical flow:</p>

<ol>
<li>Add <code>i</code> to the buffer <code>output</code>.</li>
<li>If <code>i</code> is a multiple of 5, print the buffer <code>output</code> and reset it back to an empty string. (We do this so that we can start the buffer for the next line.)</li>
<li>If <code>i</code> is NOT a multiple of 5, add a comma to the <code>output</code> buffer, so that the next number added will be after the comma.</li>
<li>Continue our loop.</li>
</ol>

<p>These steps should be pretty simple to figure out. Step 2 you've already seen before... To check if a number is a multiple of another number, simply use <code>%</code>. If <code>A % B == 0</code> then A is a multiple of B.</p>

<p>This should be a pretty straightforward explanation for how to solve this problem. Hope it helps.</p>

<p>And sorry for ruining your learning experience by posting the answer! Now you'll understand why the answer works.</p>
