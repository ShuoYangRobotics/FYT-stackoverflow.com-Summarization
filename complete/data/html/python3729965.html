<h3>Question (ID-3729965):</h3><h2>How to update $PATH</h2><p>I am writing a python/pygtk application that is adding some custom scripts (bash) in a certain folder in $HOME (eg. <code>~/.custom_scripts</code>). </p>

<p>I want to make that folder available in <code>$PATH</code>. So every time the python app is adding the script, that script could be instantly available when the user is opening a terminal (eg. gnome-terminal). </p>

<p>Where do you suggest to "inject" that $PATH dependecy ? <code>.bashrc</code>, <code>/etc/profile.d</code>, etc. ?
What advantages / disadvantages I might encounter ?</p>

<p>For example if i add a script to export the new path in /etc/profile.d, the path is not being updated until I re-login.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Your installer won't be able to change the path of the current shell (unless it's being run via <code>source</code>, which would be...odd.)</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>For scripts that go in the $HOME directory you'd typically use $HOME/bin folder instead which is (usually) on the path.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>/etc/profile.d would add it to every user's path</p>

<p>~/.bashrc would just be your own</p>

<p>you can always do "$ source ~/.bashrc" to re-read the config files.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Edit: I misread the original question, so this snippet is only useful for modifying <code>PATH</code>, but not for persisting it...</p>

<p>This can all be done using the <code>os</code> module:</p>

<pre><code>import os
USER_HOME = os.path.expanduser('~')
os.environ['PATH'] += ":" + os.path.join(USER_HOME, '.custom_scripts')
</code></pre>

<p>This appends <code>:~/.custom_scripts</code> to the end of the <code>$PATH</code>, since <code>PATH</code> must always be colon-delimited.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>~/.bashrc is read every time gnome-terminal is opened, (assuming the user has SHELL set to /bin/bash).</p>

<p>Be sure to check os.environ['PATH'] to see if the directory has already been added, so that the script doesn't add it more than once.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You shouldn't. It's the user choice whether he wants that in the <code>PATH</code>, in what cases and how to achieve that. What you can do is inform the user about the directory where your scripts reside and suggest putting it to the <code>PATH</code>.</p>

<p>Or maybe you're asking from the user's perspective?</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Why don't you establish the appropriate <code>PATH</code> upon the first call to your module (i.e. in your module's <code>__init__.py</code>):</p>

<pre><code># this is your module's __init__.py
import sys
eggs = ['/path/to/egg/1.egg', '/path/to/egg/2.egg']
for egg in eggs:
    sys.path.append(egg)
</code></pre>
