<h3>Question (ID-3325343):</h3><h2>Why Python is not full object-oriented?</h2><p>I want to know , why Python is not full object-oriented ? (e.g : Does not support private , public , protected) .
What`s the advantage and disadvantage of this ? By this expressions , Python is suitable for what applications (Desktop , Scientific , Web or ...) ?</p>

<p>Thanks .</p>

<p>There's an agreement that underscores mean private elements and you should not use them. Unless you know what you're doing and you really want to.</p>

<p>The link also mentions another way to put it in case of Perl:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"a Perl module would prefer that you
  stayed out of its living room<br>
  because you weren't invited, not
  because it has a shotgun."</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Python doesn't support strong <em>encapsulation</em>, which is only one of many features associated with the term "object-oriented".</p>

<p>The answer is simply philosophy. Guido doesn't like hiding things, and many in the Python community agree with him.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I believe Python is more of a very practical, pragmatic language. </p>

<p>Concepts which offer value to the developer are put in, without too much consideration about theological concepts like "proper OO design" and stuff. It's a language for people who have real work to do.</p>

<p>I think Python is suitable for all kinds of environments, though Desktop is a bit difficult due to the lack of a single framework. For all applications it's handy to use a framework,
like NumPy for computational stuff, Twisted or Django for web stuff, and WxWidgets or other for Desktop stuff.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Access modifiers (public, private, protected, etc) are not required for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-based_programming" rel="nofollow">class-based programming</a>. They are just a feature, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance" rel="nofollow">multiple inheritance</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>it does support public and private. </p>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I think Python is designed to be a hybrid.  You can write in object oriented or functional styles.  </p>

<p>The hallmarks of object-orientation are abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.  Which of these are missing from Python?</p>

<p>Object-orientation is a continuum.  We might say that Smalltalk is the purest of the pure, and all others occupy different places on the scale.  </p>

<p>No one can say what the value of being 100% pure is.  It's possible to write very good object-oriented code in languages that aren't Smalltalk, Python included.</p>

<p>Python is useful in all those areas: scientific (NumPy), web (Django), and desktop.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>What exactly is full object oriented?  Alan Kay said "Actually I made up the term "object-oriented", and I can tell you I did not have C++ in mind.".  Admittedly, he probably did not have python in mind either, but it is worth noting that Smalltalk also protects classes by convention, no mandate.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>A language is said to Full Objective Oriented if it has no primitive data tipes. Each data type we need to construct.</p>
