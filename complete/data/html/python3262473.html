<h3>Question (ID-3262473):</h3><h2>Check Pending AJAX requests or HTTP GET/POST request</h2><p>How do i check if the page has pending AJAX or HTTP GET/POST requests? I use javascript and/or python for this checking. </p>

<p>what i wanted to do is execute a script if a page has finished all requests. onload doesn't work for me, if you used firebugs net panel, you would know. onload fires when the page is loaded but there is a possibility that there are still pending request hanging around somewhere.</p>

<p>thank you in advance.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I see you mention you are using Prototype.js. You can track active requests with Prototype by checking the <code>Ajax.activeRequestCount</code> value. You could check this using setTimeout or setInterval to make sure that any requests triggered on page load have completed (if that's what you're looking to do)</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You would need to keep track of each XMLHttpRequest and monitor whether it completes or the asynchronous callback is executed.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Assuming you are using prototype.js you could keep track with a counter of all your request objects</p>

<pre><code>var ACTIVE_REQUESTS = 0; // GLOBAL

ACTIVE_REQUESTS++
new Ajax.Request('/your/url', {
  onSuccess: function(response) {
    ACTIVE_REQUESTS--;
    // Handle the response content...
  }
}));

console.log("there are " + ACTIVE_REQUESTS + " open AJAX requests pending");
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>i think that will not solve the problem. Even if you got the status of an AJAX request, that's just one request, another http/ajax request might follow. in between those events, the status for an ajax request is completed so the script i would want to execute will be executed w/c is not what i really wanted. what i wanted is to check if there are no pending request.</p>

<p>i thought something like this:</p>

<pre><code>while(1){
    if( window.status == 'Done'){
        executeFunction();
        break;
    } else {
        //set time out for a few milliseconds
    }
}
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>figured it out. thanks for the effort guys.
just plain and simple javascript.</p>

<pre><code>interValRef = 0;

interValRef = setInterval("checkState();",100)

function checkState(){
    if(document.readyState == 'complete'){
        clearInterval(interValRef);
        myFunc();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I think you want to know if the HTML is fully loaded. In this case you can use the <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/api/document/observe" rel="nofollow">dom:loaded</a> event. Here is an example on how to use it with prototype (but there must be a variant for other JS frameworks):</p>

<pre><code>document.observe("dom:loaded", function() {
  // do whatever you want to do
});
</code></pre>

<p>This event will fire as soon as the DOM tree is loaded. So even before all the images or external data (including iframe) are loaded.</p>
