<h3>Question (ID-4738908):</h3><h2>Python: Generalizing solution</h2><p>I'm currently using singpath.com to practice on my python, but I face an issue with a problem:</p>

<p>A number, a, is a power of b if it is divisible by b and a/b is a power of b. 
Write a function called is_power that takes parameters a and b and returns True if a is a power of b.</p>

<pre><code>def is_power(a,b):
    c = a/b
    if (((a%b) == 0) and ((c%b) == 0)):
        return True
    else:
        return False 
</code></pre>

<p>Above is my solution but the system prompt me to generalize my solution.
Can anyone tell me whats wrong with my solution?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The reason reason why your original code does not work is the following: You just check <code>(c%b) == 0)</code> aka <code>(a/b) is divisible by b</code>, which is much weaker than the <code>a/b is a power of b</code> part of the definition.</p>

<p>When you want to solve a problem such as this you should always start with the trivial cases. In this case there are two such cases: <code>is_power(x,x)</code> and <code>is_power(1,x)</code> - in both the answer is <code>True</code>, because <code>x**1==x</code> and <code>x**0==1</code>. </p>

<p>Once you have these cases covered you just need to write down the rest of the definition. Write code for <code>(a is divisible by b) and (a/b is a power of b)</code> and put it all together.</p>

<p>The final function will look like this: </p>

<pre><code>def is_power(a,b):
    if &lt;trivial case 1&gt; or &lt;trivial case 2&gt;:
        return True
    # its a recursive definition so you have to use `is_power` here
    return &lt;a is divisible by b&gt; and &lt;a/b is a power of b&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The only question left is how to answer <code>&lt;a/b is a power of b&gt;</code>. The easiest way to do this is using the function <code>is_power</code> itself - this is called recursion.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You are only checking the first two powers: a divides b and a/b divides b. It could be that a = b ** 3 or b ** 4 (or b ** n in general), so the actual solution will have to involve recursion or a loop.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I wouldn't say to generalize it.  I would say to correct it as it's incorrect.  Using your solution is_power(12,2) returns True as does is_power(18,3).</p>

<p>I think that the reason that the system says to generalize it is that it's probably working correctly for some of their test cases, but not others.  It's likely that the test cases for which it is working are coincidentally those for which it would work if it were hard-coded in a certain way (only checking powers of 2, for example).</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You're checking whether <code>a/b</code> is <em>divisible by</em> <code>b</code> (in the expression <code>(c%b) == 0</code>), rather than whether <code>a/b</code> is a <em>power of</em> <code>b</code>. <strong>Hint:</strong> What function would you call to see whether something is a power of <code>b</code>?</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>To understand recursion, you need first to understand recursion.</p>

<pre><code> def is_power(a, b):
     if a &lt; b: # 3 is never a power of 10, right?
         return False # prevent recursion
     if a == b:  # a is always a**1, right?
         return True  # prevent recursion
     else:
         return is_power(a / b, b) # recursion!
</code></pre>

<p>Note that for integers <code>a / b</code> will give you rounding errors. Make sure you pass floats.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I don't think you have the right implementation. Based on the problem, the <code>is_power</code> function should look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>def is_power(a,b):
    if a%b == 0 and is_power(float(a)/float(b), b):
        return True
    else:
        return False
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>You can cheat and use log.</p>

<pre><code>import math

def is_power(a, b):
    return math.log(a, b) % 1 == 0
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>def is_power(a,b):
    if(a==b):
        return True
    if(a%b==0):
        if is_power(a/b,b):
            return True
        else:
            return False
    else:
        return False</p>
