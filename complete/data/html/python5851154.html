<h3>Question (ID-5851154):</h3><h2>best algorithm for finding distance for all pairs where edges' weight is 1</h2><p>As the title said, I'm trying to implement an algorithm that finds out the distances between all pairs of nodes in given graph. But there is more: (Things that might help you)</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The graph is unweighted. <em>Meaning that all the edges can be considered as having weight of 1</em>.</strong></li>
<li><code>|E| &lt;= 4*|V|</code></li>
<li>The graph is pretty big (at most ~144 depth)</li>
<li>The graph is directed</li>
<li>There might be cycles </li>
<li>I'm writing my code in python (please if you reference algorithms, code would be nice too :))</li>
</ul>

<p>I know about <strong>Johnson's algorithm</strong>, <strong>Floyd-Warshal</strong>, and <strong>Dijkstra</strong> for all pairs. But these algorithms are good when the graph has weights.</p>

<p>I was wondering if there is a better algorithm for my case, because those algorithms are intended for weighted graphs.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-10):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I can't point you to a better algorithm straight away, but I would argue that there is space for improvement because in unweighted graphs, you gain an additional attribute which does not hold for weighted graphs, namely:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For any edge directly connecting A to C, you know for sure that there is no shorter path via a third node B.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With this in mind, you should be able to simplify Dijkstra's Algorithm: As you may know, it works with three sets of nodes: </p>

<ol>
<li>Those of which the definitive shortest path is known, </li>
<li>those of which a preliminary distance has been calculated and </li>
<li>those which have not yet been explored. </li>
</ol>

<p>When following an edge <code>e</code> from <code>A</code> (1.) to <code>C</code> (3.), original Dijkstra would move node <code>C</code> from (3.) to (2.). Since the above attribute holds in all your graphs, you can however add it directly to the set (1.), which is more efficient.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum</strong>: Here's the essential observation: The procedure outlined above is basically a BFS (breadth first search), i.e. you can find the distance from some fixed node <code>v</code> to any other node in <code>O(|V| + |E|)</code>.</p>

<p>You did not mention in your original question that the graph was basically a grid with some holes in it. This is an even stronger requirement, and I am sure you can exploit it. Doing a quick search for "grid graph shortest path" yields <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/net.3230070404/abstract" rel="nofollow">this paper</a> which promises <code>O(sqrt(n))</code> in the best case. As the problem you specify is fairly well-structured, I'm almost sure there are several more papers which you might want to look into.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Run a breadth-first search from each node. Total time: O(|V| |E|) = O(|V|<sup>2</sup>), which is optimal.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I don't how you can measure the distance if all edges are unweighted but you want to look at Edmond's Blossom V algorithm. You want to look at <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/221251-maximum-cardinality-matching-in-general-graphs" rel="nofollow">http://code.activestate.com/recipes/221251-maximum-cardinality-matching-in-general-graphs</a>. Here is something similar: <a href="http://wilanw.blogspot.com/2009/09/maximumminimum-weighted-bipartite.html" rel="nofollow">http://wilanw.blogspot.com/2009/09/maximumminimum-weighted-bipartite.html</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>How about the Warshall algorithm, with the following very simple implementation: </p>

<pre><code>def warshall(graph):
  n = graph.numNodes+1
  W = [ [graph.w(i,j) for j in graph.V()] for i in graph.V() ]
  for k in range(1,n): 
    for i in range(1,n):
      for j in range(1,n):
        W[i][j] = min( W[i][j] , W[i][k]+W[k][j] )
  return W
</code></pre>

<p>where </p>

<ul>
<li><code>V()</code> yield all vertices of the graph</li>
<li><code>w(i,j)</code> yields the wight of edge (i,j) - in your case all 1 or 0 </li>
<li><code>numNodes</code> yield the number of the graph's nodes.</li>
</ul>

<p>complexity is, however O(n^3)</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I would refer you to the following paper: "Sub-cubic Cost Algorithms for the All Pairs Shortest Path Problem" by Tadao Takaoka. There a sequential algorithm with sub-cubic complexity for graphs with unit weight (actually max edge weight = O(n ^ 0.624)) is available.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I suggest you give networkx a try, it seemed to work fine with 1000 nodes.</p>

<p>the following link contains Shortest path algorithms for unweighted graphs:</p>

<p><a href="http://networkx.lanl.gov/reference/algorithms.shortest_paths.html" rel="nofollow">http://networkx.lanl.gov/reference/algorithms.shortest_paths.html</a></p>

<p>Here is an example with 10 nodes:</p>

<pre><code>from random import random
import networkx as nx
G=nx.DiGraph()
N=10
#make a random graph
for i in range(N):
    for j in range(i):
        if 4*random()&lt;1:
            G.add_edge(i,j)

print G.adj
print nx.all_pairs_shortest_path(G)
print nx.all_pairs_shortest_path_length(G)

#output:

<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>In the Python Graph project:</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/python-graph/" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/python-graph/</a></p>

<p>You can find my implementation of the A* algorithm with support for hinting-heuristics. This is particularly suitable for obstacle avoidance in 2 dimensions as the hinting algorithm need not be anything more than pythogras' theorem. </p>

<p>I think this would do everything you nedd. If you dont like the graph abstractions used by this project you can re-use the algorithm. It's written in a very generic way.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>I'm assuming the graph is dynamic; otherwise, there's no reason not to use Floyd-Warshall to precompute all-pairs distances on such a small graph ;)</p>

<p>Suppose you have a grid of points (x, y) with 0 &lt;= x &lt;= n, 0 &lt;= y &lt;= n. Upon removing an edge E: (i, j) &lt;-> (i+1, j), you partition row j into sets A = { (0, j), ..., (i, j) }, B = { (i+1, j), ..., (n, j) } such that points a in A, b in B are <strong>forced</strong> to route around E - so you need only recompute distance for all pairs (a, b) in (A, B).</p>

<p>Maybe you can precompute Floyd-Warshall, then, and use something like this to cut recomputation down to O(n^2) (or so) per graph modification...</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>After taking a quick flip through <a href="http://www.algorist.com/" rel="nofollow">the Algorithm Design Manual</a>, here is what Skiena has to say (from Chapter 15.4 - Shortest Path). Unsurprisingly, it comes to the same conclusion many of you have already provided, but also provides some other insights</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The primary algorithm for finding the shortest path is Djikstra's algorithm ...</p>
  
  <p><em>Is your graph weighted, or unweighted?</em> If your graph is unweighted, a simple breadth-first search starting from the source vertex will find the shortest path to all other vertices in linear time...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He goes on to mention the other cases you may be interested in (e.g. what if the input is a set of geometric obstacles? Do you need the shortest path between all pairs of points?) but in these cases he also concludes the same as you have: Djikstra's algorithm or the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.</p>

<p>Depending on your use, you may also want to look into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_closure" rel="nofollow">Transitive Closures</a> which deal with reachability, and use similar algorithms. </p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><pre><code>def from_vertex(v, E):
    active = [v]
    step = 0
    result = {v:0}
    while active:
        step += 1
        new_active = []
        for x in active:
            for nh in E[x]:
                if nh not in result:
                    new_active.append(nh)
                    result[nh] = step + 1
        active = new_active
    return result
</code></pre>

<p>Basically you do a flood-fill from each vertex and you get as result the minimum distance of any other reachable vertex from that one.</p>
