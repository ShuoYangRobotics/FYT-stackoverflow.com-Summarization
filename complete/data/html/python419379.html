<h3>Question (ID-419379):</h3><h2>How to maintain lists and dictionaries between function calls in Python?</h2><p>Its urgent...</p>

<p>I have a function. Inside that I'm maintainfing a dictionary of values.
I want that dictionary to be maintained between different function calls</p>

<p>Suppose the dic is :</p>

<pre><code>a = {'a':1,'b':2,'c':3}
</code></pre>

<p>At first call,say,I changed a[a] to 100
Dict becomes <code>a = {'a':100,'b':2,'c':3}</code></p>

<p>At another call,i changed a[b] to 200
I want that dic to be <code>a = {'a':100,'b':200,'c':3}</code></p>

<p>But in my code a[a] doesn't remain 100.It changes to initial value 1.</p>

<p>I need an answer ASAP....I m already late...Please help me friends...</p>

<pre><code>class MyFunction( object ):
    def __init__( self ):
        self.rememberThis= dict()
    def __call__( self, arg1, arg2 ):
        # do something
        rememberThis['a'] = arg1
        return someValue

myFunction= MyFunction()
</code></pre>

<p>From then on, use myFunction as a simple function. You can access the <code>rememberThis</code> dictionary using <code>myFunction.rememberThis</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You could use a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/279561/what-is-the-python-equivalent-of-static-variables-inside-a-function">static variable</a>:</p>

<pre><code>def foo(k, v):
  foo.a[k] = v
foo.a = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}

foo('a', 100)
foo('b', 200)

print foo.a
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If 'a' is being created inside the function. It is going out of scope. Simply create it outside the function(and before the function is called). By doing this the list/hash will not be deleted after the program leaves the function.</p>

<pre><code>a = {'a':1,'b':2,'c':3}

# call you funciton here
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You can 'cheat' using Python's behavior for default arguments.  Default arguments are only evaluated once; they get reused for every call of the function.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def testFunction(persistent_dict={'a': 0}):
...     persistent_dict['a'] += 1
...     print persistent_dict['a']
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; testFunction()
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; testFunction()
2
</code></pre>

<p>This isn't the most elegant solution; if someone calls the function and passes in a parameter it will override the default, which probably isn't what you want.</p>

<p>If you just want a quick and dirty way to get the results, that will work.  If you're doing something more complicated it might be better to factor it out into a class like S. Lott mentioned.</p>

<p>EDIT: Renamed the dictionary so it wouldn't hide the builtin <code>dict</code> as per the comment below.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Rather than forcing globals on the code base (that can be the decision of the caller) I prefer the idea of keeping the state related to an instance of the function.  A class is good for this but doesn't communicate well what you are trying to accomplish and can be a bit verbose.  Taking advantage of closures is, in my opinion, a lot cleaner.</p>

<pre><code>def function_the_world_sees():
    a = {'a':1,'b':2,'c':3}

    def actual_function(arg0, arg1):
        a[arg0] = arg1
        return a

    return actual_function
stateful_function = function_the_world_sees()

stateful_function("b", 100)    
stateful_function("b", 200)
</code></pre>

<p>The main caution to keep in mind is that when you make assignments in "actual_function", they occur within "actual_function".  This means you can't reassign a to a different variable.  The work arounds I use are to put all of my variables I plan to reassign into either into a single element list per variable or a dictionary.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>This question doesn't have an elegant answer, in my opinion.  The options are callable objects, default values, and attribute hacks.  Callable objects are the right answer, but they bring in a lot of structure for what would be a single "static" declaration in another language. Default values are a minor change to the code, but it's kludgy and can be confusing to a new python programmer looking at your code. I don't like them because their existence isn't hidden from anyone who might be looking at your API.</p>

<p>I generally go with an attribute hack.  My preferred method is:</p>

<pre><code>def myfunct():
    if not hasattr(myfunct, 'state'): myfunct.state = list()
    # access myfunct.state in the body however you want
</code></pre>

<p>This keeps the declaration of the state in the first line of the function where it belongs, as well as keeping myfunct as a function.  The downside is you do the attribute check every time you call the function.  This is almost certainly not going to be a bottleneck in most code.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Personally, I like the idea of the global statement.  It doesn't introduce a global variable but states that a local identifier actually refers to one in the global namespace.</p>

<pre><code>d = dict()
l = list()
def foo(bar, baz):
    global d
    global l
    l.append(bar, baz)
    d[bar] = baz
</code></pre>

<p>In python 3.0 there is also a "nonlocal" statement.</p>
