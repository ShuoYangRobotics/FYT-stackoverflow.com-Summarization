<h3>Question (ID-3813681):</h3><h2>Checking to see if 3 points are on the same line</h2><p>I want to know a piece of a code which can actually tell me if 3 points in a 2D space are on the same line or not. A pseudocode is also sufficient but Python is better.
Thanks </p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>This is C++, but you can adapt it to python:</p>

<pre><code>bool collinear(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2, int x3, int y3) {
  return (y1 - y2) * (x1 - x3) == (y1 - y3) * (x1 - x2);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, we are checking that the slopes between point 1 and point 2 and point 1 and point 3 match. Slope is change in y divided by change in x, so we have:</p>

<pre><code>y1 - y2     y1 - y3
-------  =  --------
x1 - x2     x1 - x3
</code></pre>

<p>Cross multiplying gives <code>(y1 - y2) * (x1 - x3) == (y1 - y3) * (x1 - x2)</code>;</p>

<p>Note, if you are using doubles, you can check against an epsilon:</p>

<pre><code>bool collinear(double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2, double x3, double y3) {
  return fabs((y1 - y2) * (x1 - x3) - (y1 - y3) * (x1 - x2)) &lt;= 1e-9;
}
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You can check if the area of the ABC triangle is 0:</p>

<pre><code>[ Ax * (By - Cy) + Bx * (Cy - Ay) + Cx * (Ay - By) ] / 2
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, you don't actually need to divide by 2.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Read <a href="http://www.mathsisfun.com/equation_of_line.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>, and use it to find the equation of a line through the first two points. Follow the instructions to find <code>m</code> and <code>b</code>. Then for your third point, calculate <code>mx + b - y</code>. If the result is zero, the third point is on the same line as the first two.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Rule 1: <strong>In any linear 2d space, two points are always on the same line.</strong></p>

<p>Take 2 points and build an equation that represents a line through them.
Then check if the third point is also on that line. </p>

<p>Good luck.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p><code>y - y0 = a(x-x0)</code> (1) while <code>a = (y1 - y0)/(x1 - x0)</code> and <code>A(x0, y0)</code> <code>B(x1, y1)</code> <code>C(x2, y2)</code>. See whether <code>C</code> statisfies (1). You just replace the appropriate values.</p>
