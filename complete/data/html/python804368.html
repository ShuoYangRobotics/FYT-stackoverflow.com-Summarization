<h3>Question (ID-804368):</h3><h2>Blogging System which runs on the Google App Engine</h2><p>What is a cool blogging engine for GAE? I really like Wordpress, but PHP isn't 
available on the GAE.</p>

<p>Which blogging systems do you use on GAE?</p>

<p>Which experiences you have made with it?</p>

<p>For example Bloog is mentioned there:</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Take a look at <a href="http://github.com/Arachnid/bloggart" rel="nofollow">bloggart</a>, written mainly by fellow StackOverflow user <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/12030/nick-johnson">Nick Johnson</a>. His blog includes a great series that <a href="http://blog.notdot.net/2009/10/Writing-a-blog-system-on-App-Engine" rel="nofollow">explains its implementation from the very beginning</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/cpedialog/" rel="nofollow">cpedia</a> has an excellent demo not just of the front end but of all the features in the admin itself.</p>

<p>In my experience GAE is a joy to play with, especially if you have any experience with Django or MVP (<em>or MVC as django folks prefer to say</em>).</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Maybe see <a href="http://brizzled.clapper.org/id/77" rel="nofollow">http://brizzled.clapper.org/id/77</a> (no personal experience using it, myself).</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>There is a python framework <a href="http://www.web2py.com/" rel="nofollow">web2py</a> and there are some <a href="http://mdp.cti.depaul.edu/appliances" rel="nofollow">appliances</a> (plugins) for this  framework. Although I have not tried that, you may be interested in application <a href="http://mdp.cti.depaul.edu/appliances/default/show/36" rel="nofollow">Wordpress Clone</a>. </p>

<p>Installing web2py is very easy (just unzip and copy files) and web2py is guaranteed to run on GAE.</p>

<p>Anyway, this solution is for anyone who want to play with framework (and python) if you just need to blog, I recommend to go for some already installed system (wordpressn is ok, if you like it) at <a href="http://wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">http://wordpress.com/</a> or anywhere else.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>There's <a href="http://bitbucket.org/ianb/pickywiki/" rel="nofollow">PickyWiki (a CMS) by Ian Bicking</a> (haven't used it myself)</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>you'll find some blog engines for GAE (mostly GAE/P) in application section of <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/gaeasaframework/applications" rel="nofollow">Google App Engine as a Framework project</a></p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>I have just set up Wordpress 2.7.1 with modifications running on Quercus (PHP in Java) by way of the instructions and install <a href="http://www.caucho.com/articles/Quercus_on_GAE.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>. It's incredibly impressive, but not ready for prime-time. For example, the entire admin interface doesn't work. I don't recommend it (yet).</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>I just <a href="http://blog.dantup.com/2009/12/from-net-to-python-on-app-engine.html" rel="nofollow">wrote my own</a> because I couldn't find one I liked (either too simple, or too bloated), but recently I noticed Nick Johnson of the App Engine Team had <a href="http://blog.notdot.net/2009/10/Writing-a-blog-system-on-App-Engine" rel="nofollow">written one too</a>. I'd look at using his if I had to do it again!</p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>Have you tried Votay? You can download the source code at <a href="http://github.com/andrewarrow/votay" rel="nofollow">http://github.com/andrewarrow/votay</a></p>
<br /><b>#10</b><br /><p>There is a hack to get <a href="http://www.webdigi.co.uk/blog/2009/run-php-on-the-google-app-engine/" rel="nofollow">PHP running on GAE</a></p>
<br /><b>#11</b><br /><p>There is also Django based <a href="http://www.hoydaa.com/products/blog/" rel="nofollow">Hoydaa Blog</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#12</b><br /><p>I created blog software which runs well on google app engine.  I use it to power my own blog.  Take a look: </p>
