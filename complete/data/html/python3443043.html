<h3>Question (ID-3443043):</h3><h2>Why does python use two underscores for certain things?</h2><p>I'm fairly new to actual programming languages, and Python is my first one. I know my way around Linux a bit, enough to get a summer job with it (I'm still in high school), and on the job, I have a lot of free time which I'm using to learn Python.</p>

<p>One thing's been getting me though. What exactly is different in Python when you have expressions such as</p>

<pre><code>x.__add__(y) &lt;==&gt; x+y
x.__getattribute__('foo') &lt;==&gt; x.foo
</code></pre>

<p>I know what methods do and stuff, and I get what they do, but my question is: How are those double underscore methods above different from their simpler looking equivalents?</p>

<p>P.S., I don't mind being lectured on programming history, in fact, I find it very useful to know :) If these are mainly historical aspects of Python, feel free to start rambling.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>When you start a method with two underscores (and no trailing underscores), Python's <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/expressions.html#atom-identifiers" rel="nofollow">name mangling</a> rules are applied. This is a way to loosely simulate the <code>private</code> keyword from other OO languages such as C++ and Java. (Even so, the method is still technically not private in the way that Java and C++ methods are private, but it is "harder to get at" from outside the instance.)</p>

<p>Methods with two leading and two trailing underscores are considered to be "built-in" methods, that is, they're used by the interpreter and are generally the concrete implementations of overloaded operators or other built-in functionality.</p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Well, power for the programmer is good, so there should be a way to customize behaviour. Like operator overloading (<code>__add__</code>, <code>__div__</code>, <code>__ge__</code>, ...), attribute access (<code>__getattribute__</code>, <code>__getattr__</code> (those two are differnt), <code>__delattr__</code>, ...) etc. In many cases, like operators, the usual syntax maps 1:1 to the respective method. In other cases, there is a special procedure which at some point involves calling the respective method - for example, <code>__getattr__</code> is only called if the object doesn't have the requested attribute and <code>__getattribute__</code> is not implemented or raised AttributeError. And some of them are really advanced topics that get you deeeeep into the object system's guts and are rarely needed. So no need to learn them all, just consult the reference when you need/want to know. Speaking of reference, <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names" rel="nofollow">here it is</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>They are used to specify that the Python interpreter should use them in specific situations.</p>

<p>E.g., the <code>__add__</code> function allows the <code>+</code> operator to work for custom classes. Otherwise you will get some sort of not defined error when attempting to add. </p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Here is the creator of Python <a href="http://python-history.blogspot.com/2009/02/adding-support-for-user-defined-classes.html" rel="nofollow">explaining it</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... rather than devising a new syntax for
  special kinds of class methods (such
  as initializers and destructors), I
  decided that these features could be
  handled by simply requiring the user
  to implement methods with special
  names such as _<em>init</em>_, _<em>del</em>_, and
  so forth. This naming convention was
  taken from C where identifiers
  starting with underscores are reserved
  by the compiler and often have special
  meaning (e.g., macros such as
  _<em>FILE</em>_ in the C preprocessor).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I also used this technique to allow
  user classes to redefine the behavior
  of Python's operators. As previously
  noted, Python is implemented in C and
  uses tables of function pointers to
  implement various capabilities of
  built-in objects (e.g., “get
  attribute”, “add” and “call”). To
  allow these capabilities to be defined
  in user-defined classes, I mapped the
  various function pointers to special
  method names such as _<em>getattr</em>_,
  _<em>add</em>_, and _<em>call</em>_. There is a
  direct correspondence between these
  names and the tables of function
  pointers one has to define when
  implementing new Python objects in C.</p>
</blockquote>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>From an historical perspective, leading underscores have often been used as a method for indicating to the programmer that the names are to be considered internal to the package/module/library that defines them.  In languages which do not provide good support for private namespaces, using underscores is a convention to emulate that.  In Python, when you define a method named '&#95;&#95;foo&#95;&#95;' the maintenance programmer knows from the name that something special is going on which is not happening with a method named 'foo'.  If Python had choosen to use 'add' as the internal method to overload '+', then you could never have a class with a method 'add' without causing much confusion.  The underscores serve as a cue that some magic will happen. </p>
