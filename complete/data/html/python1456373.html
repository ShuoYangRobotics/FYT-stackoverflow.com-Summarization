<h3>Question (ID-1456373):</h3><h2>Two way / reverse map [python]</h2><p>I'm doing this switchboard thing in python where I need to keep track of who's talking to whom, so if Alice --> Bob, then that implies that Bob --> Alice. </p>

<p>Yes, I could populate two hash maps, but I'm wondering if anyone has an idea to do it with one. </p>

<p>Or suggest another data structure. </p>

<p>EDIT: There are no multiple conversations. Lets say this is for a customer service call center, so when Alice dials into the switchboard, she's only going to talk to Bob. His replies also go only to her. </p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>In your special case you can store both in one dictionary:</p>

<pre><code>relation = {}
relation['Alice'] = 'Bob'
relation['Bob'] = 'Alice'
</code></pre>

<p>Since what you are describing is a symmetric relationship. <code>A -&gt; B =&gt; B -&gt; A</code></p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You have two separate issues.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You have a "Conversation" object.  It refers to two Persons.  Since a Person can have multiple conversations, you have a many-to-many relationship.</p></li>
<li><p>You have a Map from Person to a list of Conversations.  A Conversion will have a pair of Persons.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Do something like this</p>

<pre><code>from collections import defaultdict
switchboard= defaultdict( list )

x = Conversation( "Alice", "Bob" )
y = Conversation( "Alice", "Charlie" )

for c in ( x, y ):
    switchboard[c.p1].append( c )
    switchboard[c.p2].append( c )
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Two hash maps is actually probably the fastest-performing solution assuming you can spare the memory.  I would wrap those in a single class - the burden on the programmer is in ensuring that two the hash maps sync up correctly.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>No, there is really no way to do this without creating two dictionaries. How would it be possible to implement this with just one dictionary while continuing to offer comparable performance?</p>

<p>You are better off creating a custom type that encapsulates two dictionaries and exposes the functionality you want.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I would just populate a second hash, with</p>

<pre><code>reverse_map = dict((reversed(item) for item in forward_map.items()))
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Here is a <a href="http://www.aminus.net/geniusql/browser/trunk/geniusql/objects.py#L32" rel="nofollow">simple bijective Dictionary implementation</a>, although I don't know if it will meet your performance requirements.</p>

<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>The kjbuckets C extension module provides a "graph" data structure which I believe gives you what you want.</p>
