<h3>Question (ID-2133571):</h3><h2>Most Pythonic way to concatenate strings</h2><p>Given this harmless little list:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; lst = ['o','s','s','a','m','a']
</code></pre>

<p>My goal is to pythonically concatenate the little devils using one of the following ways:</p>

<p>A. plain ol' string function to get the job done, short, no imports</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; ''.join(lst)
'ossama'
</code></pre>

<p>B. lambda, lambda, lambda </p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, lst)
'ossama'
</code></pre>

<p>C. globalization (do nothing, import everything)</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import functools, operator
&gt;&gt;&gt; functools.reduce(operator.add, lst)
'ossama'
</code></pre>

<p>Please suggest other pythonic ways to achieve this magnanimous task.</p>

<p>Please rank (pythonic level) and rate solutions giving concise explanations.</p>

<p>In this case, is the most pythonic solution the best coding solution?</p>

<p>the only pythonic way:</p>

<ul>
<li>clear (that what all the big boys do and what they expect to see),</li>
<li>simple (no additional imports needed, stable across all versions),</li>
<li>fast (written in C) and </li>
<li>concise (on an empty string join elements of iterable!).</li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Have a look at Guido's <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/essays/list2str/" rel="nofollow">essay</a> on python optimization, it covers converting lists of numbers to strings. Unless you have a <em>good</em> reason to do otherwise, use the <code>join</code> example.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Of course it's <code>join</code>. How do I know?  Let's do it in a really stupid way:<br>
If the problem was only adding 2 strings, you'd most likely use <code>str1 + str2</code>. What does it take to get that to the next level? Instinctively, for most (I think), will be to use <code>sum</code>. Let's see how that goes:</p>

<pre><code>In [1]: example = ['a', 'b', 'c']
In [2]: sum(example, '')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
&lt;ipython console&gt; in &lt;module&gt;()
TypeError: sum() can't sum strings [use ''.join(seq) instead]
</code></pre>

<p>Wow! Python simply told me what to use! :)</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I myself use the "join" way, but from python 2.6 there is a base type that is little used: <strong>bytearray</strong>.</p>

<p>Bytearrays can be incredible useful -- for string containing texts, since the best thing is to have then in unicode, the "join" way is the way to go -- but if you are dealing with binary data instead, bytearrays can be both more pythonic and more efficient:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; lst = ['o','s','s','a','m','a']
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = bytearray(lst)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
bytearray(b'ossama')
&gt;&gt;&gt; print a
ossama
</code></pre>

<p>it is a built in data type: no imports needed - just use then -- and you can use a bytearray isntead of a list to start with - so they should be more efficinet than the "join", since there is no data copying to get the string representation for a bytearray.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Great answer from SilenGhost BUT, just a few words about the presented <code>reduce</code> "alternative"</p>

<p>Unless you've got a very very <strong>VERY</strong> good reason to concatenate strings using <code>+</code> or <code>operator.add</code> (the most frequent one, that you've got few, fixed number of strings), you should use always <code>join</code>.</p>

<p>Just because each <code>+</code> generates a new string which is the concatenation of two strings, unless join that only generates one final string. So, imagine you've got 3 strings:</p>

<pre><code>A + B + C
--&gt;
D = A + B
final = D + C
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, doesn't seems not much, but you've got to reserve memory for D. Also, due python use of strings, generating a new, intermediate, string, it's somehow expensive...</p>

<p>Now, with 5 strings</p>

<pre><code>A + B + C + D + E
--&gt;
F = A + B
G = F + C
H = G + D
final = H + E
</code></pre>

<p>Assuming the best scenario (if we do (A+B) + (C+D) + E, we'll end having three intermediate strings at the same time on memory), that's generating 3 intermediate strings... You've got to generate a new python object, reserve memory space, release the memory a few times... Also the overhead of calling a Python function (that is not small)</p>

<p>Now think of it with 200 strings. We'll end up with a ridiculous big number of intermediate strings, each of one consuming combining quite a lot time on being a complete list over python, and calling a lot of <code>operator.add</code> functions, each with its overhead... Even if you use <code>reduce</code> functions, it won't help. It's a problem that has to be managed with a different approach: <code>join</code>, which only generates <strong>ONE</strong> complete python string, the final one and calls ONE python function.</p>

<p>(Of course, <code>join</code>, or other similar, specialized function for arrays)</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Here's the least Pythonic way:</p>

<pre><code>out = ""
for x in range(len(lst)):
  for y in range(len(lst)):
    if x + y == len(lst)-1:
        out = lst[y] + out
</code></pre>
