<h3>Question (ID-538666):</h3><h2>Python format timedelta to string</h2><p>I'm a python newbie (2 weeks) and I'm having trouble formatting a datetime.timedelta object.</p>

<p>Here's what I'm trying to do.  I have a list of objects and one of the members of the class of the object is a timedelta object that shows the duration of an event.  I would like to display that duration in the format of hours:minutes.</p>

<p>I have tried a variety of methods for doing this and I'm having difficulty.  My current approach is to add methods to the class for my objects that return hours and minutes.  I can get the hours by dividing the timedelta.seconds by 3600 and rounding it. I'm having trouble with getting the remainder seconds and converting that to minutes.</p>

<p>By the way, I'm using Google AppEngine with DJango Templates for presentation.</p>

<p>If anyone can help or knows of a better way to resolve this, I would be very happy.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>As you know, you can get the seconds from a timedelta object by accessing the <code>.seconds</code> attribute.</p>

<p>You can convert that to hours and remainder by using a combination of modulo and subtraction:</p>

<pre><code># arbitrary number of seconds
s = 13420
# hours
hours = s // 3600 
# remaining seconds
s = s - (hours * 3600)
# minutes
minutes = s // 60
# remaining seconds
seconds = s - (minutes * 60)
# total time
print '%s:%s:%s' % (hours, minutes, seconds)
# result: 3:43:40
</code></pre>

<p>However, python provides the builtin function divmod() which allows us to simplify this code:</p>

<pre><code>s = 13420
hours, remainder = divmod(s, 3600)
minutes, seconds = divmod(remainder, 60)
print '%s:%s:%s' % (hours, minutes, seconds)
# result: 3:43:40
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You can just convert the timedelta to a string with str(). Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>import datetime
start = datetime.datetime(2009,2,10,14,00)
end = datetime.datetime(2009,2,10,16,00)
delta = end-start
print str(delta)
# prints 2:00:00
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; str(datetime.timedelta(hours=10.56))
10:33:36

&gt;&gt;&gt; td = datetime.timedelta(hours=10.505) # any timedelta object
&gt;&gt;&gt; ':'.join(str(td).split(':')[:2])
10:30
</code></pre>

<p>Passing the <code>timedelta</code> object to the <code>str()</code> function calls the same formatting code used if we simply type <code>print td</code>. Since you don't want the seconds, we can split the string by colons (3 parts) and put it back together with only the first 2 parts.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>My <code>datetime.timedelta</code> objects went greater than a day. So here is a further problem.  All the discussion above assumes less than a day.  A <code>timedelta</code> is actually a tuple of days, seconds and microseconds.  The above discussion should use <code>td.seconds</code> as joe did, but if you have days it is NOT included in the seconds value. </p>

<p>I am getting a span of time between 2 datetimes and printing days and hours.</p>

<pre><code>span = currentdt - previousdt
print '%d,%d\n' % (span.days,span.seconds/3600)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Following Joe's example value above, I'd use the modulus arithmetic operator, thusly:</p>

<pre><code>td = datetime.timedelta(hours=10.56)
td_str = "%d:%d" % (td.seconds/3600, td.seconds%3600/60)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that integer division in Python rounds down by default; if you want to be more explicit, use math.floor() or math.ceil() as appropriate.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Thanks everyone for your help.  I took many of your ideas and put them together, let me know what you think.</p>

<p>I added two methods to the class like this:</p>

<pre><code>def hours(self):
    retval = ""
    if self.totalTime:
        hoursfloat = self.totalTime.seconds / 3600
        retval = round(hoursfloat)
    return retval

def minutes(self):
    retval = ""
    if self.totalTime:
        minutesfloat = self.totalTime.seconds / 60
        hoursAsMinutes = self.hours() * 60
        retval = round(minutesfloat - hoursAsMinutes)
    return retval
</code></pre>

<p>In my django I used this (sum is the object and it is in a dictionary):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;td&gt;{{ sum.0 }}&lt;/td&gt;    
&lt;td&gt;{{ sum.1.hours|stringformat:"d" }}:{{ sum.1.minutes|stringformat:"#02.0d" }}&lt;/td&gt;
</code></pre>
