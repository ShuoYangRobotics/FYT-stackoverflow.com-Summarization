<h3>Question (ID-5249348):</h3><h2>creating a reverse method for a python list from scratch</h2><p>I want to create a reverse method for a list.  I know there already is such a method built into python but I want to try it from scratch.  Here's what I have and it seems to make sense to me but it just returns the list in the same order.  My understanding was that lists are mutable and I could just reassign values in the loop.</p>

<pre><code>def reverse(data_list):
    length = len(data_list)
    s = length

    for item in data_list:
        s = s - 1
        data_list[s] = item
    return data_list

>> reverse([1,2,3,4,5])
[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
</pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>an easy way in python (without using the reverse function) is using the [] access operator with negative values such as (print and create a new list in reverse order):</p>

<pre><code>x = [1, 2 ,3, 4, 5]
newx = []
for i in range(1, len(x)+1):
  newx.append(x[-i])
  print x[-i]
</code></pre>

<p>the function would be:</p>

<pre><code>def reverse(list)
  newlist = []
  for i in range(1, len(list)+1):
    newlist.append(list[-1])
  return newlist
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>By the time you are half-way through the list, you have swapped all the items; as you continue through the second half, you are swapping them all back to their original locations again.</p>

<p>Instead try</p>

<pre><code>def reverse(lst):
    i = 0            # first item
    j = len(lst)-1   # last item
    while i&lt;j:
        lst[i],lst[j] = lst[j],lst[i]
        i += 1
        j -= 1
    return lst
</code></pre>

<p>This can be used in two ways:</p>

<pre><code>a = [1,2,3,4,5]
reverse(a)        # in-place
print a           # -&gt; [5,4,3,2,1]

b = reverse(a[:]) # return the result of reversing a copy of a
print a           # -&gt; [5,4,3,2,1]
print b           # -&gt; [1,2,3,4,5]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I do not get the same list when I try to run your code. But I also do not get a reversed list because the list is moving forward through the list state which is changing from end back. I think the way you are looking to do it is:</p>

<pre><code>def reverse(data_set):
  length = len(data_set)

  for i in range(0, length / 2):
    length = length - 1
    hold = data_set[i]
    data_set[i] = data_set[length]
    data_set[length] = hold
  return data_set
</code></pre>

<p>here we actually reverse in half the iterations and we memoize the value of the index we are changing so we can set the "reversal" in the same step.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You are changing the list that you iterate on it (data_list) because of that it's not working , try like this:</p>

<pre><code>def reverse(data_list):
    length = len(data_list)
    s = length

    new_list = [None]*length

    for item in data_list:
        s = s - 1
        new_list[s] = item
    return new_list
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Something like this should work:</p>

<pre><code>mylist = [1,2,3,4,5]
def reverse(orig_list):
    data_list = orig_list[:]
    length = len(data_list)
    for i in xrange(0, length/2):
        tmp = data_list[length-i-1]
        data_list[length-i-1] = data_list[i]
        data_list[i] = tmp
    return data_list

reverse(mylist)
mylist
</code></pre>
