<h3>Question (ID-2369440):</h3><h2>How to delete all blank lines in the file with the help of python?</h2><p>For example, we have some file like that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>first line<br>
  second line
  <br><br>
  third line</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And in result we have to get:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>first line<br>
  second line<br>
  third line</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Use ONLY python</p>

<pre><code>with open('myfile','rw') as file:
    for line in file:
        if line.strip():
            file.write(line)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><pre><code>import fileinput
for line in fileinput.FileInput("file",inplace=1):
    if line.rstrip():
        print line
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s = """first line
... second line
... 
... third line
... """
&gt;&gt;&gt; print '\n'.join([i for i in s.split('\n') if len(i) &gt; 0])
first line
second line
third line
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I know you asked about Python, but your comment about Win and Linux indicates that you're after cross-platform-ness, and Perl is at least as cross-platform as Python.  You can do this easily with one line of Perl on the command line, no scripts necessary: <code>perl -ne 'print if /\S/' foo.txt</code></p>

<p>(I love Python and prefer it to Perl 99% of the time, but sometimes I really wish I could do command-line scripts with it as you can with the -e switch to Perl!)</p>

<p>That said, the following Python script should work.  If you expect to do this often or for big files, it should be optimized with compiling the regular expressions too.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python
import re
file = open('foo.txt', 'r')
for line in file.readlines():
    if re.search('\S', line): print line,
file.close()
</code></pre>

<p>There are lots of ways to do this, that's just one :)</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><pre><code>import sys
with open("file.txt") as f:
    for line in f:
        if not line.isspace():
            sys.stdout.write(line)
</code></pre>

<p>Another way is</p>

<pre><code>with open("file.txt") as f:
    print "".join(line for line in f if not line.isspace())
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Have you tried something like the program below?</p>

<pre><code>for line in open(filename):
    if len(line) &gt; 1 or line != '\n':
        print(line, end='')
</code></pre>
