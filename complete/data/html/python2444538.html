<h3>Question (ID-2444538):</h3><h2>Go to a specific line in Python?</h2><p>I want to go to line 34 in a .txt file and read it. How would you do that in Python?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Use Python Standard Library's <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/linecache.html?highlight=linecache#module-linecache" rel="nofollow">linecache</a> module:</p>

<pre><code>line = linecache.getline(thefilename, 33)
</code></pre>

<p>should do exactly what you want.  You don't even need to open the file -- <code>linecache</code> does it all for you!</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You could just read all the lines and index the line your after.</p>

<pre><code>line = open('filename').readlines()[33]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>A solution that will not read more of the file than necessary is
    from itertools import islice</p>

<pre><code>line_number = 34

with open(filename) as f:
    # Adjust index since Python/islice indexes from 0 and the first 
    # line of a file is line 1
    line = next(islice(f, line_number - 1, line_number))
</code></pre>

<p>A very straightforward solution is</p>

<pre><code>line_number = 34

with open(filename) as f:
    f.readlines()[line_number - 1]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>There's two ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>Read the file, line by line, stop when you've gotten to the line you want</li>
<li>Use <code>f.readlines()</code> which will read the entire file into memory, and return it as a list of lines, then extract the 34th item from that list.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Solution 1</h2>

<p>Benefit: You only keep, in memory, the specific line you want.</p>

<p>code:</p>

<pre><code>for i in xrange(34):
    line = f.readline();
# when you get here, line will be the 34th line, or None, if there wasn't
# enough lines in the file
</code></pre>

<h2>Solution 2</h2>

<p>Benefit: Much less code<br>
Downside: Reads the entire file into memory<br>
Problem: Will crash if less than 34 elements are present in the list, needs error handling</p>

<pre><code>line = f.readlines()[33]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><pre><code>for linenum,line in enumerate(open("file")):
    if linenum+1==34: print line.rstrip()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>This code will open the file, read the line and print it.</p>

<pre><code># Open and read file into buffer
f = open(file,"r")
lines = f.readlines()

# If we need to read line 33, and assign it to some variable
x = lines[33]
print(x)
</code></pre>
