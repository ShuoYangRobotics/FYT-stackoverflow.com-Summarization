<h3>Question (ID-2049247):</h3><h2>Atomic file write operations (cross platform)</h2><p>How do I build up an atomic file write operation? The file is to be written by a Java service and read by python scripts.<br>
For the record, reads are far greater than writes. But the write happens in batches and tend to be long. The file size amounts to mega bytes.  </p>

<p><em>Right now my approach is:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Write file contents to a temp file in
same directory</li>
<li>Delete old file</li>
<li>Rename temp file to old filename.</li>
</ul>

<p>Is this the right approach? How can avoid conditions where the old file is deleted but the new filename is yet to be renamed?   </p>

<p>Do these programming languages (<em>python and java</em>) offer constructs to lock and avoid this situation? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>AFAIK no.  </p>

<p>And the reason is that for such an atomic operation to be possible, there has to be OS support in the form of a transactional file system.  And none of the mainstream operating system offer a transactional file system.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> - I'm wrong for POSIX-compliant systems at least.  The POSIX <code>rename</code> syscall performs an atomic replace if a file with the target name already exists ... as pointed out by @janneb.  That should be sufficient to do the OP's operation atomically.</p>

<p>However, the fact remains that the Java <code>File.renameTo()</code> method is explicitly <em>not</em> guaranteed to be atomic, so it does not provide a cross-platform solution to the OP's problem.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>At least on POSIX platforms, leave out step 3 (delete old file). In POSIX, rename within a filesystem is guaranteed to be atomic, and renaming on top of an existing file replaces it atomically.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>It's a classic producer/consumer problem. You should be able to solve this by using file renaming, which is atomic on POSIX systems.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Try <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/nio/channels/FileLock.html" rel="nofollow">Java FileLock API</a></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You could try and use an extra file to act as a lock, but I'm not sure if that will work out ok. (It would force you to create lock-checking and retry logic at both sides, java and python)</p>

<p>Another solution might be to not create files at all, maybe you could make your java process listen on a port and serve data from there rather than from a file?</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Have the python scripts request permission from the service.  While the service is writing it would place a lock on the file.  If the lock exists, the service would reject the python request.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>In Linux, Solaris, Unix this is easy. Just use <code>rename</code>() from your program or <code>mv</code>. The files need to be on the same filesystem.</p>

<p>On Windows, this is possible if you can control both programs. <code>LockFileEx</code>. For reads, open a <code>shared lock</code> on the lockfile. For writes, open an <code>exclusive lock</code> on the lockfile. Locking is weird in Windows, so I recommend using a separate <em>lock file</em> for this.</p>
