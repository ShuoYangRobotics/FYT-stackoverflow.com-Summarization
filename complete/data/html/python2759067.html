<h3>Question (ID-2759067):</h3><h2>Rename Files in Python</h2><p>Im trying to rename some files in a directory using python.  I've looked around the forums here, and because i'm a noob, I cant adapt what I need from what is out there.  </p>

<p>Say I have a file called <code>CHEESE_CHEESE_TYPE.***</code> and want to remove "Cheese_" so my resulting filename would be "CHEESE_TYPE"</p>

<p>Im trying to use the <code>os.path.split</code> but it's not working properly.</p>

<p>I have also considered using string manipulations, but have not been successful with that either.</p>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks.</p>

<pre><code>$ ls
cheese_cheese_type.bar  cheese_cheese_type.foo
$ python
&gt;&gt;&gt; import os
&gt;&gt;&gt; for filename in os.listdir("."):
...  if filename.startswith("cheese_"):
...    os.rename(filename, filename[7:])
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
$ ls
cheese_type.bar  cheese_type.foo

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Here's a script based on your newest comment.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
from os import rename, listdir

badprefix = "cheese_"
fnames = listdir('.')

for fname in fnames:
    if fname.startswith(badprefix*2):
        rename(fname, fname.replace(badprefix, '', 1))
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>It seems that your problem is more in determining the new file name rather than the rename itself (for which you could use the os.rename method).</p>

<p>It is not clear from your question what the pattern is that you want to be renaming. There is nothing wrong with string manipulation. A regular expression may be what you need here.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><h2>What about this :</h2>

<pre><code>import re
p = re.compile(r'_')
p.split(filename, 1) #where filename is CHEESE_CHEESE_TYPE.***
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Try this:</p>

<pre><code>import os
import shutil

for file in os.listdir(dirpath):
    newfile = dirpath + "/" + file.split("_",1)[1]
    shutil.move(dirpath"/"+file,newfile)
</code></pre>

<p>I'm assuming you don't want to remove the file extension, but you can just do the same split with periods.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Assuming you are already in the directory, and that the "first 8 characters" from your comment hold true always.  (Although "CHEESE_" is 7 characters... ? If so, change the 8 below to 7)</p>

<pre><code>from glob import glob
from os import rename
for fname in glob('*.prj'):
    rename(fname, fname[8:])
</code></pre>
