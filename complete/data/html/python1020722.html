<h3>Question (ID-1020722):</h3><h2>is there a better way to convert a list to a dictionary in python with keys but no values?</h2><p>I was sure that there would be a one liner to convert a list to a dictionary where the items in the list were keys and the dictionary had no values.   </p>

<p>The only way I could find to do it was argued against </p>

<p>"Using list comprehensions when the result is ignored is misleading and inefficient. A for loop is better"</p>

<pre><code>myList=['a','b','c','d']
myDict={}
x=[myDict.update({item:None}) for item in myList]

&gt;&gt;&gt; myDict
{'a': None, 'c': None, 'b': None, 'd': None}
</code></pre>

<p>It works but I thought someone might have some insight as to a better way to do this.  </p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Use <code>dict.fromkeys</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; my_list = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; dict.fromkeys(my_list)
{1: None, 2: None, 3: None}
</code></pre>

<p>Values default to <code>None</code>, but you can specify them as an optional argument:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; my_list = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; dict.fromkeys(my_list, 0)
{1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0}
</code></pre>

<p>From the docs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a.fromkeys(seq[, value]) Creates a new
  dictionary with keys from seq and
  values set to value.</p>
  
  <p>dict.fromkeys is a class method that
  returns a new dictionary. value
  defaults to None. New in version 2.3.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You could use a <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset" rel="nofollow">set</a> instead of a dict:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; myList=['a','b','c','d']
&gt;&gt;&gt; set(myList)
set(['a', 'c', 'b', 'd'])
</code></pre>

<p>This is better if you never need to store values, and are just storing an unordered collection of unique items.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>To answer the original questioner's performance worries (for lookups in <code>dict</code> vs <code>set</code>), somewhat surprisingly, <code>dict</code> lookups <em>can</em> be minutely faster (in Python 2.5.1 on my rather slow laptop) assuming for example that half the lookups fail and half succeed. Here's how one goes about finding out:</p>

<pre><code>$ python -mtimeit -s'k=dict.fromkeys(range(99))' '5 in k and 112 in k'
1000000 loops, best of 3: 0.236 usec per loop
$ python -mtimeit -s'k=set(range(99))' '5 in k and 112 in k'
1000000 loops, best of 3: 0.265 usec per loop
</code></pre>

<p>doing each check several times to verify they're repeatable. So, if those 30 nanoseconds or less on a slow laptop are in an absolutely crucial bottleneck, it may be worth going for the obscure <code>dict.fromkeys</code> solution rather than the simple, obvious, readable, and clearly correct <code>set</code> (unusual -- almost invariably in Python the simple and direct solution has performance advantages too).</p>

<p>Of course, one needs to check with one's own Python version, machine, data, and ratio of successful vs failing tests, <strong>and</strong> confirm with extremely accurate profiling that shaving 30 nanoseconds (or whatever) off this lookup will make an important difference.</p>

<p>Fortunately, in the vast majority of cases, this will prove totally unnecessary... but since programmers <strong>will</strong> obsess about meaningless micro-optimizations <em>anyway</em>, no matter how many times they're told about their irrelevance, the <code>timeit</code> module is right there in the standard library to make those mostly-meaningless micro-benchmarks easy as pie anyway!-)</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>And here's a fairly wrong and inefficient way to do it using map:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; d = dict()
&gt;&gt;&gt; map (lambda x: d.__setitem__(x, None), [1,2,3])
[None, None, None]
&gt;&gt;&gt; d
{1: None, 2: None, 3: None}
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You can use a list comprehension:</p>

<pre><code>my_list = ['a','b','c','d']
my_dict = dict([(ele, None) for ele in my_list])
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Maybe you can use itertools:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;import itertools
&gt;&gt;&gt;my_list = ['a','b','c','d']
&gt;&gt;&gt;d = {}
&gt;&gt;&gt;for x in itertools.imap(d.setdefault, my_list): pass
&gt;&gt;&gt;print d
{'a': None, 'c': None, 'b': None, 'd': None}
</code></pre>

<p>For huge lists, maybe this is very good :P</p>
