<h3>Question (ID-5871041):</h3><h2>Python list and type error</h2><p>I've code this code in Python:</p>

<pre><code>if type(data).__name__=='list':
                print type(data).__name__
                print ",".join(data)
</code></pre>

<p>And it give me this error:</p>

<pre><code>    print ",".join(data)
exceptions.TypeError: sequence item 0: expected string, list found
</code></pre>

<p>How's that possible?!?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for anyhelp.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p><code>str.join()</code> can only join a sequence of strings.  Obviously your list contains an item that itself is a list again.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if you really need to check for the type of an object, a better way to do it is</p>

<pre><code>if isinstance(data, list):
    ...
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The first element of <code>data</code> is a <code>list</code>. It must be a string in order for <code>str.join()</code> to work as shown. In fact, all elements must.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Don't explicitly check for types. If you do need to, use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#isinstance" rel="nofollow">isinstance</a>. </p>

<p>The error is appearing because of the contents of <code>data</code> rather than its type. It needs to be a list of strings for the <code>str.join</code> method to work on it. </p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The first element of your list is also a list, not a string.</p>

<p>Also you don't have to do <code>type(data).__name__=='list'</code> - just <code>type(data) is list</code></p>

<p>Even better - just check with <code>isinstance</code> since you don't really care about a specific type in most cases.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p><code>join</code> expects an iterable of <em>strings</em>. What seems to happen in your case is that the first element of your list is another list. This is what's causing the error.</p>

<p>As an aside, the <code>if type(data).__name__=='list': ...</code> is as un-Pythonic as code gets.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You appear to have a list of lists. Try:</p>

<pre><code>",".join(str(x) for x in data)
</code></pre>
