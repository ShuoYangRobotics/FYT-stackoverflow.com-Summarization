<h3>Question (ID-1033519):</h3><h2>Monkeypatching a method call in Python</h2><p>How do I put off attribute access in Python?</p>

<p>Let's assume we have:</p>

<pre><code>    def foo():
        ...

    class Bar:
        ...

    bar = Bar()
</code></pre>

<p>Is it possible to implement Bar so that any time <code>bar</code> is accessed, a value returned by the callback <code>foo()</code> would be provided?</p>

<p><code>bar</code> name already exists in the context. That's why it's access semantics should be preserved (it cannot be a callable, turning bar into a property of a class, using <code>SomeClass.bar</code> instead of <code>bar</code> also won't work). I need to keep everything as-is, but change the program so that <code>bar</code> would refer to on-the-fly generated data by <code>foo()</code>.</p>

<p><strong>UPD</strong>: Thanks all for your answers, from which it seems impossible to do this type of thing in Python. I'm gonna find a workaround.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I guess you want to link some attribute "data" to foo:</p>

<pre><code>class Bar:
    data = property(lambda self: foo())


bar = Bar()
bar.data # calls foo()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You're basically asking for a way to hijack a variable (how would you reassign it?) in the module namespace, which is not possible in Python.</p>

<p>You'll have to use attribute accessors of a class if you want the described behavior:</p>

<pre><code>class MyClass(object):
    def __getattr__(self, attr):
        if attr == 'bar':
            print 'getting bar... call the foo()!'
        else:
            return object.__getattribute__(self, attr)

    def __setattr__(self, attr, val):
        if attr == 'bar':
            print 'bar was set to', val
        else:
            object.__setattr__(self, attr, val)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>"any time bar is accessed"... What kinds of accesses are your callers going to be making? (E.g. are they doing "1+bar", are they doing "bar[5:]", are they doing "bar.func()", etc).   Will they call the Bar() constructor each time?</p>

<p>Right now, your question is so fuzzy and general that I think it's impossible.  But if you're a bit more specific then we might be able to help.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Is this what you're looking for?</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def foo(): print('foo() was called');
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; class Bar:
...     pass;
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; bar = Bar();
&gt;&gt;&gt; bar.data = foo;
&gt;&gt;&gt; bar.data()
foo() was called
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Thanks for the clarification!</p>

<p>This just can't work! A variable is a variable in most languages, not a function-call. You can do much in Python, but you just can't do that.</p>

<p>The reason is, that you have always some intrinsic language rules. One rule in Python is, that variables are variables. When you read a variable (not modifying it or anything else) you can rely, that it will be the same in the next code-line.</p>

<p>Monkeypatching it to be a function call would just change this rule.</p>

<p>What you want, could only be done by a still more dynamic language. Something like a macro-processing system or a language that do not have variables but something like labels that can be attached to anything. But this would also make compiler-creation for it much more difficult -- hence fully dynamic. The compiler would have to take all coding in the program into account.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You can override Bar's __new__ method to execute arbitrary code and return a new instance. See: <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html#object.__new__" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html#object.__new__</a></p>

<p>Here's a contrived example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class Bar(object):
...     def __new__(cls):
...             print "Calling Bar.__new__"
...             return super(Bar, cls).__new__(cls)
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; bar = Bar()
Calling Bar.__new__
&gt;&gt;&gt; bar
&lt;__main__.Bar object at 0x0222B3D0&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: I misunderstood what you wanted, your clarification cleared that up. I don't think what you want is possible.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>If you want the results of foo(), the easiest way is to do this:</p>

<pre><code>foo()
</code></pre>

<p>Anything else is just unnecessary complication. I suspect that you have oversimplified your example until it doens't make sense.</p>

<p>Edit: OK, so you are trying to change somebody elses code. No, it's not possible to transform a variable to a method in a generic way. You could replace it with an object that will return different variables of it's used in a way that consistently will cause some sort of python method to be called. </p>

<p>barrio.py:
    bar = "Some sort of string"</p>

<p>fool.py:</p>

<pre><code>import random

class Foo:
    def __str__(self):
        return str(random.random())

import barrio
barrio.bar = Foo()
</code></pre>

<p>Now run python:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import fool
&gt;&gt;&gt; import barrio

&gt;&gt;&gt; print barrio.bar
0.783394625457
&gt;&gt;&gt; print barrio.bar
0.662363816543
&gt;&gt;&gt; print barrio.bar
0.342930701226
&gt;&gt;&gt; print barrio.bar
0.781452467433
</code></pre>

<p>This works because print will call <strong>str</strong> on the object, since it's not a string. But in general, no, it's not possible.</p>
