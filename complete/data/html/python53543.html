<h3>Question (ID-53543):</h3><h2>What are some strategies to write python code that works in CPython, Jython and IronPython</h2><p>Having tries to target two of these environments at the same time I can safely say the if you have to use a database etc. you end up having to write unique code for that environment. Have you got a great way to handle this situation?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>If you <em>do</em> find you need to write unique code for an environment, use pythons </p>

<pre><code>import mymodule_jython as mymodule

import mymodule_cpython as mymodule
</code></pre>

<p>have this stuff in a simple module (''module_importer''?) and write your code like this:</p>

<pre><code>from module_importer import mymodule
</code></pre>

<p>This way, all you need to do is alter <code>module_importer.py</code> per platform.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>@<a href="#53549" rel="nofollow">Daren Thomas</a>: I agree, but you should use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/dev/library/platform.html#platform.python_implementation" rel="nofollow">platform module</a> to determine which interpreter you're running.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I write code for CPython and IronPython but tip should work for Jython as well.</p>

<p>Basically, I write all the platform specific code in separate modules/packages and then import the appropriate one based on platform I'm running on. (see cdleary's comment above)</p>

<p>This is especially important when it comes to the differences between the SQLite implementations and if you are implementing any GUI code.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The #1 thing IMO:  <strong>Focus on thread safety</strong>.  CPython's GIL makes writing threadsafe code easy because only one thread can access the interpreter at a time.  IronPython and Jython are a little less hand-holding though.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I'm pretty sure you already know this but unfortunately Jython <a href="http://www.jython.org/Project/userfaq.html#is-jython-the-same-language-as-python" rel="nofollow">can't load c extension modules.</a></p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>There are two <em>major</em> issues at play here...</p>

<p>Firstly, to my knowledge, only CPython has RAII - you have to close your own resources in Jython, Ironpython, etc.</p>

<p>And Secondly, as has been mentioned, is thread safety.</p>
