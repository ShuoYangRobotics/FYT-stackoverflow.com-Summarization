<h3>Question (ID-48884):</h3><h2>Amazon API library for Python?</h2><p>What Python libraries do folks use for querying Amazon product data? (Amazon Associates Web Service - used to be called E-Commerce API, or something along those lines).</p>

<p>Based on my research, PyAWS (<a href="http://pyaws.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">http://pyaws.sourceforge.net/</a>) seems okay, but still pretty raw (and hasn't been updated in a while).  Wondering if there's an obvious canonical library that I'm just missing.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>There is now another alternative: <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-amazon-product-api/">python-amazon-product-api</a>. It supports API version <s>2009-11-01</s> 2010-12-01.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I'm using <a href="https://github.com/dlo/bottlenose" rel="nofollow">Bottlenose</a>, Dan Loewenherz's "super awesome Python wrapper for the Amazon Product Advertising API". It doesn't parse the XML, so I'm using <a href="http://codespeak.net/lxml/objectify.html" rel="nofollow">lxml.objectify</a>:</p>

<pre><code>AWS_KEY = "..."
SECRET_KEY = "..."

import bottlenose
amazon = bottlenose.Amazon(AWS_KEY, SECRET_KEY)
response=amazon.ItemLookup(ItemId="B0018AFK38", ResponseGroup="OfferSummary")

from lxml import objectify
root = objectify.fromstring(response)
root.Items.Item.OfferSummary.LowestNewPrice.FormattedPrice
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>PyAWS is no longer hosted on SourceForge. The latest version (0.3.0) is available via the <a href="http://kunxi.org/archives/2008/05/pyaws-030-released/" rel="nofollow">authors website</a>.</p>

<p>Make sure you also grab the patch for Amazons latest API changes, mentioned in the comments.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>pyaws seems to be the best one out there.  I used it here (<a href="http://utilitymill.com/edit/get_Book_Data_by_ISBNs" rel="nofollow">my source code</a>)  It worked fine for me.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>The only other library I'm aware of is <a href="http://www.josephson.org/projects/pyamazon/" rel="nofollow">pyAmazon</a>, which is the predecessor of pyaws.  If you're familiar with the Amazon API (or are willing to become so), you could probably put together something yourself with <a href="http://pywebsvcs.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">ZSI</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>pyaws is the best in my opinion.  The most available version is 0.2.0, but there is also a version 0.3.0 that is somewhat harder to find.  The best maintained version of it that I have found though, which is based on 0.3.0, is on <a href="http://bitbucket.org/johnpaulett/pyaws/overview/" rel="nofollow">bitbucket</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>How about <a href="http://code.google.com/p/boto/" rel="nofollow">boto</a>? Anyone have any experience with it? I just started looking for a Python package for Amazon and boto looks up to date (v1.8c release 28-Jun-2009), active and complete (has a long list of supported interfaces).</p>
