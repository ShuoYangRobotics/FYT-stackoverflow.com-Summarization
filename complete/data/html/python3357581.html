<h3>Question (ID-3357581):</h3><h2>Using Python class as a data container</h2><p>Sometimes it makes sense to cluster related data together.  I tend to do so with a dict, e.g.,</p>

<pre><code>self.group = dict(a=1, b=2, c=3)
print self.group[a]
</code></pre>

<p>One of my colleagues prefers to create a class</p>

<pre><code>class groupClass(object):
    def __init__(a, b, c):
        self.a = a
        self.b = b
        self.c = c
self.group = groupClass(1, 2, 3)
print self.group.a
</code></pre>

<p>Note that we are not defining any class methods.</p>

<p>I like to use a dict because I like to minimize the number of lines of code.  My colleague thinks the code is more readable if you use a class, and it makes it easier to add methods to the class in the future.</p>

<p>Which do you prefer and why?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>If you're really never defining any class methods, a dict or a <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple" rel="nofollow">namedtuple</a> make far more sense, in my opinion.  Simple+builtin is good! To each his own, though.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I prefer to follow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_ain%27t_gonna_need_it" rel="nofollow">YAGNI</a> and use a dict.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>In a language which supports it, I would use a <code>struct</code>. A dictionary would be closest to a structure in Python, at least as far as I see it.</p>

<p>Not to mention, you could add a method to a dictionary anyway if you <em>really</em> wanted to ;)</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I disagree that the code is more readable using a class with no methods. You usually expect functionality from a class, not only data.</p>

<p>So, I'd go for a dict until the need for functionality arises, and then the constructor of the class could receive a dict :-)</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>A dict is obviously appropriate for that situation. It was designed specifically for that use case. Unless you are actually going to use the class as a class, there's no use in reinventing the wheel and incurring the additional overhead / wasting the space of a class that acts as a bad dictionary (no dictionary features).</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Your way is better. Don't try to anticipate the future too much as you are not likely to succeed.</p>

<p>However, <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/classes.html#odds-and-ends" rel="nofollow">it may make sense sometimes to use something like a C struct</a>, for example if you want to identify different types rather than use dicts for everything.</p>
