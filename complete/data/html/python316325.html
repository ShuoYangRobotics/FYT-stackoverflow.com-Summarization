<h3>Question (ID-316325):</h3><h2>"import wx" fails after installation of wxPython on Windows XP</h2><p>I downloaded and installed this version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WxPython" rel="nofollow">wxPython</a> for use with my Python 2.6 installation:</p>

<p><a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/wxpython/wxPython2.8-win32-unicode-2.8.9.1-py26.exe" rel="nofollow">http://downloads.sourceforge.net/wxpython/wxPython2.8-win32-unicode-2.8.9.1-py26.exe</a></p>

<p>When I run Python and try to import wx, I get the following error:</p>

<pre><code>C:\Program Files\Console2&gt;python
Python 2.6 (r26:66721, Oct  2 2008, 11:35:03) [MSC v.1500 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; import wx

<p>I have already tried removing wxPython and installing again and I got the same error.  How can I fix this problem?</p>

<p>After some googling found this link to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=9B2DA534-3E03-4391-8A4D-074B9F2BC1BF&amp;displaylang=en" rel="nofollow">MSVC++ 2008 Redestributable</a> and installed it.  </p>

<p>That solved the problem.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Try the ANSI version instead of the Unicode one. IIRC it needs to match the Python 2.6 install to work properly.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>From looking for "application configuration is incorrect" in the <a href="http://trac.wxwidgets.org/" rel="nofollow">wxPython trac system</a>, the only reference that might make sense is a 64-bit vs 32-bit compatibility issue.  </p>

<p>Otherwise, I'd say <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/316325/import-wx-fails-after-installation-of-wxpython-on-windows-xp/316466#316466">Brian's answer</a> of trying ANSI is pretty good.</p>

<p>BTW, if you try uninstalling again, make go into the site-packages folder and make sure all the wx and wxPython stuff is deleted.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Copy the Microsoft C runtime library v.9 files and manifest. That is, <code>msvcr90.dll</code> and <code>microsoft.vc90.crt.manifest</code> from folder <code>python</code> to the folder wx, tha is, folder which contains failed to start DLLs. </p>

<p>Or install the Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I too have the same issue.Better install "Portable Python" IDE which comes with some nice modules including wxPython .You can start coding GUI immediately without the need to download a separate wxPython.The link ,

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Hate to say this, but I had the same problem, and and import worked fine after a reboot.</p>
