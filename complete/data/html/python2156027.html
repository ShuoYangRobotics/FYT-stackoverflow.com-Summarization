<h3>Question (ID-2156027):</h3><h2>What questions should every good Python developer be able to answer?</h2><p>What questions do you think should a good Python programmer be able to respond to?</p>

<p>PS: I have seen this question based on other languages but not Python!</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-15):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Why should you refer to "names" and "binding" in Python instead of "variables" and "assignment"?</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><ol>
<li>how do you sort a list of dicts by the value each has for key <code>'foo'</code>?</li>
<li>how do you get the highest 10 integers out of a list of a million integers?</li>
<li>how do you sort a list of strings in case-insensitive alphabetical order?</li>
<li>given a list of ints, how do you make a string with their str forms separated by spaces?</li>
</ol>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>What is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing" rel="nofollow">duck typing</a> ?</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>How can you use a mutable object as a default value to a function?</p>

<p>And the closely related...</p>

<p>What are possible consequences of doing this?</p>

<pre><code>def append_to( b, c=[] ):
    c.append( b )
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Some fancier language features:</p>

<ul>
<li>What are generators, iterators? (bonus points for <em>views</em>)</li>
<li>What are "new-style" classes
and how do they differ from old-style
classes?</li>
<li>What are packages, how do you make one?</li>
<li>What are decorators?</li>
</ul>

<p>I'd say anyone with some experience has used one of these:</p>

<ul>
<li>Where can you find a deque, priority queue, 
binheap implementation?</li>
<li>Have you worked with Twisted, SciPy, 
NumPy, GTK/Qt/Wx?</li>
<li>What is PyPi, what is easy_install ?</li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I have a list of lists:</p>

<pre><code>l=[[0]]*10
print(l)
# [[0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0]]
</code></pre>

<p>Why is it that when I change one element, all the elements change:</p>

<pre><code>l[0][0]=1
print(l)
# [[1], [1], [1], [1], [1], [1], [1], [1], [1], [1]]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>What's a Python decorator and how is it used?</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Why does this happen?  Why isn't the answer -1?</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 3.1-4.1
-0.99999999999999956
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>What is the difference between str and unicode, and which would you use in what circumstances?</p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>What is list comprehension? What is 'lambda' used for?</p>
<br /><b>#10</b><br /><p>What is going to print :</p>

<pre><code>def paradox():
    try:
        raise Exception("Here")
    except:
        return "There"
    finally:
        return "Or maybe there"

    return "Or it that here?"

print paradox()
</code></pre>

<p>I love this one, because even the best programmers idle before answering.</p>
<br /><b>#11</b><br /><p>This is the most often heard question (at least to me)</p>

<p><strong>Why would I use python if I already know xxxx (insert any language here) ?</strong> </p>

<p>I know, not as impressive as the other answers....</p>
<br /><b>#12</b><br /><p>What kinds of application would Python <strong><em>not</em></strong> be good for?</p>
<br /><b>#13</b><br /><ul>
<li>What do you get when you do <code>"hello " * n</code> where <code>n</code> is a number.</li>
<li>What does <code>10 ** 2</code> do?</li>
<li>How do you unpack a tuple?</li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#14</b><br /><p>Why is mutability and immutability important?  When ought you to care?  (Note: The author of this question is still quite fuzzy on these.)</p>

<p>While much is "batteries included," what are the three most esoteric add-ons to Python you have used?  </p>

<p>What is your general strategy for researching and performing Windows functions in Python?  </p>

<p>Tell me about your favorite Python idiom.  How did you discover it?  How did you refine it?</p>

<p>What are some of the shortcomings in the development of Python and the surrounding ecosystem?</p>
