<h3>Question (ID-7756069):</h3><h2>"List index out of range" error in Python</h2><p>I am making a simple Checkers again. And, in order to keep track of all the locations for the checkers to move to, I created a list to add all of the locations.</p>

<pre><code>Locations = [(10, 10), (70, 10), (130, 10), (190, 20), (250, 10), (310, 10), \
         (370, 10), (430, 10), (10, 70), (130, 70), (190, 70), (250, 70), \
         (310, 70), (370, 70), (430, 70), (10, 130), (70, 130), (130, 130), \
         (190, 130), (250, 130), (310, 130), (370, 130), (430, 130), \
         (10, 190), (70, 190), (130, 190), (190, 190), (250, 190), (310, 190), \
         (370, 190), (430, 190)]
</code></pre>

<p>However, when I try to execute the program, I always get:
Ld8 = Locations[31] - list index out of range</p>

<p>So, I thought maybe a list can only contain certain amount of numbers. So, I created a second Locations list and added rows E - H, so to split up the list. But, I still receive the same error of index being out of range.
(Ld8 is the variable storing the location for Row D, Column 8)</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; Locations = [(10, 10), (70, 10), (130, 10), (190, 20), (250, 10), (310, 10), (370, 10), (430, 10), (10, 70), (130, 70), (190, 70), (250, 70), (310, 70), (370, 70), (430, 70), (10, 130), (70, 130), (130, 130), (190, 130), (250, 130), (310, 130), (370, 130), (430, 130), (10, 190), (70, 190), (130, 190), (190, 190), (250, 190), (310, 190), (370, 190), (430, 190)]
&gt;&gt;&gt; len(Locations)
31
&gt;&gt;&gt; Locations[0] # first element
(10, 10)
&gt;&gt;&gt; Locations[30] # last element
(430, 190)
&gt;&gt;&gt; Locations[31] # doesn't exist!
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
IndexError: list index out of range
</code></pre>

<p>The elements in Locations go from 0 to 30, because there are 31 elements in total.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>List indexes start from 0. So your list has 31 items you can access them with indexes 0-30. Locations[31] refers to the 32nd item which doesn't exist</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>The largest index in that list is 30, not 31. Indexes in lists (in most languages) start with zero. So <code>(10,10)</code> is at index 0 and <code>(430,190)</code> is at index 30.</p>

<p>If you are trying to index at the end of the list in python, I suggest you index by <code>Locations[-1]</code>.</p>

<p>If you are trying to use <code>len</code>, you need to subtract 1: <code>Locations[len(Locations) - 1]</code></p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Emm... The list's elements are numbered from 0, not from 1. I have counted your list and I see elements from 0 to 30.</p>

<p>Sometimes I even forget it's possible to start counting at 1...</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Locations[31] tries to access the 32nd item in the list (which doesn't exist)</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Indexes of arrays for most programming languages start at <code>0</code> and not <code>1</code>.</p>
