<h3>Question (ID-1774487):</h3><h2>Am I supposed to use PyQT4 for programming cross-platform software in Python?</h2><p>So a user suggested getting PyQT.</p>

<p>A quick Google gave me this: <a href="http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download" rel="nofollow">Link</a></p>

<p>Is this GUI Library for pay?</p>

<p>If my development environment is Ubuntu Linux, what should I download on that site. I have no idea.</p>

<p>Please provide links if the site I provided is not correct to what I need. Thank you.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You may want to look at <a href="http://www.pyside.org/" rel="nofollow">PySide</a> which is sponsored by Nokia, who own QT.  It's also LGPL, which is a bit better of a license than the PyQT bindings.  It's also a bit more pythonic in how it works.  Unfortunately, it's new, so there isn't as much documentation.  On their download page you can find information about a PPA for Ubuntu which will make it so your bindings automatically stay up to date.</p>

<p>If you want to run PyQT then just use APT and install python-qt3 or python-qt4.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I will answer the question you have stated in title</p>

<p>"Am I supposed to use PyQT4 for programming cross-platform software in Python?"</p>

<p><strong>No.</strong></p>

<p>You can use wxPython (<a href="http://www.wxpython.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wxpython.org/</a>), it is a quite decent GUI toolkit base on wxWdigets and many commercial applications are written in wxPython e.g. www.mockupscreens.com</p>

<p>wxpython works on Mac/linux/Windows, has a very good support for custom widgets and provides a native looks on each platform, though you are free to design you own widgets/skins.</p>

<p>PyQT is comparable or may be in some cases better but costly for non GPL applications(<a href="http://qt.nokia.com/products/licensing" rel="nofollow">http://qt.nokia.com/products/licensing</a>), but wxPython is free as free beer (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WxPython#License" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WxPython#License</a>).</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>PyQT is released under multiple licenses: <a href="http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/license" rel="nofollow">http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/license</a></p>

<p>You only need to pay if you don't want to release your product under the GPL.</p>

<p>PyQT isn't the only option for cross platform GUI in Python. There are many others too: <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming</a></p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Near the top of the page you will find:</p>

<h2>Source Packages</h2>

<p>This is the latest stable version of PyQt4.</p>

<pre>
PyQt-x11-gpl-4.6.2.tar.gz     Linux, UNIX source
PyQt-win-gpl-4.6.2.zip        Windows source
PyQt-mac-gpl-4.6.2.tar.gz     MacOS/X source
</pre>

<p>For Ubuntu, choose the first one.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>In Ubuntu Linux, for PyQT try the package <a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/karmic/python-qt4" rel="nofollow">python-qt4</a>.</p>

<p>An alternative is <a href="http://www.wxpython.org/" rel="nofollow">wxpython</a>, and in Ubuntu the package is <a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/karmic/python-wxgtk2.8" rel="nofollow">python-wxgtk2.8</a>.</p>

<p>Another possibility to consider, that is considered an integral part of the Python distribution, is <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/tkinter.html" rel="nofollow">Tkinter</a>, a Python interface to the <a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/karmic/python-tk" rel="nofollow">Tk GUI toolkit</a>. Tkinter is not necessarily considered as "good looking" as wxPython or PyQT, but it is definitely cross-platform, and has the blessing of being <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/tkinter.html" rel="nofollow">part of the Python distribution</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You should try pyQt and wxPython both, but You will know which one better when you release your program to public.</p>

<p>you can install wxpython with synaptic easily.</p>

<p>and here is helloworld for wxpython</p>

<pre><code>import wx
app = wx.App()
frame = wx.Frame(None, wx.ID_ANY, "Hello World")
frame.Show(True)
app.MainLoop()
</code></pre>

<p>Just my 2 cents, Sorry, If you dont like to use it.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>For cross-platform qt is the best option. GTK doesn't look well on windows, wxwidget/wxpython is ok but not so powerful and tkinter is too ugly/basic. Besides, qt4 is LGPL so you can link  with it even if your application is not GPL.</p>
