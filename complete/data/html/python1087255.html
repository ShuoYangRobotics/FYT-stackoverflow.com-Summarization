<h3>Question (ID-1087255):</h3><h2>Use of eval in Python?</h2><p>There is an eval function in Python I stumbled upon while playing around.</p>

<p>I cannot think of a case when this function is needed, except maybe as syntactic sugar.</p>

<p>Can anyone give an example?</p>

<p>Thanks :)</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-9):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p><code>eval</code> and <code>exec</code> are handy quick-and-dirty way to get some source code dynamically, maybe munge it a bit, and then execute it -- but they're hardly ever the best way, especially in production code as opposed to "quick-and-dirty" prototypes &amp;c.</p>

<p>For example, if I had to deal with such dynamic Python sources, I'd reach for the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/ast.html#module-ast" rel="nofollow">ast</a> module -- <code>ast.literal_eval</code> is MUCH safer than <code>eval</code> (you can call it directly on a string form of the expression, if it's a one-off and relies on simple constants only, or do <code>node = ast.parse(source)</code> first, then keep the <code>node</code> around, perhaps munge it with suitable visitors e.g. for variable lookup, then <code>literal_eval</code> the node) -- or, once having put the node in proper shape and vetted it for security issues, I could <code>compile</code> it (yielding a code object) and build a new function object out of that. Far less simple (except that <code>ast.literal_eval</code> is just as simple as <code>eval</code> for the simplest cases!) but safer and preferable in production-quality code.</p>

<p>For many tasks I've seen people (ab-)use <code>exec</code> and <code>eval</code> for, Python's powerful built-ins, such as <code>getattr</code> and <code>setattr</code>, indexing into <code>globals()</code>, &amp;c, provide preferable and in fact often simpler solutions. For specific uses such as parsing JSON, library modules such as <code>json</code> are better (e.g. see SilentGhost's comment on tinnitus' answer to this very question). Etc, etc...</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eval#Uses">Wikipedia article on <code>eval</code></a> is pretty informative, and details various uses.</p>

<p>Some of the uses it suggests are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Evaluating mathematical expressions</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping%5F%28compilers%29">Compiler bootstrapping</a></li>
<li>Scripting (dynamic languages in general are very suitable to this)</li>
<li>Language tutors</li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You may want to use it to allow users to enter their own "scriptlets": <strong>small</strong> expressions (or even small functions), that can be used to customize the behavior of a <strong>complex</strong> system.<br />
In that context, and if you do not have to care too much for the security implications (e.g. you have an educated userbase), then eval() may be a good choice.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>In a program I once wrote, you had an input file where you could specify geometric parameters both as values and as python expressions of the previous values, eg:</p>

<pre><code>a=10.0
b=5.0
c=math.log10(a/b)
</code></pre>

<p>A python parser read this input file and obtained the final data evaluating the values and the expressions using eval().</p>

<p>I don't claim it to be good programming, but I did not have to drive a nuclear reactor.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>In the past I have used eval() to add a debugging interface to my application. I created a telnet service which dropped you into the environment of the running application. Inputs were run through eval() so you can interactively run Python commands in the application.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p><code>eval()</code> is not normally very useful. One of the few things I have used it for (well, it was <code>exec()</code> actually, but it's pretty similar) was allowing the user to script an application that I wrote in Python. If it were written in something like C++, I would have to embed a Python interpreter in the application.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Eval is a way to interact with the Python interpreter from within a program. You can pass literals to eval and it evaluates them as python expressions.</p>

<p>For example - </p>

<pre><code>print eval("__import__('os').getcwd()")
</code></pre>

<p>would return the current working directory.</p>

<p>cheers</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>I use it as a quick JSON parser ...</p>

<pre><code>r='''
{
    "glossary": {
        "title": "example glossary"
        }
}
'''

print eval(r)['glossary']['title']
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>I use <code>exec</code> to create a system of plugins in Python.</p>

<pre>
    try:
        exec ("from " + plugin_name + " import Plugin")
        myplugin = Plugin(module_options, config=config)
    except ImportError, message:
        fatal ("No such module " + plugin_name + \
               " (or no Plugin constructor) in my Python path: " + str(message))
    except Exception:
        fatal ("Module " + plugin_name + " cannot be loaded: " + \
               str(sys.exc_type) + ": " + str(sys.exc_value) + \
               ".\n    May be a missing or erroneous option?")
</pre>

<p>With a plugin like:</p>

<pre>
class Plugin:

    def __init__ (self):
        pass

    def query(self, arg):
         ...
</pre>

<p>You will be able to call it like:</p>

<pre>
    result = myplugin.query("something")
</pre>

<p>I do not think you can have plugins in Python without <code>exec</code>/<code>eval</code>.</p>
