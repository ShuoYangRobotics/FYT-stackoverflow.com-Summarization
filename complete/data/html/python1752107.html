<h3>Question (ID-1752107):</h3><h2>How to loop until EOF in Python?</h2><p>I need to loop until I hit the end of a file-like object, but I'm not finding an "obvious way to do it", which makes me suspect I'm overlooking something, well, obvious.  :-)</p>

<p>I have a stream (in this case, it's a StringIO object, but I'm curious about the general case as well) which stores an unknown number of records in "&lt;length>&lt;data>" format, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>data = StringIO("\x07\x00\x00\x00foobar\x00\x04\x00\x00\x00baz\x00")
</code></pre>

<p>Now, the only clear way I can imagine to read this is using (what I think of as) an initialized loop, which seems a little un-Pythonic:</p>

<pre><code>len_name = data.read(4)

while len_name != "":
    len_name = struct.unpack("&lt;I", len_name)[0]
    names.append(data.read(len_name))

    len_name = data.read(4)
</code></pre>

<p>In a C-like language, I'd just stick the <code>read(4)</code> in the <code>while</code>'s test clause, but of course that won't work for Python.  Any thoughts on a better way to accomplish this?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You can combine iteration through <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#iter" rel="nofollow">iter()</a> with a sentinel:</p>

<pre><code>for block in iter(lambda: file_obj.read(4), ""):
  use(block)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Have you seen how to iterate over lines in a text file?</p>

<pre><code>for line in file_obj:
  use(line)
</code></pre>

<p>You can do the same thing with your own generator:</p>

<pre><code>def read_blocks(file_obj, size):
  while True:
    data = file_obj.read(size)
    if not data:
      break
    yield data

for block in read_blocks(file_obj, 4):
  use(block)
</code></pre>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I see, as predicted, that the typical and most popular answer are using very specialized generators to "read 4 bytes at a time".  Sometimes generality isn't any harder (and much more rewarding;-), so, I've suggested instead the following very general solution:</p>

<pre><code>import operator
def funlooper(afun, *a, **k):
  wearedone = k.pop('wearedone', operator.not_)
  while True:
    data = afun(*a, **k)
    if wearedone(data): break
    yield data
</code></pre>

<p>Now your desired loop header is just: <code>for len_name in funlooper(data.read, 4):</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: made much more general by the <code>wearedone</code> idiom since a comment accused my slightly less general previous version (hardcoding the exit test as <code>if not data:</code>) of having "a hidden dependency", of all things!-)</p>

<p>The usual swiss army knife of looping, <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/itertools.htm" rel="nofollow"><code>itertools</code></a>, is fine too, of course, as usual:</p>

<pre><code>import itertools as it

for len_name in it.takewhile(bool, it.imap(data.read, it.repeat(4))): ...
</code></pre>

<p>or, quite equivalently:</p>

<pre><code>import itertools as it

def loop(pred, fun, *args):
  return it.takewhile(pred, it.starmap(fun, it.repeat(args)))

for len_name in loop(bool, data.read, 4): ...
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I prefer the already mentioned iterator-based solution to turn this into a for-loop. Another solution written directly is Knuth's "loop-and-a-half"</p>

<pre><code>while 1:
    len_name = data.read(4)
    if not len_name:
        break
    names.append(data.read(len_name))
</code></pre>

<p>You can see by comparison how that's easily hoisted into its own generator and used as a for-loop.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>The EOF marker in python is an empty string so what you have is pretty close to the best you are going to get without writing a function to wrap this up in an iterator. I could be written in a little more pythonic way by changing the <code>while</code> like:</p>

<pre><code>while len_name:
    len_name = struct.unpack("&lt;I", len_name)[0]
    names.append(data.read(len_name))
    len_name = data.read(4)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I'd go with Tendayi's suggestion re function and iterator for readability:</p>

<pre><code>def read4():
    len_name = data.read(4)
    if len_name:
        len_name = struct.unpack("&lt;I", len_name)[0]
        return data.read(len_name)
    else:
        raise StopIteration

for d in iter(read4, ''):
    names.append(d)
</code></pre>
