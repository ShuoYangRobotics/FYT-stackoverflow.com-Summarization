<h3>Question (ID-890485):</h3><h2>Python: How do I write a list to file and then pull it back into memory (dict represented as a string convert to dict) later?</h2><p>More specific dupe of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/875228/simple-data-storing-in-python">875228â€”Simple data storing in Python</a>.</p>

<p>I have a rather large dict (6 GB) and I need to do some processing on it.  I'm trying out several document clustering methods, so I need to have the whole thing in memory at once.  I have other functions to run on this data, but the contents will not change.</p>

<p>Currently, every time I think of new functions I have to write them, and then re-generate the dict.  I'm looking for a way to write this dict to a file, so that I can load it into memory instead of recalculating all it's values.</p>

<p>to oversimplify things it looks something like:
    {((('word','list'),(1,2),(1,3)),(...)):0.0, ....}</p>

<p>I feel that python must have a better way than me looping around through some string looking for : and ( trying to parse it into a dictionary.</p>

Python has a great serializing module called pickle it is very easy to use.</p>

<pre><code>import cPickle
cPickle.dump(obj, open('save.p', 'wb')) 
obj = cPickle.load(open('save.p', 'rb'))
</code></pre>

<p>There are two disadvantages with pickle:</p>

<ul>
<li>It's not secure against erroneous or
maliciously constructed data. Never
unpickle data received from an
untrusted or unauthenticated source.</li>
<li>The format is not human readable.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are using python 2.6 there is a builtin module called <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/json.html" rel="nofollow">json</a>. It is as easy as pickle to use:</p>

<pre><code>import json
encoded = json.dumps(obj)
obj = json.loads(encoded)
</code></pre>

<p>Json format is human readable and is very similar to the dictionary string representation in python. And doesn't have any security issues like pickle. But might be slower than cPickle.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I'd use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/shelve.html" rel="nofollow"><code>shelve</code></a>, <code>json</code>, <code>yaml</code>, or whatever, as suggested by other answers. </p>

<p><code>shelve</code> is specially cool because you can have the <code>dict</code> on disk and still use it. Values will be loaded on-demand.</p>

<p>But if you really want to parse the text of the <code>dict</code>, and it contains only <code>str</code>ings, <code>int</code>s and <code>tuple</code>s like you've shown, you can use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/ast.html#ast.literal%5Feval" rel="nofollow"><code>ast.literal_eval</code></a> to parse it. It is a lot safer, since you can't eval full expressions with it - It only works with <code>str</code>ings, numbers, <code>tuple</code>s, <code>list</code>s, <code>dict</code>s, <code>bool</code>eans, and <code>None</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import ast
&gt;&gt;&gt; print ast.literal_eval("{12: 'mydict', 14: (1, 2, 3)}")
{12: 'mydict', 14: (1, 2, 3)}
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I would suggest that you use <a href="http://www.yaml.org/" rel="nofollow">YAML</a> for your file format so you can tinker with it on the disc</p>

<pre><code>How does it look:
  - It is indent based
  - It can represent dictionaries and lists
  - It is easy for humans to understand
An example: This block of code is an example of YAML (a dict holding a list and a string)
Full syntax: http://www.yaml.org/refcard.html
</code></pre>

<p>To get it in python, just easy_install pyyaml. See <a href="http://pyyaml.org/" rel="nofollow">http://pyyaml.org/</a></p>

<p>It comes with easy file save / load functions, that I can't remember right this minute.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I would use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zope%5FObject%5FDatabase" rel="nofollow">ZODB</a> if you need a dict too large to fit into memory to be persistent. </p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Write it out in a serialized format, such as pickle (a python standard library module for serialization) or perhaps by using JSON (which is a representation that can be evaled to produce the memory representation again).</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>This solution at SourceForge uses only standard Python modules:</p>

<p>y_serial.py module :: warehouse Python objects with SQLite</p>

<p>"Serialization + persistance :: in a few lines of code, compress and annotate Python objects into SQLite; then later retrieve them chronologically by keywords without any SQL. Most useful "standard" module for a database to store schema-less data."</p>

<p><a href="http://yserial.sourceforge.net" rel="nofollow">http://yserial.sourceforge.net</a></p>

<p>The compression bonus will probably reduce your 6GB dictionary to 1GB. If you do not want a store a series of dictionaries, the module also contains a file.gz solution which might be more suitable given your dictionary size.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>You can also write simple data structures in human- and Python-readable form with <code>repr</code>. The inverse operation is <code>eval</code>:</p>

<pre><code>x = {1: (2, 3, 'four')}
print repr(x)
print eval(repr(x), {})
</code></pre>

<p>Some caveats:</p>

<ul>
<li>eval is vulnerable to code injection attacks, since it runs arbitrary Python code passed to it.</li>
<li>for some data types, repr emits a string, which eval cannot read.</li>
</ul>
