<h3>Question (ID-594266):</h3><h2>Equation parsing in Python</h2><p>How can I (easily) take a string such as <code>"sin(x)*x^2"</code> which might be entered by a user at runtime and produce a Python function that could be evaluated for any value of <code>x</code>?  Does anyone know of any libraries or modules that takes care of this sort of thing?</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Python's own internal compiler can parse this, if you use Python notation.</p>

<p>If your change the notation slightly, you'll be happier.</p>

<pre><code>import compiler
eq= "sin(x)*x**2"
ast= compiler.parse( eq )
</code></pre>

<p>You get an abstract syntax tree that you can work with.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><pre><code> f = parser.parse('sin(x)*x^2').to_pyfunc()
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>parser</code> could be defined using PLY, pyparsing, builtin tokenizer, parser, ast.</p>

<p>Don't use <code>eval</code> on user input.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>pyparsing might do what you want (http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/) especially if the strings are from an untrusted source.</p>

<p>See also <a href="http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/file/view/fourFn.py" rel="nofollow">http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/file/view/fourFn.py</a> for a fairly full-featured calculator built with it.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>To emphasize J.F. Sebastian's advice, 'eval' and even the 'compiler' solutions can be open to subtle security holes. How trustworthy is the input? With 'compiler' you can at least filter out things like getattr lookups from the AST, but I've found it's easier to use PLY or pyparsing for this sort of thing than it is to secure the result of letting Python help out.</p>

<p>Also, 'compiler' is clumsy and hard to use. It's deprecated and removed in 3.0. You should use the 'ast' module (added in 2.6, available in 2.5 as '_ast').</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>In agreement with vartec. I would use SymPy - in particular the lambdify function should do exactly what you want.</p>

<p>for a very nice explanation of this.</p>

<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>You can use Python <code>parser</code>:</p>

<pre><code>import parser
formula = "sin(x)*x**2"
code = parser.expr(formula).compile()

from math import sin
x = 10
print eval(code)
</code></pre>

<p>It performs better than pure <code>eval</code>.</p>
