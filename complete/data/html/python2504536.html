<h3>Question (ID-2504536):</h3><h2>Why allow concatenation of string literals?</h2><p>I was recently bitten by a subtle bug.</p>

<pre><code>char ** int2str = {
   "zero", // 0
   "one",  // 1
   "two"   // 2
   "three",// 3
   nullptr };

assert( int2str[1] == std::string("one") ); // passes
assert( int2str[2] == std::string("two") ); // fails
</code></pre>

<p>If you have godlike code review powers you'll notice I forgot the <code>,</code> after <code>"two"</code>.</p>

<p>After the considerable effort to find that bug I've got to ask <em>why would anyone ever want this behavior?</em></p>

<p>I can see how this might be useful for macro magic, but then why is this a "feature" in a modern language like python?</p>

<p>Have you ever used string literal concatenation in production code?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Sure, it's the easy way to make your code look good:</p>

<pre><code>char *someGlobalString = "very long "
                         "so broken "
                         "onto multiple "
                         "lines";
</code></pre>

<p>The best reason, though, is for weird printf formats, like type forcing:</p>

<pre><code>uint64_t num = 5;
printf("Here is a number:  %"PRIX64", what do you think of that?", num);
</code></pre>

<p>There are a bunch of those defined, and they can come in handy if you have type size requirements.  Check them all out <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/inttypes.h.html" rel="nofollow">at this link</a>.  A few examples:</p>

<pre><code>PRIo8 PRIoLEAST16 PRIoFAST32 PRIoMAX PRIoPTR
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>It's a great feature that allows you to combine preprocessor strings with your strings.</p>

<pre><code>// Here we define the correct printf modifier for time_t
#ifdef TIME_T_LONG
    #define TIME_T_MOD "l"
#elif defined(TIME_T_LONG_LONG)
    #define TIME_T_MOD "ll"
#else
    #define TIME_T_MOD ""
#endif

// And he we merge the modifier into the rest of our format string
printf("time is %" TIME_T_MOD "u\n", time(0));
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Cases where this can be useful:</p>

<ul>
<li>Generating strings including components defined by the preprocessor (this is perhaps the largest use case in C, and it's one I see very, very frequently).</li>
<li>Splitting string constants over multiple lines</li>
</ul>

<p>To provide a more concrete example for the former:</p>

<pre><code>// in version.h
#define MYPROG_NAME "FOO"
#define MYPROG_VERSION "0.1.2"

// in main.c
puts("Welcome to " MYPROG_NAME " version " MYPROG_VERSION ".");
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>From the python lexical analysis reference, section 2.4.2:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This feature can be used to reduce the
  number of backslashes needed, to split
  long strings conveniently across long
  lines, or even to add comments to
  parts of strings</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/lexical_analysis.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/reference/lexical_analysis.html</a></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>So that you can split long string literals across lines.</p>

<p>And yes, I've seen it in production code.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I'm not sure about other programming languages, but for example C# doesn't allow you to do this (and I think this is a good thing). As far as I can tell, most of the examples that show why this is useful in C++ would still work if you could use some special operator for string concatenation:</p>

<pre><code>string someGlobalString = "very long " +
                          "so broken " +
                          "onto multiple " +
                          "lines"; 
</code></pre>

<p>This may not be as comfortable, but it is certainly safer. In your motivating example, the code would be invalid unless you added either <code>,</code> to separate elements or <code>+</code> to concatenate strings...</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I certainly have in both C and C++. Offhand, I don't see much relationship between its utility and how "modern" the language is.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>While people have taken the words out of my mouth about the practical uses of the feature, nobody has so far tried to defend the choice of syntax.</p>

<p>For all I know, the typo that can slip through as a result was probably just overlooked.  After all, it seems robustness against typos wasn't at the front of Dennis's mind, as shown further by:</p>

<pre><code>if (a = b);
{
    printf("%d", a);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Furthermore, there's the possible view that it wasn't worth using up an extra symbol for concatenation of string literals - after all, there isn't much else that can be done with two of them, and having a symbol there might create temptation to try to use it for runtime string concatenation, which is above the level of C's built-in features.</p>

<p>Some modern, higher-level languages based on C syntax have discarded this notation presumably because it is typo-prone.  But these languages have an operator for string concatenation, such as <code>+</code> (JS, C#), <code>.</code> (Perl, PHP), <code>~</code> (D, though this has also kept C's juxtaposition syntax), and constant folding (in compiled languages, anyway) means that there is no runtime performance overhead.</p>
