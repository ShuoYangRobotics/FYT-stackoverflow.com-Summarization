<h3>Question (ID-1056051):</h3><h2>How do you call Python code from C code?</h2><p>I want to extend a large C project with some new functionality, but I really want to write it in Python.  Basically, I want to call Python code from C code.  However, Python->C wrappers like SWIG allow for the OPPOSITE, that is writing C modules and calling C from Python.</p>

<p>I'm considering an approach involving IPC or RPC (I don't mind having multiple processes); that is, having my pure-Python component run in a separate process (on the same machine) and having my C project communicate with it by writing/reading from a socket (or unix pipe).  my python component can read/write to socket to communicate.  Is that a reasonable approach?  Is there something better?  Like some special RPC mechanism?</p>

<p>Thanks for the answer so far - <strong>however, i'd like to focus on IPC-based approaches since I want to have my Python program in a separate process as my C program.  I don't want to embed a Python interpreter.  Thanks!</strong></p>

It starts by explaining how to execute strings of Python code, then from there details how to set up a Python environment to interact with your C program, call Python functions from your C code, manipulate Python objects from your C code, etc.</p>

<p><b>EDIT</b>: If you really want to go the route of IPC, then you'll want to use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/struct.html" rel="nofollow">the struct module</a>.  Most communication between a Python and C process revolves around passing structs back and forth, either <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/socket.html" rel="nofollow">over a socket</a> or through <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/mmap.html" rel="nofollow">shared memory</a>.</p>

<p>I recommend creating a <code>Command</code> struct with fields and codes to represent commands and their arguments.  I can't give much more specific advice without knowing more about what you want to accomplish, but in general I recommend the <a href="http://courtwright.org/protlib/" rel="nofollow">protlib</a> library, since it's what I use to communicate between C and Python programs (disclaimer: I am the author of protlib).</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>See the relevant chapter in the manual: <a href="http://docs.python.org/extending/" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/extending/</a></p>

<p>Essentially you'll have to embed the python interpreter into your program.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Have you considered just wrapping your python application in a shell script and invoking it from with in your C application?</p>

<p>Not the most elegant solution, but it is very simple.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I haven't used an IPC approach for Python&lt;->C communication but it should work pretty well. I would have the C program do a standard fork-exec and use redirected <code>stdin</code> and <code>stdout</code> in the child process for the communication. A nice text-based communication will make it very easy to develop and test the Python program.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>If I had decided to go with IPC, I'd probably splurge with <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/" rel="nofollow">XML-RPC</a> -- cross-platform, lets you easily put the Python server project on a different node later if you want, has many excellent implementations (see <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/directory/1568/implementations" rel="nofollow">here</a> for many, including C and Python ones, and <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/simplexmlrpcserver.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> for the simple XML-RPC server that's part the Python standard library -- not as highly scalable as other approaches but probably fine and convenient for your use case).</p>

<p>It may not be a perfect IPC approach for all cases (or even a perfect RPC one, by all means!), but the convenience, flexibility, robustness, and broad range of implementations outweigh a lot of minor defects, in my opinion.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>apparently Python need to be able to compile to win32 dll, it will solve the problem</p>

<p>In such a way that converting c# code to win32 dlls will make it usable by any development tool</p>
