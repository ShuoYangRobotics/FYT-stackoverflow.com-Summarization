<h3>Question (ID-1648956):</h3><h2>How to assert that zero or only one of N given arguments is passed</h2><p>I have a definition like this</p>

<pre><code>def bar(self, foo=None, bar=None, baz=None):
    pass
</code></pre>

<p>I want to make sure a maximum of one of foo, bar, baz is passed. I can do </p>

<pre><code>if foo and bar:
    raise Ex()

if foo and baz:
    raise Ex()
....
</code></pre>

<p>But there got be something simpler.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>How about:</p>

<pre><code> initialisers = [foo, bar, baz]
 if initialisers.count(None) &lt; len(initialisers) - 1:
     raise Ex()
</code></pre>

<p>It simply counts how many <code>None</code> are present. If they're all <code>None</code> or only one isn't then fine, otherwise it raises the exception.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><code>x!=None</code> returns <code>True</code> (whose numeric value is <code>1</code>!) for non-Nones, <code>False</code> (whose numeric value is 0) for Nones.  So,</p>

<pre><code>sum(x!=None for x in (foo, bar, baz))
</code></pre>

<p>is the simplest way to count how many of those identifiers are bound to non-None values (and you can check that count against 1 just like other answers do for <em>their</em> ways of obtaining the count).  This is a very general approach in that instead of <code>x!=None</code> you could be using any strictly-bool predicate of interest; for example if you have a bunch of integers and want to know how many of them have <code>3</code> as the first digit of their decimal representation,</p>

<pre><code>sum(str(abs(x)).startswith('3') for x in (a, b, c, d, e))
</code></pre>

<p>works fine too.</p>

<p>Don't be queasy about "summing bools": Python bools are sharply defined as a subclass of int with exactly two instances which have peculiar str/repr but otherwise behave exactly like the plain ints 0 and 1. There are good pragmatical reasons for this design and the ability to do arithmetic on bools is one of them, so feel free to <strong>use</strong> that ability!-)</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Try</p>

<pre><code> count = sum(map(lambda x: 0 if x is None else 1, (foo, bar, baz)))
 if count &gt; 1:
     raise Ex()
</code></pre>

<p>That turns <code>None</code> into 0 and everything into 1 and then sums everything up.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I have even shorter answer, with my favorite python feature - decorators:</p>

<pre><code>def single_keyword(func):
    def single_keyword_dec(*args, **kw):
        if len(kw) &gt; 1:
            raise Exception("More than one initializer passed: {0}".format(kw.keys()))
        return func(*args, **kw)
    return single_keyword_dec

@single_keyword
def some_func(self, foo=None, bar=None, baz=None):
    print foo, bar, baz

some_func(object, foo=0)
some_func(object, foo=0, bar=0)
#result
0 None None
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "dec2.py", line 13, in &lt;module&gt;
    some_func(object, foo=0, bar=0)
  File "dec2.py", line 4, in single_keyword_dec
    raise Exception("More than one initializer passed: {0}".format(kw.keys()))
Exception: More than one initializer passed: ['foo', 'bar']
</code></pre>

<p>If you need distinguish between 'foo', 'bar', 'baz' and some other keywords, you could make similiar decorator which would accept list of keywords to restrict, and use it like this: <code>@single_keyword('foo', 'bar', 'baz')</code></p>

<p>This way its 100% code reuse, no typing same thing over and over, and you get proper keywords in your function, not some obscure dict.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><pre><code>if len(filter(lambda x: x != None, locals().values())) &gt; 1:
    raise Exception()
</code></pre>

<p>Edited to address Alex's point.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Like this.</p>

<pre><code>def func( self, **kw ):
    assert len(kw) == 1, "Too Many Arguments"
    assert kw.keys[0] in ( 'foo', 'bar', 'baz' ), "Argument not foo, bar or baz"
</code></pre>
