<h3>Question (ID-4240114):</h3><h2>Easy-to-learn language like Python, but which requires variable declaration?</h2><p>Python is super easy to learn and understand; I like it for its use of keywords, lack of intricate syntax (opposite of perl, from what I've heard), and easy-to-use data structures. However, I can't stand the lack of variable declaration, because it makes it impossible to explicitly tell Python what scope you want the variable to have. Are there any languages that have all the qualities I like about Python <em>as well as</em> variable declaration, and perhaps a decent set of libraries available?</p>

<p>Thankslot.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You can try using Python with variable declarations:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 0 # a global variable
&gt;&gt;&gt; def fact(n): #n is a parameter
...     x = 0 # local variable declaration
...     z = 1 # declaration and initialization
...     for i in range(1, n + 1): # a loop variable is defined inline
...         z = z * i
...     return z
...     
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 5 # the global x
&gt;&gt;&gt; fact(x)
120
</code></pre>

<p>Can you explain what is the problem with this? Also, like Nick Bastin said in a comment, it would help if you explain if your problem is with declaration or scope.</p>

<p>If your problem is with the syntax or with static typing, would the next syntax be acceptable to you?</p>

<pre><code>def f(double x):
    return x**2-x

def integrate_f(double a, double b, int N):
    cdef int i
    cdef double s, dx
    s = 0
    dx = (b-a)/N
    for i in range(N):
        s += f(a+i*dx)
    return s * dx
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://docs.cython.org/src/quickstart/cythonize.html" rel="nofollow">This syntax</a> is that of <a href="http://www.cython.org/" rel="nofollow">Cython</a>, a language for extending Python using compiled (C) extensions.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>C# </p>

<p>Here are some <a href="http://www.csharp-examples.net/examples/" rel="nofollow">code examples</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Try Google's <a href="http://golang.org" rel="nofollow">Go</a> if you are not talking about production code.  The language is just over a year old.  It is very easy to learn as well.  This suggestion is only because you asked for <em>any languages</em>.</p>

<p>Otherwise, Wim Coenen's answer should simply work for you.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You can also have a look at Perl 6, which removes the problems you described in Perl 5, but maintains the benefits, with option to even have strongly typed variables. The problem is that it's still not finished, and nobody knows when it will...</p>

<p>Either way you can check <a href="http://dev.perl.org" rel="nofollow">dev.perl.org</a> if you are insterested.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p><a href="http://cython.org/" rel="nofollow">Cython</a> is a lot like Python but has variable declaration that is like C (actually, Cython allows for a lot of stuff that is present in C).</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>How about <a href="http://boo.codehaus.org/" rel="nofollow">Boo</a>.  CLR, very Python-like.  Static types with type inference.</p>
