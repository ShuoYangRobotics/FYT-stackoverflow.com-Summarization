<h3>Question (ID-1206793):</h3><h2>Django ORM for desktop application</h2><p>Recently, I have become increasingly familiar with Django. I have a new project that I am working on that will be using Python for a desktop application. Is it possible to use the Django ORM in a desktop application? Or should I just go with something like <a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/" rel="nofollow">SQLAlchemy</a>?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The Django people are sensible people with a philosophy of decoupling things. So yes, in theory you should be perfectly able to use Django's ORM in a standalone application. </p>

<p>Here's one guide I found: <a href="http://jystewart.net/process/2008/02/using-the-django-orm-as-a-standalone-component/" rel="nofollow">Django ORM as a standalone component</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I would suggest using SQLAlchemy and a declarative layer on top of it such as <a href="http://elixir.ematia.de/trac/wiki" rel="nofollow" title="Elixir">Elixir</a> if you prefer a Django-like syntax.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Yes it is. The Commonsense Computing Project at the MIT media lab does that for ConceptNet,
a semantic network. You can get the source here: <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ConceptNet/4.0b3" rel="nofollow">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ConceptNet/4.0b3</a></p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The peewee ORM has a declarative syntax that should be familiar to django users, and can be used as a standalone.  Here are the project <a href="http://charlesleifer.com/docs/peewee/" rel="nofollow">docs</a></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I would suggest another ORM for a desktop application maybe SQLAlchemy or SQLObject.
It i possible to use the django ORM but I think other ORM are a better ones if you are going to use them standalone.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.python-camelot.com/" rel="nofollow">Camelot</a> seems promising if you want to do Python desktop apps using a DB. It uses SQLAlchemy though. Haven't tried it yet.</p>
