<h3>Question (ID-8321525):</h3><h2>python dictionary creation</h2><p>I have a class called Polynomial, and it stores information to the polynomial in a dictionary. The keys are the exponents and the values are the coefficients. To create an instance of the Polynomial class, you type the following:</p>

<pre><code>P1 = Polynomial((2, 14), (2, 11), (-12, 3), (42, 0))
</code></pre>

<p>The first item in the pairing is the coefficient, and the second item is the exponent.</p>

<p>The initialization looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Polynomial:
def __init__(self, *termpairs):
    termdict = dict(termpairs)
    self.termdict = {}
    for x, y in termdict.items():
        self.termdict[y] = x
</code></pre>

<p>Now if I have two coefficients that are the same, for example ((2, 14), (2, 11)), It will only create a dictionary for one of them like so:</p>

<pre><code>{11: 2}
</code></pre>

<p>Im not sure why the one pairing is not showing up. Any thoughts?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>A dictionary has one value per key. What would <code>self.termdict[11]</code> return otherwise?</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The problem is here:</p>

<pre><code>termdict = dict(termpairs)
</code></pre>

<p>You are "converting" your <code>termpairs</code> to a dict, so you will get something like:</p>

<pre><code>((2, 14), (2, 11), (-12, 3), (42, 0)) =&gt; {2: 14, 2: 11, -12: 3, 42: 0}
</code></pre>

<p>In a <code>dict</code> there cannot be two items with the same key, so the second one (<code>2: 11</code>) is overwriting the first one (<code>2: 14</code>).</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Why are you converting it to a <code>dict</code> anyway? This would be a simpler solution (with no <code>dict</code> conversion):</p>

<pre><code>def __init__(self, *termpairs):
    self.termdict = {}
    # termpairs is a tuple of tuples
    for x, y in termdict:
        self.termdict[y] = x
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Because your dictionary <code>termdict</code> (not <code>self.termdict</code>) maps <em>coefficients</em> to <em>powers</em>, then the same coefficient forces only the second one to be used (i.e., <code>(2, 11)</code> erases <code>(2, 14)</code>). Instead, you want to replace your class with:</p>

<pre><code>class Polynomial:
    def __init__(self, *termpairs):
        termdict = dict([ (b, a) for a, b in termpairs ])
        self.termdict = {}
        for x, y in termdict.items():
            self.termdict[x] = y
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>This is your culprit:</p>

<pre><code>termdict = dict(termpairs)
</code></pre>

<p>This creates a dictionary where the keys are the coefficients and the values are the exponents. Since it's a dictionary, each key points to one value, so at this point you lose the <code>(2, 14)</code> pair -- there can't be more than one item with the key <code>2</code>. That you then proceed to switch 'em around makes no difference; you've already dropped some data on the floor.</p>

<p>I'm not sure why you're putting them in a dictionary to begin with, and then iterating over that to make a second dictionary. Why not just put them in the way you want to begin with?</p>

<pre><code>self.termdict = dict(reversed(pair) for pair in termpairs)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You're overwriting the older values each time you add to the dictionary, you need to do something such as adding the values into a list and storing that list as the value.</p>

<p>the dictionary structure would look like:</p>

<p><code>{ 2:[14,11], -12:[3], 42:[0] }</code><br>
and will allow you to store multiple pairs.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You don't need to create the <code>termdict</code> dictionary, just iterate over the items of the tuple (untested):</p>

<pre><code>class Polynomial(object):
    def __init__(self, *termpairs):
        self.termdict = {}
        for x, y in termpairs:
            self.termdict[y] = x
</code></pre>
