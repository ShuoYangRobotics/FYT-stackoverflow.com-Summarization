<h3>Question (ID-7567318):</h3><h2>Python: How to make a list of n numbers and randomly select any number?</h2><p>I have taken a count of something and it came out to N</p>

<p>Now I would like to have a list, containing 0 to N numbers in it.
Example: 
N = 5
then, <code>count_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</code></p>

<p>How would I be able to do that?</p>

<p>Also, once I have created the list, 
I would like to randomly select a number from that list and use that number.
After that I would like to select another number from the remaining numbers of the list (N-1) and then use that also. 
This goes on it the list is empty. 
could someone please help me with this?
Thanks</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You can try this code</p>

<pre><code>import random
N = 5
count_list = range(1,N+1)
random.shuffle(count_list)

while count_list:
    value = count_list.pop()
    # do whatever you want with 'value'
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You can create the enumeration of the elements by something like that:</p>

<pre><code>mylist = list(xrange(10))
</code></pre>

<p>then you can use the <code>random.choice</code> function to select your items:</p>

<pre><code>import random
...
random.choice(mylist)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>As Asim Ihsan correctly stated, my answer does not yet address the full problem of the OP. To remove the values from the list, simply <code>list.remove()</code> can be called:</p>

<pre><code>import random
...
value = random.choice(mylist)
mylist.remove(value)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>As for the first part:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; N = 5
&gt;&gt;&gt; count_list = [i+1 for i in xrange(N)]
&gt;&gt;&gt; count_list
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>As for the second, read this:
<a href="http://docs.python.org/library/random.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/library/random.html</a></p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from random import choice
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = choice(count_list)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; count_list.remove(a)
&gt;&gt;&gt; count_list
[2, 3, 4, 5]
</code></pre>

<p>That's the general idea.</p>

<p>There are a few implementations of fast random selection.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You can use:</p>

<pre><code>import random
random.choice(range(n))
</code></pre>

<p>or:</p>

<pre><code>random.choice(range(1,n+1))
</code></pre>

<p>if you want it from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code> and not from <code>0</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Create the list (edited):</p>

<pre><code>count_list = range(1, N+1)
</code></pre>

<p>Select random element:</p>

<pre><code>import random
random.choice(count_list)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You don't need to count stuff if you want to pick a random element. Just use <code>random.choice()</code> and pass your iterable:</p>

<pre><code>import random
items = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
print random.choice(items)
</code></pre>

<p>If you really have to count them, use <code>random.randint(1, count+1)</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><blockquote>
  <p>After that I would like to select another number from the remaining numbers of the list (N-1) and then use that also.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then you arguably do not really want to create a list of numbers from 1 to N just for the purpose of picking one (why not just ask for a random number in that range directly, instead of explicitly creating it to choose from?), but instead to shuffle such a list. Fortunately, the <code>random</code> module has you covered for this, too: just use <code>random.shuffle</code>.</p>

<p>Of course, if you have a huge list of numbers and you only want to draw a few, then it certainly makes sense to draw each using <code>random.choice</code> and remove it.</p>

<p>But... why do you want to select numbers from a range, that corresponds to the count of some items? Are you going to use the number to select one of the items? Don't do that; that's going out of your way to make things too complicated. If you want to select one of the items, then do so directly - again with <code>random.choice</code>.</p>
