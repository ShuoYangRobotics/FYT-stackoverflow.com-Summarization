<h3>Question (ID-2264889):</h3><h2>What statically typed languages are similar to Python?</h2><p>Python is the nicest language I currently know of, but static typing is a big advantage due to auto-completion (although there is limited support for dynamic languages, it is nothing compared to that supported in static). I'm curious if there are any languages which try to add the benefits of Python to a statically typed language. In particular I'm interesting in languages with features like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Syntax support: such as that for dictionaries, array comprehensions</li>
<li>Functions: Keyword arguments, closures, tuple/multiple return values</li>
<li>Runtime modification/creation of classes</li>
<li>Avoidance of specifying classes everywhere (in Python this is due to duck typing, although type inference would work better in a statically typed language)</li>
<li>Metaprogramming support: This is achieved in Python through reflection, annotations and metaclasses</li>
</ul>

<p>Are there any statically typed languages with a significant number of these features?</p>

The syntax is <em>highly</em> inspired by Python, and hashes/lists/array are part of the syntax:</p>

<pre><code>i = 5
if i &gt; 5:
    print "i is greater than 5."
else:
    print "i is less than or equal to 5."

hash = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'monkey': 3, 42: 'the answer'}
print hash['a']
print hash[42]

for item in hash:
    print item.Key, '=&gt;', item.Value

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><a href="http://cobra-language.com/" rel="nofollow">Cobra</a> is a statically typed language for the CLR (as Boo). From its web page:</p>

 - first class support for unit tests and contracts
 - compiled performance with scripting conveniences
 - lambdas and closures
 - extensions and mixins

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Although it is not object-oriented, <a href="http://www.haskell.org/" rel="nofollow"><strong>Haskell</strong></a> offers a significant number of the features that interest you:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Syntax support for list comprehensions, plus <code>do</code> notation for a wide variety of sequencing/binding constructs.  (Syntax support for dictionaries is limited to lists of pairs, e.g, </p>

<pre><code>dict = ofElements [("Sputnik", 1957), ("Apollo", 1969), ("Challenger", 1988)]
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Functions support full  closures and multiple return values using tuple types.  Keyword arguments are not supported but a powerful feature of "implicit arguments" can sometimes substitute.</p></li>
<li><p>No runtime modification of classes, types or objects.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoidance of specificying classes/types everywhere through <em>type inference</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Metaprogramming using Template Haskell.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Also, just so you will feel at home, Haskell has significant indentation!</p>

<p>I actually think Haskell has quite a different feel from Python overall, but that is primarily because of the extremely powerful static type system.   If you are interested in trying a statically typed language, Haskell is one of the most ambitious ones out there right now.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>try the Go programming language ? I've seen some similar paradigm.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>If auto-completion is the thing you are looking for, then you might wanna stick with Python and use a great IDE instead.</p>

<p>Try PyCharm: <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/index.html</a></p>

<p>Unless you are coding some extremely dynamic stuff (which you can't probably do in a static language anyway), it will keep up with the code and give you completion, refactoring and all the other goodies we are used to in statically typed languages.</p>

<p>You can give typehints to the IDE where you really need it by doing:</p>

<pre><code>def foo(bar):
    if 0: bar = Bar() # "if 0" will be removed from the bytecode automatically by python
    bar. # will now autocomplete
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>The D programming language is a statically typed, natively compiled language that has some significant features inspired by Python.</p>

<p>Arrays and associative arrays are built into the language.  There are no list comprehensions, but the std.range and std.algorithm libraries fill much of that void.  For example, here's a way to sum up all the even numbers from 0 to 100 in D:</p>

<pre><code>auto result = reduce!"a + b"(
    filter!"a % 2 == 0"(
        iota(0, 100)
    )
);
</code></pre>

<p>There are no keyword arguments so far, but closures are there.  Tuples are supported, but not unpacked automatically.</p>

<p>In D, you avoid specifying classes (and types in general) everywhere with the <code>auto</code> keyword and with templates.  For example, here is generic code to find the product of  array of any numeric type:</p>

<pre><code>// The return type of product() is inferred.
auto product(T)(T[] array) {
    T ret = 1;
    foreach(num; array) { // typeof(num) is inferred.
        ret *= num;
    }

    return ret;
}
</code></pre>

<p>D's metaprogramming support consists of compile time introspection (for example, you can iterate over the fields of a class or struct at compile time), runtime type information, and templates that are actually designed for metaprogramming beyond simple generics.  For example, here's how to write a generic function that generates a default comparison operation for two structs, which is useful if you need an arbitrary total ordering for something like a binary tree:</p>

<pre><code>/**Returns -1 if lhs &lt; rhs, 0 if lhs == rhs, 1 if lhs &gt; rhs.*/
int compareStructs(T)(T lhs, T rhs) {
    foreach(tupleIndex, value; lhs.tupleof) {
        if(value &lt; rhs.tupeof[tupleIndex]) {
            return -1;
        } else if(value &gt; rhs.tupleof[tupleIndex]) {
            return 1;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Autocompletion is still possible in a dynamically typed language; nothing prevents the IDE from doing type inference or inspection, even if the language implementation doesn't.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>I think Eric and PyScripter have nice autocompletion on Windows, but maybe not as good as PyTools for Visual Studio (Express).</p>

<p>For static typing in Python, i'd use Cython: <a href="http://docs.cython.org/src/quickstart/cythonize.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.cython.org/src/quickstart/cythonize.html</a></p>
