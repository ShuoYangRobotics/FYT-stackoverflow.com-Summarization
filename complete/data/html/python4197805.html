<h3>Question (ID-4197805):</h3><h2>Python for-loop look-ahead</h2><p>I have a python for loop, in which I need to look ahead one item to see if an action needs to be performed before processing.</p>

<pre><code>for line in file:
    if the start of the next line == "0":
        perform pre-processing
        ...
    continue with normal processing
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>Is there any easy way to do this in python?
My current approach is to buffer the file to an array, however this is not ideal as the file is rather large.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>you can get any iterable to prefetch next item with this recipe:</p>

<pre><code>from itertools import tee, islice, izip_longest
def get_next(some_iterable, window=1):
    items, nexts = tee(some_iterable, 2)
    nexts = islice(nexts, window, None)
    return izip_longest(items, nexts)
</code></pre>

<p>Example usage:</p>

<pre><code>for line, next_line in get_next(myfile):
    if next_line and next_line.startswith("0"):
        ... do stuff
</code></pre>

<p>The code allows you to pass the <code>window</code> parameter as a larger value, if you want to look 2 or more lines ahead.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You can have a <code>prev_line</code> where you store previous line and process that whenever you read a line only given your condition.</p>

<p>Something like:</p>

<pre><code>prev_line = None
for line in file:
    if prev_line is not None and the start of the next line == "0":
        perform pre-processing on prev_line
        ...
    continue with normal processing
    ...
    prev_line = line
</code></pre>

<p>You may need to do additional processing for the last line if necessary, depending on your logic.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Along the lines of nosklo's answer, I tend to use the following pattern:</p>

<p>The function <code>pairwise</code> from the excellent <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/itertools.html#recipes" rel="nofollow">itertools recipes</a> is ideal for this:</p>

<pre><code>from itertools import tee

def pairwise(iterable):
    "s -&gt; (s0,s1), (s1,s2), (s2, s3), ..."
    a, b = tee(iterable)
    next(b, None)
    return izip(a, b)
</code></pre>

<p>Using it in your code gets us:</p>

<pre><code>for line, next_line in pairwise(file):
    if next_line.startswith("0"):
        pass #perform pre-processing
        #...
    pass #continue with normal processing
</code></pre>

<p>Generally, for this type of processing (lookahead in the iterable), I tend to use a <a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2006-May/065304.html" rel="nofollow">window function</a>. Pairwise is a special case of a window of size 2.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You simply need to buffer one line.</p>

<pre><code>for line in file:
  if (prevLine is not None):
    //test line as look ahead and then act on prevLine
  prevLine = line
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>This should work too. I always prefer calling <code>next</code> over setting <code>something = None</code> for the first round.</p>

<pre><code>prev_line = next(the_file)
for current_line in the_file:
    if current_line.startswith('0'):
        do_stuff( prev_line )
    # continue with normal processing
    # ...
    prev_line = current_line
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I'm not a Python expert but I'd imagine you'd need to use 2 loops for this.  The first run through of the for loop should build a list of indexes for which you'll need to perform a special operation.  Then on the second run through you can compare the current index with your list to determine if you need to perform that special operation.</p>
