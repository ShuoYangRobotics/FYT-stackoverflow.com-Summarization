<h3>Question (ID-1546089):</h3><h2>web scraping a problem site</h2><p>I'm trying to scrape some information from a web site, but am having trouble reading the relevant pages.  The pages seem to first send a basic setup, then more detailed info.  My download attempts only seem to capture the basic setup.  I've tried urllib and mechanize so far.</p>

<p>Firefox and Chrome have no trouble displaying the pages, although I can't see the parts I want when I view page source.</p>

<p>A sample url is <a href="https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0542&amp;FundIntExt=INT" rel="nofollow">https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0542&amp;FundIntExt=INT</a></p>

<p>I'd like, for example, average maturity and average duration from the lower right of the page. The problem isn't extracting that info from the page, it's downloading the page so that I can extract the info.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The page uses JavaScript to load the data.  Firefox and Chrome are only working because you have JavaScript enabled - try disabling it and you'll get a mostly empty page.</p>

<p>Python isn't going to be able to do this by itself - your best compromise would be to control a real browser (Internet Explorer is easiest, if you're on Windows) from Python using something like <a href="http://pamie.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">Pamie</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The website loads the data via ajax. <a href="http://getfirebug.com" rel="nofollow">Firebug</a> shows the ajax calls. For the given page, the data is loaded from <a href="https://personal.vanguard.com/us/JSP/Funds/VGITab/VGIFundOverviewTabContent.jsf?FundIntExt=INT&amp;FundId=0542" rel="nofollow">https://personal.vanguard.com/us/JSP/Funds/VGITab/VGIFundOverviewTabContent.jsf?FundIntExt=INT&amp;FundId=0542</a></p>

<p>See the corresponding javascript code on the original page:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;populator = new Populator({parentId:
"profileForm:vanguardFundTabBox:tab0",execOnLoad:true,
 populatorUrl:"/us/JSP/Funds/VGITab/VGIFundOverviewTabContent.jsf?FundIntExt=INT&amp;FundId=0542",
inline:fals   e,type:"once"});
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>The reason why is because it's performing AJAX calls after it loads.  You will need to account for searching out those URLs to scrape it's content as well.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>As RichieHindle mentioned, your best bet on Windows is to use the WebBrowser class to create an instance of an IE rendering engine and then use that to browse the site.</p>

<p>The class gives you full access to the DOM tree, so you can do whatever you want with it.</p>

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I've tinkered only a little bit, but it seems the professional version of <a href="http://www.screen-scraper.com" rel="nofollow">screen-scraper</a> can do it.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Try iMacros. I am very positive it will solve your problem.</p>
