<h3>Question (ID-7902658):</h3><h2>How to parse a mixed CSV file in Python?</h2><p>I am dealing with a CSV file similar to this one</p>

<pre><code>foo; val1; position1
bar; name1; address1; phone_nbr1
bar; name2; address2; phone_nbr2
foo; val2; position2
bar; name3; address3; phone_nbr3
bar; name4; address4; phone_nbr4
bar; name5; address5; phone_nbr5
bar; name6; address6; phone_nbr6
foo; val3; position3
</code></pre>

<p>Needless to say, I cannot modify the CSV.</p>

<p>Instances displayed in <code>foo</code> lines are different from the ones with <code>bar</code> lines (notice they don't even have the same number of fields)</p>

<p>I need simply reading this data, no need to write it.</p>

<p>My first idea was to separate the file into two temporary files and then read each one separately with a <code>csv.DictReader</code>, however I really don't like this approach.</p>

<p>Is there a simpler way to do this? I would like to avoid if possible having to write files to disk.</p>

<p>For the record, I'm using Python2.7 on a Solaris 10 machine.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You could collect the records from a <code>csv.reader</code> in two different lists, depending on their length (or whatever criterion you use to distinguish the two streams):</p>

<pre><code>list1 = []
list2 = []
with open("input.csv", "rb") as f:
    for record in csv.reader(f, delimiter=";"):
        if len(record) == 3:
            list1.append(record)
        else:
            list2.append(record)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><code>csv.reader()</code> has no problem with this:</p>

<pre><code>import csv
foo = []
bar = []
with open("test.csv", 'r') as f:
    c = csv.reader(f, delimiter = ";")
    for row in c:
        if row[0] == "foo":
            foo.append(row[1:])
        elif row[0] == "bar":
            bar.append(row[1:])
print(a)
print(b)
</code></pre>

<p>results in</p>

<pre><code>[[' val1', ' position1'], [' val2', ' position2'], [' val3', ' position3']]
[[' name1', ' address1', ' phone_nbr1'], [' name2', ' address2', ' phone_nbr2'], [' name3', ' address3', ' phone_nbr3'], [' name4', ' address4', ' phone_nbr4'], [' name5', ' address5', ' phone_nbr5'], [' name6', ' address6', ' phone_nbr6']]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>What about just using <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" rel="nofollow"><code>str.split</code></a> on each line?</p>

<pre><code>items = line.split(";")
</code></pre>

<p>Then if the first item in the <code>items</code> list is <code>foo</code> you do one thing, and if it's <code>bar</code> you do something else.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The fact that the lines are different is not a problem for <code>csv</code> module, but you'll have to analyze line content differently depending on first 'cell'.</p>

<p>Example of code:</p>

<pre><code>with open(input_file, 'rb') as fin:
    c = csv.reader(fin)
    for line in c:
         if line[0] == 'foo':
              # do some treatment
         elif line[0] == 'bar':
              # do something else
    c.close()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>It's not clear from your question what it is you actually want to achieve, but I'm not sure you need the csv module here.</p>

<pre><code>for row in myfile.readlines():
    cols = [r.strip() for r in row.split(';')]
    if (cols[0] == "foo"):
        # Do something for foo
    elif (cols[0] == "bar"):
        # Do something for bar
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>What about something like:</p>

<pre><code>foos = []
bars = []
for line in csv.reader(open("file.csv","rb"), delimiter=";"):
  if line[0] == "foo":
    foos.append(Foo(line[1], line[2]))
  else:
    bars.append(Bar(line[1], line[2], line[3]))
</code></pre>

<p>Assuming you have a <code>Foo</code> and a <code>Bar</code> class taking the rest of your line cells as arguments.</p>
