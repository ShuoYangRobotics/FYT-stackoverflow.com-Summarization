<h3>Question (ID-433669):</h3><h2>Analyse python list with algorithm for counting occurences over date ranges</h2><p>The following shows the structure of some data I have (format: a list of lists)</p>

<pre><code>data = 
[ 
  [1,2008-12-01],
  [1,2008-12-01],
  [2,2008-12-01]
  ... (the lists continue)
]
</code></pre>

<p>The dates range from 2008-12-01 to 2008-12-25.</p>

<p>The first field identifies a user by id, the second field (a date field) shows when this user visited a page on my site. </p>

<p>I need to analyse this data so that i get the following results</p>

<p>25 users visted on 1 day<br />
100 users visted on 2 days<br />
300 users visted on 4 days<br />
... upto 25 days</p>

<p>I am using python and don't know where to start ! </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I'm sorry it seems I wasnt clear enough about what I needed as a few people have given answers that are not what I'm looking for. </p>

<p>I need to find out how many users visited on all the days e.g.<br />
10 users visited on 25 days (or every day)</p>

<p>Then I'd like the to list the same for each frequency of days from 1 - 25. So as per my original example above<br />
25 users visited for only one day (out of the 25)<br />
100 users visited on 2 days (out of the 25)<br />
etc </p>

<p>I DONT need to know how many visited on each day<br />
thanks</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Your result is a dictionary, right?</p>

<pre><code>{ userNumber: setOfDays }
</code></pre>

<p>How about this to get started.</p>

<pre><code>from collections import defaultdict
visits = defaultdict(set)
for user, date in someList:
    visits[user].add(date)
</code></pre>

<p>This gives you a dictionary with a set of dates on which they visited.  </p>

<pre><code>counts = defaultdict(int)
for user in visits:
    v= len(visits[user])
    count[v] += 1
</code></pre>

<p>This gives you a dictionary of # visits, # of users with that many visits.</p>

<p>Is that the kind of thing you're looking for?</p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>This is probably not the most pythonic or efficient or smartest or whatever way of doing this. But maybe you can confirm if I've understood the requirements correctly:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; log=[[1, '2008-12-01'], [1, '2008-12-01'],[2, '2008-12-01'],[2, '2008-12-03'], [1, '2008-12-04'], [3, '2008-12-04'], [4, '2008-12-04']]
&gt;&gt;&gt; all_dates = sorted(set([d for d in [x[1] for x in log]]))
&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(0, len(all_dates)):
...     log_slice = [d for d in log if d[1] &lt;= all_dates[i]]
...     num_users = len(set([u for u in [x[0] for x in log_slice]]))
...     print "%d users visited in %d days" % (num_users, i + 1)
... 
2 users visited in 1 days
2 users visited in 2 days
4 users visited in 3 days
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>First, I should mention that you NEED to store the date as a string. Currently, it would do arithmetic on your current entry. So, if you format <code>data</code> like this, it will work better:</p>

<pre><code>data = 
[ 
  [1,"2008-12-01"],
  [1,"2008-12-01"],
  [2,"2008-12-01"]
]
</code></pre>

<p>Next, we can do something like this to get the number for each day:</p>

<pre><code>result = {}
for (id, date) in data:
    if date not in result:
        result[date] = 1
    else:
        result[date] += 1
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can get the number of users for a specific date by doing something like this:</p>

<pre><code>print result[some_date]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>It is unclear what exactly your requirement are. Here's my take:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
from collections import defaultdict

data = [ 
  [1,'2008-12-01'],
  [3,'2008-12-25'],
  [1,'2008-12-01'],
  [2,'2008-12-01'],
]

d = defaultdict(set)
for id, day in data:
    d[day].add(id)

for day in sorted(d):
    print('%d user(s) visited on %s' % (len(d[day]), day))
</code></pre>

<p>It prints:</p>

<pre><code>2 user(s) visited on 2008-12-01
1 user(s) visited on 2008-12-25
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>How about this: this gives you set of days as well as count:</p>
