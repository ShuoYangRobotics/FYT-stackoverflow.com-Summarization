<h3>Question (ID-2740806):</h3><h2>Python SQLite: database is locked</h2><p>I'm trying this code:</p>

<pre><code>import sqlite

connection = sqlite.connect('cache.db')
cur = connection.cursor()
cur.execute('''create table item
  (id integer primary key, itemno text unique,
        scancode text, descr text, price real)''')

connection.commit()
cur.close()
</code></pre>

<p>I'm catching this exception:</p>

<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "cache_storage.py", line 7, in &lt;module&gt;
    scancode text, descr text, price real)''')
  File "/usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/sqlite/main.py", line 237, in execute
    self.con._begin()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/sqlite/main.py", line 503, in _begin
    self.db.execute("BEGIN")
_sqlite.OperationalError: database is locked
</code></pre>

<p>Permissions for cache.db are ok. Any ideas?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I'm presuming you are actually using sqlite3 even though your code says otherwise. Here are some things to check:</p>

<ol>
<li>That you don't have a hung process sitting on the file (unix: <code>$ fuser cache.db</code> should say nothing)</li>
<li>There isn't a cache.db-journal file in the directory with cache.db; this would indicate a crashed session that hasn't been cleaned up properly.</li>
<li>Ask the database shell to check itself: <code>$ sqlite3 cache.db "pragma integrity_check;"</code></li>
<li>Backup the database <code>$ sqlite3 cache.db ".backup cache.db.bak"</code></li>
<li>Remove cache.db as you probably have nothing in it (if you are just learning) and try your code again</li>
<li>See if the backup works <code>$ sqlite3 cache.db.bak ".schema"</code></li>
</ol>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>here's a neat workaround for simultaneous access...</p>

<pre><code>while(1):
 con=sqlite.connect('user.db',timeout=1)
 c=con.cursor()
 try:
         c.execute("select * from queue")
  res=c.fetchall()
 except sqlite.OperationalError:
      print("database locked")
 num_users=len(res)
</code></pre>

<p>...</p>

<p>works for me .. hunting around for hours paid off...!!</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>The database is locked by another process that is writing to it. You have to wait until the other transaction is committed. See the documentation of connect()</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>One possible reason for the database being locked that I ran into with SQLite is when I tried to access a row that was being written by one app, and read by another at the same time.  You may want to set a busy timeout in your SQLite wrapper that will spin and wait for the database to become free (in the original c++ api the function is <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/busy_timeout.html" rel="nofollow">sqlite3_busy_timeout</a>).  I found that 300ms was sufficient in most cases.</p>

<p>But I doubt this is the problem, based on your post.  Try other recommendations first.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Oh, your traceback gave it away: you have a version conflict. You have installed some old version of sqlite in your local dist-packages directory when you already have sqlite3 included in your python2.6 distribution and don't need and probably can't use the old sqlite version. First try:</p>

<pre><code>$ python -c "import sqlite3"
</code></pre>

<p>and if that doesn't give you an error, <a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#uninstalling-packages" rel="nofollow">uninstall your dist-package</a>:</p>

<pre><code>easy_install -mxN sqlite
</code></pre>

<p>and then <code>import sqlite3</code> in your code instead and have fun.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Set the timeout parameter in your connect call, as in:</p>

<pre><code>connection = sqlite.connect('cache.db', timeout=10)
</code></pre>
