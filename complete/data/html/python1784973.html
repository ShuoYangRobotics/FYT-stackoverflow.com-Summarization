<h3>Question (ID-1784973):</h3><h2>Tuples in Dicts</h2><p>Is it possible in python to add a tuple as a value in a dictionary?<br>
And if it is,how can we add a new value, then? And how can we remove and change it?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = {'tuple': (23, 32)}
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
{'tuple': (23, 32)}
&gt;&gt;&gt; a['tuple'] = (42, 24)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
{'tuple': (42, 24)}
&gt;&gt;&gt; del a['tuple']
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
{}
</code></pre>

<p>if you meant to use tuples as keys you could do:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; b = {(23, 32): 'tuple as key'}
&gt;&gt;&gt; b
{(23, 32): 'tuple as key'}
&gt;&gt;&gt; b[23, 32] = 42
&gt;&gt;&gt; b
{(23, 32): 42}
</code></pre>

<p>Generally speaking there is nothing specific about tuples being in dictionary, they keep behaving as tuples.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You can't change a tuple itself. You have to replace it by a different tuple.</p>

<p>When you use a list, you could also add values to it (changing the list itself) without need to replace it:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; a = {'list': (23, 32)}
&gt;&gt; a
{'list': [23, 32]}
&gt;&gt; a['list'].append(99)
&gt;&gt; a
{'list': [23, 32, 99]}
</code></pre>

<p>In most cases, lists can be used as replacement for tuples (since as much I know they support all tuple functions -- this is duck typing, man!)</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Since tuples are <em>immutable</em>, you cannot add a value to the tuple. What you <em>can</em> do, is construct a new tuple from the current tuple and an extra value. The <code>+=</code> operator does this for you, provided the left argument is a variable (or in this case a dictionary value):</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = {'k': (1, 2)}
&gt;&gt;&gt; t['k'] += (3,)
&gt;&gt;&gt; t
{'k': (1, 2, 3)}
</code></pre>

<p>Regardless, if you plan on altering the tuple value, perhaps it's better to store lists? Those are mutable.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Since you <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1784973/tuples-in-dicts/1785112#1785112">updated</a> your question<sup>&dagger;</sup>, observe the following:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; d = {42: ('name', 'date')}
&gt;&gt;&gt; d[42][0] = 'name2'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
</code></pre>

<p>This happens because, as stated before, tuples are immutable. You cannot change them. If you want to change them, then in fact you'll have to create a new one. Thus:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; d[42] = ('name2', d[42][2])
&gt;&gt;&gt; d
{42: ('name2', 'date')}
</code></pre>

<p><em>As a side note</em>, you may want to use <a href="http://docs.python.org/3.1/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple" rel="nofollow"><code>namedtuple</code></a>s. They work just like regular tuples, but allow you to refer to elements within the tuple <em>by name</em>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from collections import namedtuple
&gt;&gt;&gt; Person = namedtuple('Person', 'name date')
&gt;&gt;&gt; t = {42: Person('name', 'date')}
&gt;&gt;&gt; t[42] = Person('name2', t[42].date)
&gt;&gt;&gt; t
{42: Person(name='name2', date='date')}
</code></pre>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><pre><code>t1=('name','date')
t2=('x','y')

# "Number" is a String key!
d1={"Number":t1}
# Update the value of "Number"
d1["Number"] = t2

# Use a tuple as key, and another tuple as value
d1[t1] = t2

# Obtain values (getters)

# Can throw a KeyError if "Number" not a key
foo = d1["Number"]

# Does not throw a key error, t1 is the value if "Number" is not in the dict
d1.get("Number", t1)

# t3 now is the same as t1
t3 = d1[ ('name', 'date') ]
</code></pre>

<p>You updated your question again. Please take a look at <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict" rel="nofollow">Python dict docs</a>. Python documentation is one of it's strong points! And play with the interpreter (python)on the command line! But let's continue.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>initially key 0</p>

<p>d[0] = ('name', datetime.now())</p></li>
<li><p>id known
d[1] = d[0]
del d[0]</p></li>
<li><p>name changed
tmp = d[1]
d[1] = ( newname, tmp[1] )</p></li>
</ol>

<p>And please consider using a </p>

<pre><code>class Person(object):
    personIdCounter = 1
    def __init__(self):
      self.id = Person.personIdCounter
      Person.personIdCounter += 1
      self.name
      self.date
</code></pre>

<p>then </p>

<pre><code>persons = {}
person = Person()
persons[person.id] = person
person.name = "something"

persons[1].name = "something else"
</code></pre>

<p>That looks better than a tuple and models your data better.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>The question is that:
i want a dictionary with the basic infos of some people lets say.
The dict contains numbers as keys and tuples as values.Tuples contain
the name and the date for every person.
I wann fix a menu choice in which:
1)i can add in the dict a new person(with initional date 0)
2)i can remove a person from the dict (using only his number)
3)i can add a new date(again using only his number)
4)and finally print the dict!</p>

<pre><code>t1=('name','date')
d1={Number:'(name,date)'}
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I was thinking sth like that (the specific doesnt work :ppp):</p>

<pre><code>names=[]                     
dates=[]                   
Number=[]                       

t1=tuple()
t1=(names) + (dates)       

d1=dict((Number)='t1')             


def new_person(name,date,Number1):

    names.append('name')
    print(names)
    grade.append('date')
    print(dates)
    t1=(names) + (dates)
    print(t1)
</code></pre>
