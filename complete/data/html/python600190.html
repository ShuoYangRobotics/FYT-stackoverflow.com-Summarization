<h3>Question (ID-600190):</h3><h2>Python: Choosing between modules and classes</h2><p>In my application I have to maintain some global application state and global application wide methods like currently connected users, total number of answers, create an application config file etc. There are two options:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Make a separate appstate.py file with global variables with functions over them. It looks fine initially but it seems that I am missing <em>something</em> in clarity of my code.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a class AppState with class functions in a appstate.py file, all other modules have been defined by their specific jobs. This looks fine. But now I have to write longer line like appstate.AppState.get_user_list(). Moreover, the methods are not so much related to each other. I can create separate classes but that would be too many classes.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>EDIT: If I use classes I will be using classmethods. I don't think there is a need to instantiate the class to an object.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Sounds like the classic conundrum :-)  In Python, there's nothing dirty or shameful about choosing to use a module if that's the best approach. After all, modules, functions, and the like are, in fact, first-class citizens in the language, and offer introspection and other properties that many other languages use objects to obtain.</p>

<p>The way you've described your options, it kinda sounds like you're not too crazy about a class-based approach in this case.</p>

<p>I don't know if you've used the Django framework, but if not have a look at their documentation on how they handle settings. These are app-wide, they are defined in a module, and they are available gobally. The way they parse the options and expose them globally is quite elegant, and you may find such an approach inspiring for your needs.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The second approach seems better. I'd use the first one only for configuration files or something.</p>

<p>Anyway, to avoid the problem you could always:</p>

<pre><code>from myapp.appstate import AppState
</code></pre>

<p>That way you don't have to write the long line anymore.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>The second approach is only significantly different from the first approach if you have application state stored in an <em>instance</em> of AppState, in which case your complaint doesn't apply. If you're just storing stuff in a class and using static/class methods, your class is no different than a module, and it would be pythonic to instead actually have it as a module.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I would go with the classes route as it will better organize your code.  Remember that for readability you can do this:</p>

<pre><code>from appstate import AppSate
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I'd definitely go for the second option : having already used the first one, I'm now forced to refactor, as my application evolved and have to support more modular constructs, so I now need to handle multiple simulataneous 'configurations'.</p>

<p>The second approach is, IMO, more flexible and future proof. To avoid the longer lines of code, you could use <code>from appstate import AppState</code> instead of just <code>import appstate</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Why not go with an instance of that class? That way you might even be able later on to have 2 different "sessions" running, depending on what instance you use. It might make it more flexible. Maybe add some method <code>get_appstate()</code> to the module so it instanciates the class once. Later on if you might want several instances you can change this method to eventually take a parameter and use some dictionary etc. to store those instances.</p>

<p>You could also use property decorators btw to make things more readable and have the flexibility of storing it how and where you want it stores.</p>

<p>I agree that it would be more pythonic to use the module approach instead of classmethods. </p>

<p>BTW, I am not such a big fan of having things available globally by some "magic". I'd rather use some explicit call to obtain that information. Then I know where things come from and how to debug it when things fail.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Consider this example:</p>

<pre><code>configuration
|
+-&gt; graphics
|   |
|   +-&gt; 3D
|   |
|   +-&gt; 2D
|
+-&gt; sound
</code></pre>

<p>The real question is: What is the difference between classes and modules in this hierarchy, as it could be represented by both means?</p>

<p>Classes represent types.  If you implement your solution with classes instead of modules, you are able to check a graphics object for it's proper type, but write generic graphics functions.</p>

<p>With classes you can generate parametrized values.  This means it is possible to initialize differently the <em>sounds</em> class with a constructor, but it is hard to initialize a module with different parameters.</p>

<p>The point is, that you really something different from the modeling standpoint.</p>
