<h3>Question (ID-1240229):</h3><h2>is it ever useful to define a class method with a reference to self not called 'self' in Python?</h2><p>I'm teaching myself Python and I see the following in <a href="http://diveintopython.org/" rel="nofollow">Dive into Python</a> <a href="http://diveintopython.org/object%5Foriented%5Fframework/defining%5Fclasses.html" rel="nofollow">section 5.3</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By convention, the first argument of any Python class method (the reference to the current instance) is called <code>self</code>. This argument fills the role of the reserved word <code>this</code> in C++ or Java, but <code>self</code> is not a reserved word in Python, merely a naming convention. Nonetheless, please don't call it anything but <code>self</code>; this is a very strong convention.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Considering that <code>self</code> is <em>not</em> a Python keyword, I'm guessing that it can sometimes be useful to use something else.  Are there any such cases?  If not, why is it <em>not</em> a keyword?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>No, unless you want to confuse every other programmer that looks at your code after you write it.  <code>self</code> is not a keyword because it is an identifier.  It <em>could</em> have been a keyword and the fact that it isn't one was a design decision.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>As a side observation, note that Pilgrim is committing a common misuse of terms here: a <em>class method</em> is quite a different thing from an <em>instance method</em>, which is what he's talking about here. As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method%5F%28computer%5Fscience%29" rel="nofollow">wikipedia</a> puts it, "a method is a subroutine that is exclusively associated either with a class (in which case it is called a class method or a static method) or with an object (in which case it is an instance method).". Python's built-ins include a <code>staticmethod</code> type, to make static methods, and a <code>classmethod</code> type, to make class methods, each generally used as a decorator; if you don't use either, a <code>def</code> in a class body makes an instance method. E.g.:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class X(object):
...   def noclass(self): print self
...   @classmethod
...   def withclass(cls): print cls
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = X()
&gt;&gt;&gt; x.noclass()
&lt;__main__.X object at 0x698d0&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; x.withclass()
&lt;class '__main__.X'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As you see, the instance method <code>noclass</code> gets the instance as its argument, but the class method <code>withclass</code> gets the class instead.</p>

<p>So it would be <strong>extremely</strong> confusing and misleading to use <code>self</code> as the name of the first parameter of a class method: the convention in this case is instead to use <code>cls</code>, as in my example above. While this IS just a convention, there is no real good reason for violating it -- any more than there would be, say, for naming a variable <code>number_of_cats</code> if the purpose of the variable is counting dogs!-)</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>The only case of this I've seen is when you define a function outside of a class definition, and then assign it to the class, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo(object):
    def bar(self):
        # Do something with 'self'

def baz(inst):
    return inst.bar()

Foo.baz = baz
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, <code>self</code> is a little strange to use, because the function could be applied to many classes. Most often I've seen <code>inst</code> or <code>cls</code> used instead.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I think that the main reason <code>self</code> is used by convention rather than being a Python keyword is because it's simpler to have all methods/functions take arguments the same way rather than having to put together different argument forms for functions, class methods, instance methods, etc.</p>

<p>Note that if you have an <em>actual</em> class method (i.e. one defined using the <code>classmethod</code> decorator), the convention is to use "cls" instead of "self".</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I once had some code like (and I apologize for lack of creativity in the example):</p>

<pre><code>class Animal:
    def __init__(self, volume=1):
        self.volume = volume
        self.description = "Animal"

    def Sound(self):
        pass

    def GetADog(self, newvolume):
        class Dog(Animal):
            def Sound(this):
                return self.description + ": " + ("woof" * this.volume)
        return Dog(newvolume)
</code></pre>

<p>Then we have output like:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = Animal(3)
&gt;&gt;&gt; d = a.GetADog(2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; d.Sound()
'Animal: woofwoof'
</code></pre>

<p>I wasn't sure if <code>self</code> within the <code>Dog</code> class would shadow <code>self</code> within the <code>Animal</code> class, so I opted to make <code>Dog</code>'s reference the word "this" instead.  In my opinion and for that particular application, that was more clear to me.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Because it is a convention, not language syntax. There is a <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow">Python style guide</a> that people who program in Python follow. This way libraries have a familiar look and feel. Python places a lot of emphasis on readability, and consistency is an important part of this.</p>
