<h3>Question (ID-1690605):</h3><h2>Reliable and efficient key--value database for Linux?</h2><p>I need a fast, reliable and memory-efficient key--value database for Linux. My keys are about 128 bytes, and the maximum value size can be 128K or 256K. The database subsystem shouldn't use more than about 1 MB of RAM. The total database size is 20G (!), but only a small random fraction of the data is accessed at a time. If necessary, I can move some data blobs out of the database (to regular files), so the size gets down to 2 GB maximum. The database must survive a system crash without any loss in recently unmodified data. I'll have about 100 times more reads than writes. It is a plus if it can use a block device (without a filesystem) as storage. I don't need client-server functionality, just a library. I need Python bindings (but I can implement them if they are not available).</p>

<p>Which solutions should I consider, and which one do you recommend?</p>

<p>Candidates I know of which could work:</p>

<br /><h3>Answers (Total-9):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I've had good luck with the Tokyo Cabinet/pytc solution. It's very fast (a bit faster than using the shelve module using anydbm in my implementation), both for reading and writing (though I too do far more reading). The problem for me was the spartan documentation on the python bindings, but there's enough example code around to figure out how to do what you need to do. Additionally, tokyo cabinet is quite easy to install (as are the python bindings), doesn't require a server (as you mention) and seems to be actively supported. You can open files in read-only mode, allowing concurrent access, or read/write mode, preventing other processes from accessing the database.</p>

<p>I was looking at various options over the summer, and the advice I got then was this: try out the different options and see what works best for you. It'd be nice if there were simply a "best" option, but everyone is looking for slightly different features and are willing to make different trade-offs. You know best.</p>

<p>(That said, it'd be useful to others if you shared what ended up working the best for you, and why you chose that solution over others!)</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>cdb can handle any database up to 4 GB, making it too small for the 20GB matter at hand.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>how about Python 3.0's dbm.ndbm ?</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Another suggestion is <a href="http://tdb.samba.org/" rel="nofollow">TDB</a> (a part of the Samba project). I've used it through the <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/tdb/1.0" rel="nofollow">tdb</a> module, however I can't say I've tested its reliability on crashes; the projects I used it in didn't have such requirements, and I can't find relevant documentation.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>how about a SQLite?</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I've used bsddb.hashlib() with Python, it worked pretty good.</p>
