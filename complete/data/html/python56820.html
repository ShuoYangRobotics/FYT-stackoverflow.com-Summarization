<h3>Question (ID-56820):</h3><h2>round() in Python doesn't seem to be rounding properly</h2><p>The documentation for the <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/built-in-funcs.html" rel="nofollow">round()</a> function states that you pass it a number, and the positions past the decimal to round. Thus is <em>should</em> do this:</p>

<pre><code>n = 5.59
round(n, 1) # 5.6
</code></pre>

<p>But, in actuality, good old floating point weirdness creeps in and you get:</p>

<pre><code>5.5999999999999996
</code></pre>

<p>For the purposes of UI, I need to display '5.6'. I poked around the Internet and found some <a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2005-September/340383.html" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> that this is dependent on my implementation of Python. Unfortunately, this occurs on both my Windows dev machine and each Linux server I've tried. <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.1/tut/node16.html" rel="nofollow">See here also</a>.</p>

<p>Short of creating my own round library, is there any way around this?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Ok, string formatting. Sometimes, it's just a really simple answer. Thanks everyone.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-10):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>can't help the way it's stored, but at least formatting works correctly: </p>

<pre><code>'%.1f' % round(n, 1) # gives you '5.6'
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><code>round(5.59, 1)</code> is working fine. The problem is that 5.6 cannot be represented exactly in binary floating point.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 5.6
5.5999999999999996
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As Vinko says, you can use string formatting to do rounding for display.</p>

<p>Python has a <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-decimal.html" rel="nofollow">module for decimal arithmetic</a> if you need that.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Formatting works correctly even without having to round:</p>

<pre><code>"%.1f" % n
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Floating point math is vulnerable to slight, but annoying, precision inaccuracies.  If you can work with integer or fixed point, you will be guaranteed precision.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You get '5.6' if you do <code>str(round(n, 1))</code> instead of just <code>round(n, 1)</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Take a look at the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/decimal.html" rel="nofollow">Decimal module</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Decimal “is based on a floating-point
  model which was designed with people
  in mind, and necessarily has a
  paramount guiding principle –
  computers must provide an arithmetic
  that works in the same way as the
  arithmetic that people learn at
  school.” – excerpt from the decimal
  arithmetic specification.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Decimal numbers can be represented
  exactly. In contrast, numbers like 1.1
  and 2.2 do not have an exact
  representations in binary floating
  point. End users typically would not
  expect 1.1 +  2.2 to display as
  3.3000000000000003  as it does with binary floating point.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Decimal provides the kind of operations that make it easy to write apps that require floating point operations and <em>also</em> need to present those results in a human readable format, e.g., accounting.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>You can use the string format operator <code>%</code>, similar to sprintf.</p>

<pre><code>mystring = "%.2f" % 5.5999
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>You can switch the data type to a integer:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; n = 5.59
&gt;&gt;&gt; int(n * 10) / 10.0
5.5
&gt;&gt;&gt; int(n * 10 + 0.5) 
56
</code></pre>

<p>And then display the number by inserting the locale's decimal separator.</p>

<p>However, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/56820/round-in-python-doesnt-seem-to-be-rounding-properly#56833" rel="nofollow">Jimmy's answer</a> is better.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p><strong>printf</strong> the sucker.</p>

<pre><code>print '%.1f' % 5.59  # returns 5.6
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>What about:</p>

<pre><code>round(n,1)+epsilon
</code></pre>
