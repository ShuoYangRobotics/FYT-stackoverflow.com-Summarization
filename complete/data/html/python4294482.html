<h3>Question (ID-4294482):</h3><h2>Python Multidimensional Arrays - most efficient way to count number of non-zero entries</h2><p>Hi there on a Saturday Fun Night,</p>

<p>I am getting around in python and I am quite enjoying it.</p>

<p>Assume I have a python array:</p>

<pre><code>x = [1, 0, 0, 1, 3]
</code></pre>

<p>What is the fastest way to count all non zero elements in the list (ans: 3) ?  Also I would like to do it <strong>without</strong> for loops if possible - the most succint and terse manner possibe, say something conceptually like</p>

<pre><code>[counter += 1 for y in x if y &gt; 0]
</code></pre>

<p>Now - my real problem is that I have a multi dimensional array and what I really want to avoid is doing the following:</p>

<pre><code>for p in range(BINS):
    for q in range(BINS):
        for r in range(BINS):
            if (mat3D[p][q][r] &gt; 0): some_feature_set_count += 1
</code></pre>

<p>From the little python I have seen, my gut feeling is that there is a really clean syntax (and efficient) way how to do this.</p>

<p>Ideas, anyone?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>For the single-dimensional case:</p>

<pre><code>sum(1 for i in x if i)
</code></pre>

<p>For the multi-dimensional case, you can either nest:</p>

<pre><code>sum(sum(1 for i in row if i) for row in rows)
</code></pre>

<p>or do it all within the one construct:</p>

<pre><code>sum(1 for row in rows
      for i in row if i)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>If you are using <code>numpy</code> as suggested by the fact that you're using multi-dimensional arrays in Python, the following is similar to @Marcelo's answer, but a tad cleaner:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = numpy.array([[1,2,3,0],[0,4,2,0]])
&gt;&gt;&gt; sum(1 for i in a.flat if i)
5
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>While perhaps not concise, this is my choice of how to solve this which works for any dimension:</p>

<pre><code>def sum(li):
  s = 0
  for l in li:
    if isinstance(l, list):
      s += sum(l)
    elif l:
      s += 1
  return s
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><pre><code>def zeros(n):
    return len(filter(lambda x:type(x)==int and x!=0,n))+sum(map(zeros,filter(lambda x:type(x)==list,n)))
</code></pre>

<p>Can't really say if it is the fastest way but it is recursive and works with N dimensional lists.</p>

<pre><code>zeros([1,2,3,4,0,[1,2,3,0,[1,2,3,0,0,0]]]) =&gt; 10
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I would have slightly changed Marcelo's answer to the following:</p>

<pre><code>len([x for x in my_list if x != 0])
</code></pre>

<p>The sum() above tricked me for a second, as I thought he was getting the total value instead of count until I seen the 1 hovering at the start. I'd rather be explicit with len().</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>If you go with numpy and your 3D array is a numpy array, this one-liner will do the trick:</p>

<p>numpy.where(your_array_name != 0, 1, 0).sum()</p>

<p>example:</p>

<p>In [23]: import numpy</p>

<p>In [24]: a = numpy.array([ [[0, 1, 2], [0, 0, 7], [9, 2, 0]], [[0, 0, 0], [1, 4, 6], [9, 0, 3]], [[1, 3, 2], [3, 4, 0], [1, 7, 9]] ])</p>

<p>In [25]: numpy.where(a != 0, 1, 0).sum()
Out[25]: 18</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Using chain to reduce array lookups:</p>

<pre><code>from itertools import chain
BINS = [[[2,2,2],[0,0,0],[1,2,0]],
        [[1,0,0],[0,0,2],[1,2,0]],
        [[0,0,0],[1,1,1],[1,3,0]]]
sum(1 for c in chain.from_iterable(chain.from_iterable(BINS)) if c &gt; 0)
14
</code></pre>

<p>I haven't done any performance checks on this. But it doesn't use any significant memory.
Note that it is using a generator expression, not a list comprehension.  Adding the [list comprehension] syntax will create an array to be summed instead of feeding one number at a time to sum.</p>
