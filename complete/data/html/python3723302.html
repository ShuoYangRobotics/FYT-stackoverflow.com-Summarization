<h3>Question (ID-3723302):</h3><h2>Is there a neater alternative to `except: pass`?</h2><p>I had a function that returned a random member of several groups in order of preference. It went something like this:</p>

<pre><code>def get_random_foo_or_bar():
    "I'd rather have a foo than a bar."

    if there_are_foos():
        return get_random_foo()

    if there_are_bars():
        return get_random_bar()

    raise IndexError, "No foos, no bars"
</code></pre>

<p>However, the first thing <code>get_random_foo</code> does is verify there are foos and raise an <code>IndexError</code> if not, so <code>there_are_foos</code> is redundant. Moreover, a database is involved and using separate functions creates a concurrency issue. Accordingly, I rewrote it something like this:</p>

<pre><code>def get_random_foo_or_bar():
    "Still prefer foos."

    try:
        return get_random_foo()
    except IndexError:
        pass

    try:
        return get_random_bar()
    except IndexError:
        pass

    raise IndexError, "No foos, no bars"
</code></pre>

<p>But I find this much less readable, and as I've never had reason to use <code>pass</code> before it feels instictively wrong.</p>

<p>Is there a neater efficient pattern, or should I learn to accept <code>pass</code>?</p>

<p>Note: I'd like to avoid any nesting since other types may be added later.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>Thanks everyone who said that <code>pass</code> is fine - that's reassuring!</p>

<p>Also thanks to those who suggested replacing the exception with a return value of <code>None</code>. I can see how this is a useful pattern, but I would argue it's semantically wrong in this situation: the functions have been asked to perform an impossible task so they should raise an exception. I prefer to follow the behaviour of the <code>random</code> module (eg. <code>random.choice([])</code>).</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>That is exactly how I would write it. It's simple and it makes sense. I see no problem with the <code>pass</code> statements.</p>

<p>If you want to reduce the repetition and you anticipate adding future types, you could roll this up into a loop. Then you could change the <code>pass</code> to a functionally-equivalent <code>continue</code> statement, if that's more pleasing to your eyes:</p>

<pre><code>for getter in (get_random_foo, get_random_bar):
    try:
        return getter()
    except IndexError:
        continue  # Ignore the exception and try the next type.

raise IndexError, "No foos, no bars"
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><code>pass</code> is fine (there's a <em>reason</em> it's in the language!-), but a pass-free alternative just takes a bit more nesting:</p>

<pre><code>try: return get_random_foo()
except IndexError:
    try: return get_random_bar()
    except IndexError:
        raise IndexError "no foos, no bars"
</code></pre>

<p>Python's Zen (<code>import this</code> from the interactive interpreter prompt) says "flat is better than nested", but nesting is <em>also</em> in the language, for you to use when you decide (presumably being enlightened) that you can do better than that wise koan!-)  (As in, "if you meet the Buddha on the road"...).</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>It looks a little weird to me that <code>get_random_foo()</code> is raising an IndexError when it doesn't take an index as a param (but it might make more sense in context). Why not have <code>get_random_foo()</code>, or a wrapper, catch the error and return None instead?</p>

<pre><code>def get_random_foo_wrapper():
    try:
        return get_random_foo()
    except IndexError:
        return None

def get_random_foo_or_bar():
    "I'd rather have a foo than a bar."

    return get_random_foo_wrapper() or get_random_bar_wrapper() or None
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I should mention that if foo &amp; bar are objects that may evaluate to False (0 or '' say) then the <code>or</code> comparison will skip over them which is BAD</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>If it's just those two, could always just...</p>

<pre><code>try:
    return get_random_foo()
except IndexError:
    try:
        return get_random_bar()
    except IndexError:
        raise IndexError, "No foos, no bars"
</code></pre>

<p>If it's more than two, what you have written seems perfectly acceptable.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Building on Peter Gibson's suggestion, you could create a generic wrapper function that swallows a given exception. And then you could write a function that <em>returns</em> such a generic wrapper for a provided exception. Or heck, for a provided <em>list</em> of exceptions.</p>

<pre><code>def maketrap(*exceptions):
    def trap(func, *args, **kwargs):
        try:
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        except exceptions:
            return None
    return trap

def get_random_foo_or_bar():
    mytrap = maketrap(IndexError)
    return mytrap(get_random_foo) or mytrap(get_random_bar) or None
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>If you don't really need the exception message (just the type):</p>

<pre><code>def get_random_foo_or_bar():
    try:
        return get_random_foo()
    except IndexError:
        return get_random_bar()    # if failing at this point,
                                   # the whole function will raise IndexError
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Is it necessary that get_random_foo/bar() raise an IndexError if it's unable to succeed?</p>

<p>If they returned None, you could do:</p>

<pre><code>def get_random_foo_or_bar():
    return get_random_foo() or get_random_bar()
</code></pre>
