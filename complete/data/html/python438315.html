<h3>Question (ID-438315):</h3><h2>Is there a pure Python Lucene?</h2><p>The ruby folks have <a href="http://ferret.davebalmain.com/" rel="nofollow">Ferret</a>. Someone know of any similar initiative for Python? We're using PyLucene at current, but I'd like to investigate moving to pure Python searching.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The only one pure-python (not involving even C extension) search solution I know of is <a href="http://nucular.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">Nucular</a>. It's slow (much slower than PyLucene) and unstable yet.</p>

<p>We moved from PyLucene-based home baked search and indexing to <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/" rel="nofollow">Solr</a> but YMMV.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I recently found <a href="http://swapoff.org/pyndexter" rel="nofollow">pyndexter</a>. It provides abstract interface to various different backend full-text search engines/indexers. And it ships with a default pure-python implementation.</p>

<p>These things can be disastrously slow though in Python.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>For some applications pure Python is overrated. Take a look at Xapian.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>+1 to the Xapian and Pyndexter answers.</p>

<p>Ferret is actually written in C with Ruby bindings on top.  A pure Ruby search engine would be even slower than a pure Python one.  I would love to see "someone else" write a Cython/Pyrex layer for Python interface to Ferret, but won't do it myself because why bother when there are Python bindings for Xapian.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=76541&amp;package_id=77267" rel="nofollow">lupy</a> was a lucene port to pure python.<a href="http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/WhitherLupy" rel="nofollow">The lupy people suggest that you use PyLucene</a>. Sorry. Maybe you can use the Java sources in combination with <a href="http://www.jython.org/Project/" rel="nofollow">Jython</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>After weeks of searching for this, I found a nice Python solution: <a href="http://static.repoze.org/catalogdocs/" rel="nofollow">repoze.catalog</a>. It's not strictly Python-only because it uses ZODB for storage, but it seems a better dependency to me than something like SOLR.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>For non-pure Python, Sphinx Search with Python API work is the fastest. From the bench marks from multiple blogs . Sphinxsearch is way faster than , way less memory usage then Lucence and it is in C.</p>

<p>I am developing a multi-document searchengine base on it, using python and web2py as framework </p>
