<p>If you're at Google IO, I'll be talking about this at 1pm tomorrow (on the APIs track): <a href="http://code.google.com/events/io/2010/sessions/building-real-time-apps-app-engine-feed-api.html" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/events/io/2010/sessions/building-real-time-apps-app-engine-feed-api.html</a></p>

<p>Here's the YouTube video of the session: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMXe-xK0BWA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMXe-xK0BWA</a></p>

<p>Hopefully last update! This is now released: code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/channel</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>At this time, I would rule out doing Comet in App Engine (any language). Comet is based on long-lived HTTP connections, and App Engine will time out any single connection in about 30 seconds or so at most; it's hard to conceive of a worse match!</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I found this article which explains a sort of comet. It is not really but you can simulate realtime with it. It uses an external service</p>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Comet (or something like it - XMPP API) is on the google app engine roadmap.  For now, stay away.</p>

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I would have commented on Moishe's answer , however my reputation doesn't seem to allow that... Here's that video to the Google I/O talk that describes the Channel API (only available to trusted developers for the moment, soon to be out)</p>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>30 seconds is more than enough; either way you should return a no-op message when a time passed and no new events occur.</p>

<p>This prevents client timeouts and is done by everybody who does comet.</p>

<p>Just send the request, and on the server make it wait until an event or timeout after 25 seconds.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Looking inside the App Engine 1.3.8-pre release, I see the Channel API service stub and more code. So it looks like we can start trying it out locally.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Google App Engine supports server push using the Channel API since 2nd December.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>This is not a simple question to answer. Reading <a href="http://ajaxpatterns.org/Comet" rel="nofollow">this wiki</a> might give you a hint as to the implementation you'd like to undertake. You might have to write the HTTP server yourself to implement sockets which remain open.</p>
