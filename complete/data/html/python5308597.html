<h3>Question (ID-5308597):</h3><h2>Good programming guide for a middleschooler</h2><p>I hope that this forum is the right place to ask this question!</p>

<p>I am a teacher at a combined middle/high school and one of the eighth graders is interested in teaching himself some programming.</p>

<p>I've recommended Python as an introductory language. I have struggled to find any programming guides, however, that are accessible (from a language and tone perspective) to an eighth grader.</p>

<p>Are there any guides that you can recommend?</p>

<p>It is free and aimed at beginner programmers. In my opinion - the best choice for your students.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I think Python is an excellent choice for students who are completely new to programming.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.livewires.org.uk/python/home" rel="nofollow">Livewires tutorials</a> are written specifically for middle schoolers.</p>

<p>And C would be the <em>last</em> language I would start anyone on.</p>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p><a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/index" rel="nofollow">Learn Python the Hard Way</a> is (ironically) very accessible and beginner-friendly. 'Hard Way' in this case refers to huge amounts of typing, which is a great way to learn.</p>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>i started with C at university without any knowledge of programming or whatever, i am sure he is better than the times i was a freshman.</p>

<p>but the important point of programming is not the language for the beginning, it is the understanding of solving a problem</p>

<p>teach him writing an algorithm then suggest C/Python whatever he can find his own path after learning about algorithms</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p><a href="http://diveintopython3.org" rel="nofollow">DiveIntoPython3</a> is a good resource; it does a good job of providing background info as it introduces new topics. There's also <a href="http://diveintopython.org/" rel="nofollow">DiveIntoPython</a> which refers to Python 2.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> After perusing some other Q&amp;A on the site, I've found some users who recommend DIP/DIP3 and some who do not, so YMMV. </p>

<p>However, that brings up the point that Stack Overflow itself is a good way to find specific resources. Below I list a two questions that should help you to find Python resources (most answers specify beginner/intermediate/expert). Hope it helps.</p>

<p>Also, a lot of answers seem to point here:</p>
