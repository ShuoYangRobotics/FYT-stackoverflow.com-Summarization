<h3>Question (ID-1779287):</h3><h2>Small "embeddable" database that can also be synced over the network?</h2><p>I am looking for a small database that can be "embedded" into my Python application without running a separate server, as one can do with <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/" rel="nofollow">SQLite</a> or <a href="http://www.equi4.com/metakit/" rel="nofollow">Metakit</a>. I don't need an SQL database, in fact storing free-form data like Python dictionaries or JSON is preferable. </p>

<p>The other requirement is that to be able to run an instance of the database on a server, and have instances of my application (clients) sync the database with the server (two-way), similar to what <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/" rel="nofollow">CouchDB</a>  replication can do. </p>

<p>Is there a database that will do this?  </p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>If you don't need an SQL database, what's wrong with CouchDB? You can spawn a local process to serve the DB, and you could easily write a server wrapper to allow only access from your app. I'm not sure about the access story, but I believe the latest Ubuntu uses CouchDB for synchronizeable user-level data.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Seems like the perfect job for CouchDB: 2 way sync is incredibly easy, schema-less JSON documents are the native format. If you're using python, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/couchdb-python/" rel="nofollow">couchdb-python</a> is a great way to work with CouchDB.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Do you need clients to work offline and then resync when they reconnect to the network? I don't know if <a href="http://mongodb.org" rel="nofollow">MongoDB</a> can handle the offline client scenario, but if the client is online all the time, MongoDB might be a good solution too. It has pretty goode python <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Python+Language+Center" rel="nofollow">support</a>. Still a separate process, but perhaps easier to get running on Windows than CouchDB.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>BerkeleyDB might be another option to check out, and it's lightweight enough. easy_install bsddb3 if you need a Python interface.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p><a href="http://hsqldb.org" rel="nofollow">HSQLDB</a> does this, but unfortunately it's Java rather than Python.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.firebirdsql.org/" rel="nofollow">Firebird SQL</a> might be closer to what you want, since it does seem to have a Python interface.</p>
