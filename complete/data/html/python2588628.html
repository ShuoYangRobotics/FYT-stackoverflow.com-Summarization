<h3>Question (ID-2588628):</h3><h2>What is the purpose of subclassing the class "object" in Python?</h2><p>All the Python built-ins are subclasses of <code>object</code> and I come across many user-defined classes which are too. Why? What is the purpose of the class <code>object</code>? It's just an empty class, right?</p>

<p>In long, Python 2.2 and earlier used "old style classes". They were a particular implementation of classes, and they had a few limitations (for example, you couldn't subclass builtin types). The fix for this was to create a new style of class. But, doing this would involve some backwards-incompatible changes. So, to make sure that code which is written for old style classes will still work, the <code>object</code> class was created to act as a superclass for all new-style classes.
So, in Python 2.X, <code>class Foo: pass</code> will create an old-style class and <code>class Foo(object): pass</code> will create a new style class.</p>

<p>In longer, see Guido's <a href="http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.2.3/descrintro/" rel="nofollow"><em>Unifying types and classes in Python 2.2</em></a>.</p>

<p>And, in general, it's a good idea to get into the habit of making all your classes new-style, because some things (the <code>@property</code> decorator is one that comes to mind) won't work with old-style classes.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>It has to do with the "new-style" of classes.  You can read more about it here: <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/classes.html#multiple-inheritance" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/tutorial/classes.html#multiple-inheritance</a> and also here: <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html#new-style-and-classic-classes" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html#new-style-and-classic-classes</a></p>

<p>Using new-style classes will allow you to use "Python's newer, versatile features like _<em>slots</em>_, descriptors, properties, and _<em>getattribute</em>_()."</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Right, but it marks the class as a <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/newstyle/" rel="nofollow">new-style</a> class. Newly developed classes should use the <code>object</code> base because it costs little and future-proofs your code.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Short answer: subclassing <code>object</code> effectively makes it a <em>new-style</em> class (note that this is unnecessary since automatic in Python 3.x)</p>

<p>For the difference between <code>new style</code> classes and <code>old style</code> classes: see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/54867/old-style-and-new-style-classes-in-python">this stackoverflow question</a>. For the complete story: see <a href="http://www.cafepy.com/article/python_types_and_objects/python_types_and_objects.html" rel="nofollow">this nice writeup on Python Types and Objects</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>The short version is that classic classes, which didn't need a superclass, had limitations that couldn't be worked around without breaking a lot of old code.  So they created the concept of new-style classes which subclass from <code>object</code>, and now you can do cool things like define properties, and subclassing <code>dict</code> is no longer an exercise in pain and strange bugs.</p>

<p>The details are in section 3.3 of the Python docs: <a href="http://docs.python.org/release/2.5.2/ref/node33.html" rel="nofollow">New-style and classic classes.</a></p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p><a href="http://docs.python.org/dev/whatsnew/2.2.html#old-and-new-classes" rel="nofollow">Python 2.2 introduced "new style classes"</a> which had a number of additional features relative to the old style classes which did not subclass object.  Subclasses object was the chosen way to indicate that your class should be a new style class, not an old style one.</p>
