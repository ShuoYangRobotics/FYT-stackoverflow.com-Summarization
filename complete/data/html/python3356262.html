<h3>Question (ID-3356262):</h3><h2>is it bad convention to call sys.argv from somewhere besides main function in python</h2><p>I am writing a script and I have a function, call it <code>f()</code>, that needs one of the command line arguments (a filename it needs to open). However, <code>f()</code> is not called directly in the main function. </p>

<p>I was wondering if it was bad coding convention to call <code>sys.argv[1]</code> straight from <code>f()</code>? If I don't I would have to pass it as an argument to all of the functions that eventually call <code>f()</code>. </p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>It would be a bad practice to always assume that the arguments that your function needs are available on the command-line - what if this code was invoked in some other manner?</p>

<p>A function should declare input parameters for the data it needs to access.</p>

<p>At the very least, passing the necessary argument into <code>f()</code> rather than accessing <code>sys.argv</code> helps make <code>f()</code> much more re-usable.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>It is bad form to access <code>sys.argv</code> from anywhere other than your main routine since it couples that code to the command line, making it difficult to use from other Python scripts.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You should pass the file name into <code>f()</code>. This way, if you want to use that function later (as a module function, perhaps), you aren't bound to use <code>sys.argv</code>.</p>

<p>You could always make a wrapper to <code>f()</code> (if you are lazy or want to keep your 'main' code clean), that does something like:</p>

<pre><code>def wrapperf():
    return f(sys.argv[1])
</code></pre>

<p>You could define <code>wrapperf</code> inside of <code>main()</code> if you want to keep it away from other scripts importing your module.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Yes, it would be bad practice to access sys.argv from f.</p>

<p>I would  suggest passing the neccessary arguments into f. But since f won't neccessarily be called from main...maybe use a global variable? I normally try to avoid them, but in your case... >.></p>

<p>I guess it would help to know a little more info about the way the program is setup. :P</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I would recommend setting the file name once, from sys.argv[1] if it exists, or demand user input if it doesn't.  Then store it as part of an object, or a global variable.  That will prevent having to pass what is essentially a static string all over the place, once it is set.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You definitely don't want to parse sys.argv in some low-level function. To avoid lots of parameter-passing, you could provide a helper-function called by <code>main()</code> that simply stores the filename into a static variable for later use by <code>f()</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I would generally advise against it, but BaseHttpServer in python actually uses sys.argv[1] to determine which port to listen on. Convenience maybe.</p>
