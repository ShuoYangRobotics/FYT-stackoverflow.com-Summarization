<h3>Question (ID-1938614):</h3><h2>In what case would I use a tuple as a dictionary key?</h2><p>I was studying the <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/faq/general/#why-are-there-separate-tuple-and-list-data-types" rel="nofollow">difference between lists and tuples</a> (in Python). An obvious one is that tuples are immutable (the values cannot be changed after initial assignment), while lists are mutable.</p>

<p>A sentence in the article got me: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Only immutable elements can be used as
  dictionary keys, and hence only tuples
  and not lists can be used as keys.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have a hard time thinking of a situation where I would like to use a tuple as a dictionary key. Can you provide an example problem where this would be the natural, efficient, elegant, or obvious solution?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>Thanks for your examples. So far I take that a very important application is the caching of function values.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Classic Example: You want to store point value as tuple of  (x, y) </p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><pre><code>salaries = {}
salaries[('John', 'Smith')] = 10000.0
salaries[('John', 'Parker')] = 99999.0
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT 1</strong>
Of course you can do <code>salaries['John Smith'] = whatever</code>, but then you'll have to do extra work to separate the key into first and last names. What about <code>pointColor[(x, y, z)] = "red"</code>, here the benefit of tuple key is more prominent. </p>

<p>I must stress out that this is not the best practice. In many cases you better create special classes to handle situations like that, but Arrieta asked for examples, which I gave her (him).</p>

<p>By the way, each tuple element has to be hashable too:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; d = {}
&gt;&gt;&gt; t = (range(3), range(10, 13))
&gt;&gt;&gt; d[t] = 11
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: list objects are unhashable
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I use tuple lots of time as dict key e.g.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I do use them when I have to create a unique key from multiple values e.g.</p>

<p>based on first_name, last_name key could be key = '%s_%s'%(first_name, last_name) but better way is key = (first_name, last_name) because </p>

<ol>
<li>It is more readable, shorter and less computation</li>
<li>It is easier to retrieve the individual values</li>
<li>Most importantly key = '%s_%s'%(first_name, last_name) is wrong and may not give unique keys for all values of first_name and last_name e.g. when values contain _</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Caching the results of a function </p>

<p>def func(a1, b1):
    if (a1,b1) in cache: return cache[(a1,b1)]
    ...</p></li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I used tuples as dictionary keys in application that compares network devices by geographical location.  Since the devices are named similarly for each location, it provides a natural way to know if a device matching that pairing has been seen yet while processing multiples.</p>

<p>i.e.</p>

<pre><code>seen = {}
seen[('abc', 'lax')] = 1
seen[('xyz', 'nyc')] = 1
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><pre><code>a[("John", "Doe")] = "123 Fake Street"
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I suppose in the case of sorting, there could be merit in using a tuple.  For example, suppose the dictionary key represents a sort field (obviously there would be a default sort field to prevent the key from being <code>None</code>).  If you needed multiple sort fields, such as the case of sorting by last name, then first name, wouldn't using a tuple as the dictionary key be a good idea?</p>

<p>Sure, such an idea might have limited use, but that doesn't mean it is completely useless.</p>
