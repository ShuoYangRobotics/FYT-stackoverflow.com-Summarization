<h3>Question (ID-8420705):</h3><h2>Example use of "continue" statement in Python?</h2><p>The definition of the continue statement is: "The continue statement continues with the next iteration of the loop." I can't find any good example of code. </p>

<p>Could someone suggest some simple cases where "continue" is necessary? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I like to use continue in loops where there are a lot of contitions to be fulfilled before you get "down to business". So instead of code like this:</p>

<pre><code>for x, y in zip(a, b):
    if x &gt; y:
        z = calculate_z(x, y)
        if y - z &lt; x:
            y = min(y, z)
            if x ** 2 - y ** 2 &gt; 0:
                lots()
                of()
                code()
                here()
</code></pre>

<p>I get code like this:</p>

<pre><code>for x, y in zip(a, b):
    if x &lt;= y:
        continue
    z = calculate_z(x, y)
    if y - z &gt;= x:
        continue
    y = min(y, z)
    if x ** 2 - y ** 2 &lt;= 0:
        continue
    lots()
    of()
    code()
    here()
</code></pre>

<p>By doing it this way I avoid very deeply nested code. Also, it is easy to optimize the loop by eliminating the most frequently occurring cases first, so that I only have to deal with the infrequent but important cases (e.g. divisor is 0) when there is no other showstopper.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Usually the situation where continue is necessary/useful, is when you want to skip the remaining code in the loop and continue iteration.</p>

<p>I don't really believe it's necessary, since you can always use if statements to provide the same logic, but it might be useful to increase readability of code.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><pre><code>def filter_out_colors(elements):
  colors = ['red', 'green']
  result = []
  for element in elements:
    if element in colors:
       continue # skip the element
    # You can do whatever here
    result.append(element)
  return result

  &gt;&gt;&gt; filter_out_colors(['lemon', 'orange', 'red', 'pear'])
  ['lemon', 'orange', 'pear']

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You might find that using continue makes your code cleaner when you need to handle a case where you need to skip the rest of the loop.</p>

<p>Here's a slighly cleaned up example from some code I've written recently:</p>

<pre><code>watchdirs = ['/some/nfs/directory1',
             '/some/nfs/directory2']

for dir in watchdirs:
    try:
        os.listdir(dir)
    except OSError:
        print "mount not available: %s\nskipping it for now" % (dir)
        continue
</code></pre>

<p>Usually you can achieve the same result with an If block wrapping parts of the loop body, but I think this reads better.</p>

<p>I have changed the code a bit to include the <code>continue</code> statement. This will also help you understand how we can easily circumvent the usage.</p>

<pre><code>def Test():
    fin1=open("file1.txt") #File as per your First Table
    fin2=open("file2.txt") #File as per your Second Table
    fin1.readline()        #Skip the Header
    fin2.readline()        #Skip the Header
    #Sort The First list and create an Iterator
    data1=iter(sorted([[f.split()[1],f.split()[2],f.split()[0]] 
               for f in fin1.xreadlines()],key=operator.itemgetter(0))) 
    #Sort The Second List and create an Iterator
    data2=iter(sorted([f.split() for f in fin2.xreadlines()],
               key=operator.itemgetter(0))) 
    # Print The Header
    print "{0:10}{1:10}{2:10}{3:10}{4:10}{5:10}".format("gene_id",
                                                         "start",
                                                         "stop",
                                                         "position",

                                                         "support")
    try:
        v1=data1.next() #Read First Item from First List
        v2=data2.next() #Read Second Item from First List
        #Loop Until One of the List has reached the end
        while True: 
            if v2[0] &gt; v1[1]:
                #If the Position is greater than stop range (from first list)
                #read the next item from the first list
                v1=data1.next()
                continue # Example of Continue
            # If the Position is greater or equal than the start range 
            # (We are in the range)
            if v2[0] &gt;= v1[0]: 
                #Format and Print it
                print "{0:10}{1:10}{2:10}{3:10}{4:10}{5:10}".format(v1[2],
                                                                    v1[0],
                                                                    v1[1],

            v2=data2.next() 
    except StopIteration:
        None

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>For example if you want to do diferent things depending on the value of a variable:</p>

<pre><code>for items in range(0,100):
    if my_var &lt; 10:
        continue
    elif my_var == 10:
        print("hit")
    elif my_var &gt; 10:
        print("passed")
    my_var = my_var + 1
</code></pre>

<p>In the example above if I use <code>break</code> the interpreter will skip the loop. But with <code>continue</code>it only skips the if-elif statements and go directly to the next item of the loop.</p>
