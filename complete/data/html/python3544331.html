<h3>Question (ID-3544331):</h3><h2>Quickly find differences between two large text files</h2><p>I have two 3GB text files, each file has around 80 million lines. And they share 99.9% identical lines (file A has 60,000 unique lines, file B has 80,000 unique lines).</p>

<p>How can I quickly find those unique lines in two files? Is there any ready-to-use command line tools for this? I'm using Python but I guess it's less possible to find a efficient Pythonic method to load the files and compare.</p>

<p>Any suggestions are appreciated.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>With 60,000 or 80,000 unique lines you could just create a dictionary for each unique line, mapping it to a number. <code>mydict["hello world"] =&gt; 1</code>, etc. If your average line is around 40-80 characters this will be in the neighborhood of 10 MB of memory.</p>

<p>Then read each file, converting it to an array of numbers via the dictionary. Those will fit easily in memory (2 files of 8 bytes * 3GB / 60k lines is less than 1 MB of memory). Then diff the lists. You could <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/483666/python-reverse-inverse-a-mapping">invert the dictionary</a> and use it to print out the text of the lines that differ.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>In response to your comment, here's a sample script that assigns numbers to unique lines as it reads from a file.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python

class Reader:

    def __init__(self, file):
        self.count = 0
        self.dict = {}
        self.file = file

    def readline(self):
        line = self.file.readline()
        if not line:
            return None
        if self.dict.has_key(line):
            return self.dict[line]
        else:
            self.count = self.count + 1
            self.dict[line] = self.count
            return self.count

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print "Type Ctrl-D to quit."
    import sys
    r = Reader(sys.stdin)
    result = 'ignore'
    while result:
        result = r.readline()
        print result

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I think this is the fastest method (whether it's in Python or another language shouldn't matter too much IMO). </p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<p>1.I only store each line's hash to save space (and time if paging might occur)</p>

<p>2.Because of the above, I only print out line numbers; if you need actual lines, you'd just need to read the files in again</p>

<p>3.I assume that the hash function results in no conflicts. This is nearly, but not perfectly, certain.</p>

<p>4.I import hashlib because the built-in hash() function is too short to avoid conflicts.</p>

<pre><code>import sys
import hashlib

file = []
lines = []
for i in range(2):
    # open the files named in the command line
    file.append(open(sys.argv[1+i], 'r'))
    # stores the hash value and the line number for each line in file i
    lines.append({})
    # assuming you like counting lines starting with 1
    counter = 1
    while 1:
        # assuming default encoding is sufficient to handle the input file
        line = file[i].readline().encode()
        if not line: break
        hashcode = hashlib.sha512(line).hexdigest()
        lines[i][hashcode] = sys.argv[1+i]+': '+str(counter)
        counter += 1
unique0 = lines[0].keys() - lines[1].keys()
unique1 = lines[1].keys() - lines[0].keys()
result = [lines[0][x] for x in unique0] + [lines[1][x] for x in unique1]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>If I understand correctly, you want the lines of these files without duplicates. This does the job:</p>

<pre><code>uniqA = set(open('fileA', 'r'))
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.emeditor.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.emeditor.com/</a> can handle large files and can also compare them.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Python has difflib which claims to be quite competitive with other diff utilities see:
