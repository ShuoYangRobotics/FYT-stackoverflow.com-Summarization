<h3>Question (ID-2233388):</h3><h2>How to delete list elements while cycling the list itself without duplicate it</h2><p>I lost a little bit of time in this Python for statement:</p>

<pre><code>class MyListContainer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.list = []

    def purge(self):
        for object in self.list:
            if (object.my_cond()):
                self.list.remove(object)
        return self.list

container = MyListContainer()

# now suppose both obj.my_cond() return True
obj1 = MyCustomObject(par)
obj2 = MyCustomObject(other_par)

container.list = [obj1, obj2]

# returning not an empty list but [obj2]
container.purge()
</code></pre>

<p>It doesn't work as I expected because when the cycle in "purge" delete the first object in list the second one is shifted to the beginning of the list and the cycle is ended.</p>

<p>I solved duplicating self.list before the for cycle:</p>

<pre><code>...
local_list = self.list[:]
for object in local_list:
...
</code></pre>

<p>I suppose that the for statement stop working because I'm changing the length of the original list. Can someone clarify this point ? </p>

<p>And is there a more "elegant" way to solve this problem ? If I have more than few elements inside the list, duplicating it every time does not seem a good idea.</p>

<p>Maybe the filter() function is the right one but i whish to have some other approach if any. </p>

<p>I'm a newbie.</p>

<p>To summarize your useful answers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Never edit a list you are looping</li>
<li>Duplicate the list or use list comprehensions</li>
<li>Duplicating a list could not waste your memory or in this case who's mind about it</li>
</ul>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Don't try. Just don't. Make a copy or generate a new list.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Just make yourself a new list:</p>

<pre><code>def purge(self):
    self.list = [object for object in self.list if not object.my_cond()]
    return self.list
</code></pre>

<p>Reserve any optimization until you've profiled and found that this method really is the bottleneck of your application. (I bet it won't be.)</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>In python variables are actually labels to data. Duplicating a list is, for the most part, making a new set of pointers to the data from the first list. Don't feel too bad about it.</p>

<p>List comprehensions are your friend.</p>

<p>e.g.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = range(20)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]
&gt;&gt;&gt; [ x for x in a if x % 2 == 0 ]
[0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Filter (or list comprehension) IS the way to go. If you want to do it inplace, something like this would work:</p>

<pre><code>purge = []
for i,object in enumerate(self.list):
    if object.mycond()
        purge.append(i)
for i in reversed(purge):
    del self.list[i]
</code></pre>

<p>Or alternatively, the purge list can be made with a comprehension, a shortcut version looks like:</p>

<pre><code>for i in reversed([ i for (i,o) in enumerate(self.list) if o.mycond() ]):
    del self.list[i]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Your second solution in which you duplicate the list is the right way to go. Afterward you can just replace the old list with the duplicate if need be.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>It's perfectly safe to shorten the list in place if you do it in reverse!</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a=range(20)
&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in reversed(range(len(a))):
...     if a[i]%2: del a[i]
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
[0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]
</code></pre>

<p>Another way is to reassign the whole slice</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a=range(20)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[:]=(x for x in a if not x%2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
[0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]
</code></pre>

<p>If the items in the list are unique, this works too</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a=range(20)
&gt;&gt;&gt; for item in reversed(a):
...  if item%2: a.remove(item)
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
[0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]
</code></pre>

<p>Here is some more explanation in response to yuri's comment</p>

<p>Suppose we have</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a=[0,1,2,3,4,5]
</code></pre>

<p>Now trying naively to delete the 3rd and 4th items</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; del a[3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; del a[4]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
[0, 1, 2, 4] # didn't work because the position of all the item with index &gt;=3 was changed
</code></pre>

<p>However if we do the <code>del</code>'s in the opposite order</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a=[0,1,2,3,4,5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; del a[4]
&gt;&gt;&gt; del a[3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
[0, 1, 2, 5] # this is the desired result
</code></pre>

<p>Now extend that idea over a for loop with a removal condition, and you see that removal from the live list is possible</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><pre><code>indeces = []
minus = 0

for i in range(self.list):
    if cond(self.list[i]):
        indeces.append(i)

for i in indeces:
    self.list = self.list[:(i-minus)].extend(self.list[i-minus+1:])
</code></pre>
