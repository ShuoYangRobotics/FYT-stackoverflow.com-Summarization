<h3>Question (ID-493367):</h3><h2>Python: For each list element apply a function across the list</h2><p>Given [1,2,3,4,5], how can i do something like 1/1, 1/2, 1/3,1/4,1/5, ...., 3/1,3/2,3/3,3/4,3/5,.... 5/1,5/2,5/3,5/4,5/5</p>

<p>I would like to store all the results, find the minimum, and return the two numbers used to find the minimum. So in the case i've described above i would like to return (1,5).</p>

<p>So basically I would like to do something like</p>

<p>for each element i in the list
map some function across all elements in the list, taking i and j as parameters
store the result in a master list, find the minimum value in the master list, and return the arguments i, j used to calculate this minimum value.</p>

<p>In my real problem i have a list objects/coordinates, and the function I am using takes two coordinates and calculates the euclidean distance. I'm trying to find minimum euclidean distance between any two points but I don't need a fancy algorithm.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; [(x,y) for x in nums for y in nums]
[(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)]
&gt;&gt;&gt; min(_, key=lambda pair: pair[0]/pair[1])
(1, 5)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that to run this on Python 2.5 you'll need to either make one of the arguments a float, or do <code>from __future__ import division</code> so that 1/5 correctly equals 0.2 instead of 0.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>If I'm correct in thinking that you want to find the minimum value of a function for all possible pairs of 2 elements from a list...</p>

<pre><code>l = [1,2,3,4,5]

def f(i,j):
   return i+j 

# Prints min value of f(i,j) along with i and j
print min( (f(i,j),i,j) for i in l for j in l)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If you don't mind importing the numpy package, it has a lot of convenient functionality built in.  It's likely to be much more efficient to use their data structures than lists of lists and the like.</p>

<pre><code>from __future__ import division

import numpy

data = numpy.asarray([1,2,3,4,5])
dists = data.reshape((1,5)) / data.reshape((5,1))

print dists

which = dists.argmin()
(r,c) = (which // 5, which % 5) # assumes C ordering

# pick whichever is most appropriate for you...
minval = dists[r,c]
minval = dists.min()
minval = dists.ravel()[which]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Try <a href="http://en.literateprograms.org/Generating_all_integer_lattice_points_(Python)" rel="nofollow">this resource</a></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Doing it the mathy way...</p>

<pre><code>nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
min_combo = (min(nums), max(nums))
</code></pre>

<p>Unless, of course, you have negatives in there.  In that case, this won't work because you actually want the min and max absolute values - the numerator should be close to zero, and the denominator far from it, in either direction.  And double negatives would break it.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>If working with Python â‰¥2.6 (including 3.x), you can:</p>

<pre><code>from __future__ import division
import operator, itertools

def getmin(alist):
    return min(
        (operator.div(*pair), pair)
        for pair in itertools.product(alist, repeat=2)
    )[1]

getmin([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: Now that I think of it and if I remember my mathematics correctly, this should also give the answer assuming that all numbers are non-negative:</p>

<pre><code>def getmin(alist):
    return min(alist), max(alist)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Some readable python:</p>

<pre><code>def JoeCalimar(l):
    masterList = []
    for i in l:
        for j in l:
            masterList.append(1.*i/j)
    pos = masterList.index(min(masterList))
    a = pos/len(masterList)
    b = pos%len(masterList)
    return (l[a],l[b])
</code></pre>

<p>Let me know if something is not clear.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</code></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; min(map((lambda t: ((float(t[0])/t[1]), t)), ((x, y) for x in nums for y in nums)))[1]</code></p>

<p><code>(1, 5)</code></p>
