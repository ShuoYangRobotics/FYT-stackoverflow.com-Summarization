<h3>Question (ID-3531746):</h3><h2>What’s a good Python profanity filter library?</h2><p>Like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1521646/best-profanity-filter">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1521646/best-profanity-filter</a>, but for Python — and I’m looking for libraries I can run and control myself locally, as opposed to web services.</p>

<p>(And whilst it’s always great to hear your fundamental objections of principle to profanity filtering, I’m not specifically looking for them here. I know profanity filtering can’t pick up every hurtful thing being said. I know swearing, in the grand scheme of things, isn’t a particularly big issue. I know you need some human input to deal with issues of content. I’d just like to find a good library, and see what use I can make of it.)</p>

<h2>Parameters</h2>

<hr>

<h3><code>filterlist</code></h3>

<p>A list of regular expressions that match a forbidden word. Please do not use <code>\b</code>, it will be inserted depending on <code>inside_words</code>.</p>

<p>Example:
 <code>['bad', 'un\w+']</code></p>

<h3><code>ignore_case</code></h3>

<p>Default: <code>True</code></p>

<p>Self-explanatory.</p>

<h3><code>replacements</code></h3>

<p>Default: <code>"$@%-?!"</code></p>

<p>A string with characters from which the replacements strings will be randomly generated.</p>

<p>Examples: <code>"%&amp;$?!"</code> or <code>"-"</code> etc.</p>

<h3><code>complete</code></h3>

<p>Default: <code>True</code></p>

<p>Controls if the entire string will be replaced or if the first and last chars will be kept.</p>

<h3><code>inside_words</code></h3>

<p>Default: <code>False</code></p>

<p>Controls if words are searched inside other words too. Disabling this </p>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Profanity? What the f***'s that? ;-)</p>

<p>It will still take a couple of years before a computer will really be able to recognize swearing and cursing and it is my sincere hope that people will have understood by then that profanity is human and not "dangerous."</p>

<p>Instead of a dumb filter, have a smart human moderator who can balance the tone of discussion as appropriate. A moderator who can detect abuse like:</p>

<p>"If you were my husband, I'd poison your tea." - "If you were my wife, I'd drink it."</p>

<p>(that was from Winston Churchill, btw.)</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Here's my Rather Lazy Attempt at this...My idea was to use the <code>difflib</code>. Ofcourse this isn't the entire program...but it should get you started :)</p>

<pre><code>import difflib,re
badwords = map(lambda x: x.strip(), open("words.txt","r").readlines())

body = open("text.txt","r").read();

p = re.compile("\w+")

for word in set(p.findall(body)):
    lst = difflib.get_close_matches(word,badwords,n=1,cutoff=0.9) #configure the cutoff accordin to how strict you want the filter
    if lst :
        body = body.replace(word,"!@#&amp;@%^tutsifruitsy$%&amp;$")

print body

<p>The <code>tutsifruitsy</code> is a reference to <code>"The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson"</code> :)</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>It's possible for users to work around this, of course, but it should do a fairly thorough job of removing profanity:</p>

<pre><code>import re
def remove_profanity(s):
    def repl(word):
        m = re.match(r"(\w+)(.*)", word)
        if not m:
            return word
        word = "Bork" if m.group(1)[0].isupper() else "bork"
        word += m.group(2)
        return word
    return " ".join([repl(w) for w in s.split(" ")])

print remove_profanity("You just come along with me and have a good time. The Galaxy's a fun place. You'll need to have this fish in your ear.")
