<h3>Question (ID-940149):</h3><h2>Distributing Ruby/Python desktop apps</h2><p>Is there any way besides Shoes to develop and distribute cross-platform GUI desktop applications written in Ruby?</p>

<p>I come to believe that general bugginess of _why's applications is exceptionally crippling in case of Shoes, and anything more complex than a two-button form is a pain to maintain.</p>

<p>RubyGTK, wxRuby, etc seem to be promising, but they do not solve the issue of distributing an app in a way that doesn't require Ruby pre-installed on users' computers — and libraries like ruby2exe seem to be horribly out-of-date and incomplete.</p>

<p>Generally — what is the current fad?</p>

<p>BTW: if there is a really easy solution to this in Python, I may consider redoing the stuff I'm up to in Python.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I don't know about ruby2exe, but py2exe works perfeclty fine. Even with librairies like wxWidgets. <strong>Edit</strong>: you don't even have to ask the user to install wxWidgets, it's bundled with the app (same goes for py2app)</p>

<p>I use it for my very small project <a href="http://github.com/loicwolff/notagapp/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>For the Mac crowd, py2app works fine too with wxWidgets.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>For Ruby, the <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/ocra/" rel="nofollow">One-Click Ruby Application Builder</a> (OCRA) is emerging as the successor to <a href="http://www.erikveen.dds.nl/rubyscript2exe/" rel="nofollow">RubyScript2Exe</a>. </p>

<p>Ocra works with both Ruby 1.8.6 and 1.9.1, and with wxRuby. Supports LZMA compression for relatively compact executables.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I don't know about Ruby, but the standard for Python is <a href="http://www.py2exe.org/" rel="nofollow">py2exe</a> to create Windows binaries. For me, the cross-plattform <a href="http://www.pyinstaller.org/" rel="nofollow">pyinstaller</a> has worked well, once. For your GUI, <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter" rel="nofollow">TkInter</a> is the standard. A lot of people like <a href="http://www.wxpython.org/" rel="nofollow">wxPython</a>. All those are fairly actively developed. I suggest playing a little bit around with these options to decide whether Python is the better choice.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The state of affairs is pretty bad.  The most reliable method at present is probably to use JRuby.  I know that's probably not the answer you want to hear, but, as you say, ruby2exe is unreliable, and Shoes is a long way off (and isn't even intended to be a full-scale application).  Personally, I dislike forcing users to install GTK or Qt or wxWidgets, but the JVM is fairly ubiquitous.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Depending on how far you development is, <a href="http://shoooes.net/" rel="nofollow">Shoes</a> is pretty good. Its basically it's own Ruby Distribution. It may be a bit hidden (in the files menu), but it allows you to package your application for all 3 platforms without having that Shoes startup screen.</p>

<p>The rendering engine behind it is Cairo.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I don't think anyone really answered his question.</p>

<p>As for me, I use VB to do Shell() calls to Ocra compiled Ruby scripts.
It works pretty well and allows me to create apps that run in all modern OS.</p>

<p>Linux testing is done by using Wine to run and ensuring that I use a pre .NET version of VB for the .exe compilation.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I've read about (but not used) Seattlerb's Wilson, which describes itself as a pure x86 assembler, but it doesn't sound like it'd be cross-platform or GUI.</p>
