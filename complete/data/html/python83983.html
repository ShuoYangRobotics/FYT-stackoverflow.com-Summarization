<h3>Question (ID-83983):</h3><h2>Why isn't the 'len' function inherited by dictionaries and lists in Python</h2><p>example:</p>

<pre><code>a_list = [1, 2, 3]
a_list.len() # doesn't work
len(a_list) # works
</code></pre>

<p>Python being (very) object oriented, I don't understand why the 'len' function isn't inherited by the object. 
Plus I keep trying the wrong solution since it appears as the logical one to me</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First of all, I chose len(x) over x.len() for HCI reasons (def __len__() came much later). There are two intertwined reasons actually, both HCI:</p>
  
  <p>(a) For some operations, prefix notation just reads better than postfix — prefix (and infix!) operations have a long tradition in mathematics which likes notations where the visuals help the mathematician thinking about a problem. Compare the easy with which we rewrite a formula like x*(a+b) into x*a + x*b to the clumsiness of doing the same thing using a raw OO notation.</p>
  
  <p>(b) When I read code that says len(x) I know that it is asking for the length of something. This tells me two things: the result is an integer, and the argument is some kind of container. To the contrary, when I read x.len(), I have to already know that x is some kind of container implementing an interface or inheriting from a class that has a standard len(). Witness the confusion we occasionally have when a class that is not implementing a mapping has a get() or keys() method, or something that isn’t a file has a write() method.</p>
  
  <p>Saying the same thing in another way, I see ‘len‘ as a built-in operation. I’d hate to lose that. /…/</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The short answer: 1) backwards compatibility and 2) there's not enough of a difference for it to really matter.  For a more detailed explanation, read on.</p>

<p>The idiomatic Python approach to such operations is special methods which aren't intended to be called directly.  For example, to make <code>x + y</code> work for your own class, you write a <code>__add__</code> method.  To make sure that <code>int(spam)</code> properly converts your custom class, write a <code>__int__</code> method.  To make sure that <code>len(foo)</code> does something sensible, write a <code>__len__</code> method.</p>

<p>This is how things have always been with Python, and I think it makes a lot of sense for some things.  In particular, this seems like a sensible way to implement operator overloading.  As for the rest, different languages disagree; in Ruby you'd convert something to an integer by calling <code>spam.to_i</code> directly instead of saying <code>int(spam)</code>.</p>

<p>You're right that Python is an extremely object-oriented language and that having to call an external function on an object to get its length seems odd.  On the other hand, <code>len(silly_walks)</code> isn't any more onerous than <code>silly_walks.len()</code>, and Guido has said that he actually prefers it (<a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-3000/2006-November/004643.html" rel="nofollow">http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-3000/2006-November/004643.html</a>).</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>It just isn't.</p>

<p>You can, however, do:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; [1,2,3].__len__()

3
</code></pre>

<p>Adding a <code>__len__()</code> method to a class is what makes the <code>len()</code> magic work.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>This way fits in better with the rest of the language. The convention in python is that you add <code>__foo__</code> special methods to objects to make them have certain capabilities (rather than e.g. deriving from a specific base class). For example, an object is </p>

<ul>
<li>callable if it has a <code>__call__</code> method  </li>
<li>iterable if it has an <code>__iter__</code> method, </li>
<li>supports access with [] if it has <code>__getitem__</code> and <code>__setitem__</code>. </li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>One of these special methods is <code>__len__</code> which makes it have a length accessible with <code>len()</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Maybe you're looking for <code>__len__</code>.  If that method exists, then len(a) calls it:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class Spam:
...   def __len__(self): return 3
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; s = Spam()
&gt;&gt;&gt; len(s)
3
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Well, there actually is a length method, it is just hidden:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a_list = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a_list.__len__()
3
</code></pre>

<p>The len() built-in function appears to be simply a wrapper for a call to the hidden <strong>len</strong>() method of the object.</p>

<p>Not sure why they made the decision to implement things this way though.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>there is some good info below on why certain things are functions and other are methods.  It does indeed cause some inconsistencies in the language.</p>
