<h3>Question (ID-8236380):</h3><h2>Why is semicolon allowed in this python snippet?</h2><p>Python does not warrant the use of semicolons to end statements.
So why is this (below) allowed?</p>

<pre><code>import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-9):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Python does not <em>require</em> semi-colons to terminate statements.  Semi colons <em>can</em> be used to delimit statements if you wish to put multiple statements on the same line.</p>

<p>Now, <em>why</em> is this allowed?  It's a simple design decision.  I don't think Python needs this semi-colon thing, but somebody thought it would be nice to have and added it to the language.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Compound statements consist of one or more ‘clauses.’ A clause
  consists of a header and a ‘suite.’ The clause headers of a particular
  compound statement are all at the same indentation level. Each clause
  header begins with a uniquely identifying keyword and ends with a
  colon. A suite is a group of statements controlled by a clause. <strong>A
  suite can be one or more semicolon-separated simple statements on the
  same line as the header, following the header’s colon, or it can be
  one or more indented statements on subsequent lines</strong>. Only the latter
  form of suite can contain nested compound statements; the following is
  illegal, mostly because it wouldn’t be clear to which if clause a
  following else clause would belong:</p>

<pre><code>if test1: if test2: print x
</code></pre>
  
  <p>Also note that the semicolon binds tighter than the colon in this
  context, so that in the following example, either all or none of the
  print statements are executed:</p>

<pre><code>if x &lt; y &lt; z: print x; print y; print z 
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Summarizing:</p>

<pre><code>compound_stmt ::=  if_stmt
                   | while_stmt
                   | for_stmt
                   | try_stmt
                   | with_stmt
                   | funcdef
                   | classdef
                   | decorated
suite         ::=  stmt_list NEWLINE | NEWLINE INDENT statement+ DEDENT
statement     ::=  stmt_list NEWLINE | compound_stmt
stmt_list     ::=  simple_stmt (";" simple_stmt)* [";"]

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>A quote from "<a href="http://onjava.com/pub/a/python/2004/02/05/learn_python.html" rel="nofollow">When Pythons Attack</a>"</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don't terminate all of your statements with a semicolon. It's technically legal to do this in Python, but is totally useless unless you're placing more than one statement on a single line (e.g., x=1; y=2; z=3).</p>
</blockquote>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>As everyone else has noted, you <em>can</em> use semicolons to separate statements. You don't <em>have</em> to, and it's not the usual style.</p>

<p>As for why this is useful, some people like to put two or more really trivial short statements on a single line (personally I think this turns several trivial easily skimmed lines into one complex-looking line and makes it harder to see that it's trivial).</p>

<p>But it's almost a requirement when you're invoking Python one liners from the shell using <code>python -c '&lt;some python code&gt;'</code>. Here you <em>can't</em> use indentation to separate statements, so if your one-liner is really a two-liner, you'll need to use a semicolon. And if you want to use other arguments in your one-liner, you'll have to import <code>sys</code> to get at <code>sys.argv</code>, which requires a separate <code>import</code> statement. e.g.</p>

<pre><code>python -c "import sys; print ' '.join(sorted(sys.argv[1:]))" 5 2 3 1 4
1 2 3 4 5
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Multiple statements on one line may include semicolons as separators. For example: <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/compound_stmts.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/reference/compound_stmts.html</a> In your case, it makes for an easy insertion of a point to break into the debugger.</p>

<p>Also, as mentioned by Mark Lutz in the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=1HxWGezDZcgC&amp;pg=PA390&amp;lpg=PA390&amp;dq=semicolons+technically+legal+python&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LjGfWKb6lW&amp;sig=PzxNVu0ZoEQA-KxUZ1W5OB9qTJw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=dVLMTun4FoTC2wWkm-ipDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=semicolons%20technically%20legal%20python&amp;f=false" rel="nofollow">Learning Python Book</a>, it is technically legal (although unnecessary and annoying) to terminate <em>all</em> your statements with semicolons. </p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Python uses the <code>;</code> as a separator, not a terminator.  You can also use them at the end of a line, which makes them <em>look</em> like a statement terminator, but this is legal only because blank statements are legal in Python -- a line that contains a semicolon at the end is two statements, the second one blank.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>semicolons are part of valid syntax: <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/compound_stmts.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/reference/compound_stmts.html</a></p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Python does let you use a semi-colon to denote the end of a statement if you are including more than one statement on a line.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>Semicolons can be used to one line two or more commands. They don't have to be used, but they aren't restricted.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The semicolon ( ; ) allows multiple statements on the single line given that neither statement starts a new code block.</p>
