<h3>Question (ID-524548):</h3><h2>Regular expression to detect semi-colon terminated C++ for & while loops</h2><p>In my Python application, I need to write a regular expression that matches a C++ <code>for</code> or <code>while</code> loop that has been terminated with a semi-colon (<code>;</code>). For example, it should match this:</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++);
</code></pre>

<p>... but not this:</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
</code></pre>

<p>This looks trivial at first glance, until you realise that the text between the opening and closing parenthesis may contain other parenthesis, for example:</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = funcA(); i &lt; funcB(); i++);
</code></pre>

<p>I'm using the python.re module. Right now my regular expression looks like this (I've left my comments in so you can understand it easier):</p>

<pre><code># match any line that begins with a "for" or "while" statement:
^\s*(for|while)\s*
\(  # match the initial opening parenthesis
    # Now make a named group 'balanced' which matches a balanced substring.
    (?P&lt;balanced&gt;
        # A balanced substring is either something that is not a parenthesis:
        [^()]
        | # …or a parenthesised string:
        \( # A parenthesised string begins with an opening parenthesis
            (?P=balanced)* # …followed by a sequence of balanced substrings
        \) # …and ends with a closing parenthesis
    )*  # Look for a sequence of balanced substrings
\)  # Finally, the outer closing parenthesis.
# must end with a semi-colon to match:
\s*;\s*
</code></pre>

<p>This works perfectly for all the above cases, but it breaks as soon as you try and make the third part of the for loop contain a function, like so:</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; doSomethingTo(i));
</code></pre>

<p>I think it breaks because as soon as you put some text between the opening and closing parenthesis, the "balanced" group matches that contained text, and thus the <code>(?P=balanced)</code> part doesn't work any more since it won't match (due to the fact that the text inside the parenthesis is different).</p>

<p>In my Python code I'm using the VERBOSE and MULTILINE flags, and creating the regular expression like so:</p>

<pre><code>REGEX_STR = r"""# match any line that begins with a "for" or "while" statement:
^\s*(for|while)\s*
\(  # match the initial opening parenthesis
    # Now make a named group 'balanced' which matches
    # a balanced substring.
    (?P&lt;balanced&gt;
        # A balanced substring is either something that is not a parenthesis:
        [^()]
        | # …or a parenthesised string:
        \( # A parenthesised string begins with an opening parenthesis
            (?P=balanced)* # …followed by a sequence of balanced substrings
        \) # …and ends with a closing parenthesis
    )*  # Look for a sequence of balanced substrings
\)  # Finally, the outer closing parenthesis.
# must end with a semi-colon to match:
\s*;\s*"""

REGEX_OBJ = re.compile(REGEX_STR, re.MULTILINE| re.VERBOSE)
</code></pre>

<p>Can anyone suggest an improvement to this regular expression? It's getting too complicated for me to get my head around.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You could write a little, very simple routine that does it, without using a regular expression:</p>

<ul>
<li>Set a position counter <code>pos</code> so that is points to just before the opening bracket after your <code>for</code> or <code>while</code>. </li>
<li>Set an open brackets counter <code>openBr</code> to <code>0</code>.</li>
<li>Now keep incrementing <code>pos</code>, reading the characters at the respective positions, and increment <code>openBr</code> when you see an opening bracket, and decrement it when you see a closing bracket. That will increment it once at the beginning, for the first opening bracket in "<code>for (</code>", increment and decrement some more for some brackets in between, and set it back to <code>0</code> when your <code>for</code> bracket closes. </li>
<li>So, stop when <code>openBr</code> is <code>0</code> again.</li>
</ul>

<p>The stopping positon is your closing bracket of <code>for(...)</code>. Now you can check if there is a semicolon following or not.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>This is the kind of thing you really shouldn't do with a regular expression. Just parse the string one character at a time, keeping track of opening/closing parentheses.</p>

<p>If this is all you're looking for, you definitely don't need a full-blown C++ grammar lexer/parser. If you want practice, you can write a little recursive-decent parser, but even that's a bit much for just matching parentheses.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>This is a great example of using the wrong tool for the job. Regular expressions do not handle arbitrarily nested sub-matches very well. What you should do instead is use a real lexer and parser (a grammar for C++ should be easy to find) and look for unexpectedly empty loop bodies.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I wouldn't even pay attention to the contents of the parens.</p>

<p>Just match any line that starts with <code>for</code> and ends with semi-colon:</p>

<pre><code>^\t*for.+;$
</code></pre>

<p>Unless you've got <code>for</code> statements split over multiple lines, that will work fine?</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Greg is absolutely correct.  This kind of parsing cannot be done with regular expressions.   I suppose it is possible to build some horrendous monstrosity that would work for many cases, but then you'll just run across something that does.</p>

<p>You really need to use more traditional parsing techniques.   For example, its pretty simple to write a recursive decent parser to do what you need. </p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I don't know that regex would handle something like that very well. Try something like this</p>

<pre><code>line = line.Trim();
if(line.StartsWith("for") &amp;&amp; line.EndsWith(";")){
    //your code here
}
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Another thought that ignores parentheses and treats the <code>for</code> as a construct holding three semicolon-delimited values:</p>

<pre><code>for\s*\([^;]+;[^;]+;[^;]+\)\s*;
</code></pre>

<p>This option works even when split over multiple lines (once MULTILINE enabled), but assumes that <code>for ( ... ; ... ; ... )</code> is the only valid construct, so wouldn't work with a <code>for ( x in y )</code> construct, or other deviations.</p>

<p>Also assumes that there are no functions containing semi-colons as arguments, such as:</p>

<pre><code>for ( var i = 0; i &lt; ListLen('a;b;c',';') ; i++ );
</code></pre>

<p>Whether this is a likely case depends on what you're actually doing this for.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Try this regexp</p>

<pre><code>^\s*(for|while)\s*
\(
(?P&lt;balanced&gt;
[^()]*
|
(?P=balanced)
\)
\s*;\s
</code></pre>

<p>I removed the wrapping <code>\( \)</code> around <code>(?P=balanced)</code> and moved the <code>*</code> to behind the any not paren sequence.  I have had this work with boost xpressive, and rechecked that website (<a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_37_0/doc/html/xpressive/user_s_guide.html#boost_xpressive.user_s_guide.grammars_and_nested_matches" rel="nofollow">Xpressive</a>) to refresh my memory.</p>
