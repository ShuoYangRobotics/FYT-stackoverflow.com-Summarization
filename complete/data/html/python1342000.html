<h3>Question (ID-1342000):</h3><h2>How to replace non ascii characters in string?</h2><p>I have a string that looks like so:</p>

<pre><code>6Â 918Â 417Â 712
</code></pre>

<p>The clear cut way to trim this string (as I understand Python) is simply to</p>

<p>say the string is in a variable called s, we get:</p>

<pre><code>s.replace('Â ', '')
</code></pre>

<p>That should do the trick. But of course it complains that the Non-ASCII character <code>'\xc2'</code> in file <code>blabla.py</code> is not encoded.</p>

<p>I never quite could understand how to switch between different encodings.</p>

<p>Appreciate some help.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Here's the code, it really is just the same as above, but now it's in context.</p>

<p>The file is saved as UTF-8 in notepad.
The file has the following header:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python2.4
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
</code></pre>

<p>The code:</p>

<pre><code>f = urllib.urlopen(url)

soup = BeautifulSoup(f)

s = soup.find('div', {'id':'main_count'})

#making a print 's' here goes well. it shows 6Â 918Â 417Â 712

s.replace('Â ','')

save_main_count(s)
</code></pre>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>it gets no further than s.replace...</p>

</code></pre>

<p>edit: my first impulse is always to use a filter, but the generator expression is more memory efficient (and shorter)...</p>

<pre><code>def removeNonAscii(s): return "".join(i for i in s if ord(i)&lt;128)
</code></pre>

<p>Keep in mind that this is guaranteed to work with UTF-8 encoding (because all bytes in multi-byte characters have the highest bit set to 1).</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><ul>
<li>You need a declaration at the top of each source file that uses Unicode literals.</li>
</ul>

<p>See:
<a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/interpreter.html#source-code-encoding" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/tutorial/interpreter.html#source-code-encoding</a></p>

<p>Assuming utf8, this would go at the top:</p>

<pre><code># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>The source file must be saved using the correct encoding in your text editor as well.</p></li>
<li><p>The literal must have a <code>u</code> before it, as in <code>s.replace(u"Â ", "")</code></p></li>
<li><p>The string <code>s</code> must be a unicode string as well. BeautifulSoup might not be returning unicode here. Try <code>s = s.decode('utf-8')</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>string.replace</code> returns a new string and does not edit in place, so make sure you're using the return value as well</p></li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; unicode_string = u"hello aåbäcö"
&gt;&gt;&gt; unicode_string.encode("ascii", "ignore")
'hello abc'
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

s = u"6Â 918Â 417Â 712"
s = s.replace(u"Â", "") 
print s
</code></pre>

<p>This will print out <code>6 918 417 712</code></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Using Regex:</p>

<pre><code>import re

strip_unicode = re.compile("([^-_a-zA-Z0-9!@#%&amp;=,/'\";:~`\$\^\*\(\)\+\[\]\.\{\}\|\?\&lt;\&gt;\\]+|[^\s]+)")
print strip_unicode.sub('', u'6Â 918Â 417Â 712')
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><pre><code>s.replace(u'Â ', '')              # u before string is important
</code></pre>

<p>and make your <code>.py</code> file unicode.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>This is a dirty hack, but may work.</p>

<pre><code>s2 = ""
for i in s:
    if ord(i) &lt; 128:
        s2 += i
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>I know it's an old thread, but I felt compelled to mention the translate method, which is always a good way to replace all character codes above 128 (or other if necessary).</p>

<p><em>Usage</em> : str.<strong>translate</strong>(<em>table[, deletechars]</em>)</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; trans_table = ''.join( [chr(i) for i in range(128)] + [' '] * 128 )

&gt;&gt;&gt; 'Résultat'.translate(trans_table)
'R sultat'
&gt;&gt;&gt; '6Â 918Â 417Â 712'.translate(trans_table)
'6  918  417  712'
</code></pre>

<p>Starting with <em>Python 2.6</em>, you can also set the table to None, and use <em>deletechars</em> to delete the characters you don't want as in the examples shown in the standard docs at <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html</a>.</p>

<p>With unicode strings, the translation table is not a 256-character string but a dict with the ord() of relevant characters as keys. But anyway getting a proper ascii string from a unicode string is simple enough, using the method mentioned by truppo above, namely : unicode_string.encode("ascii", "ignore")</p>

<p>As a summary, if for some reason you absolutely need to get an ascii string (for instance, when you raise a standard exception with <code>raise Exception, ascii_message</code> ), you can use the following function:</p>

<pre><code>trans_table = ''.join( [chr(i) for i in range(128)] + ['?'] * 128 )
def ascii(s):
    if isinstance(s, unicode):
        return s.encode('ascii', 'replace')
    else:
        return s.translate(trans_table)
</code></pre>

<p>The good thing with translate is that you can actually convert accented characters to <em>relevant</em> non-accented ascii characters instead of simply deleting them or replacing them by '?'. This is often useful, for instance for indexing purposes.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>For what it was worth, my character set was utf-8 and I had included the classic "# -<em>- coding: utf-8 -</em>-" line.</p>

<p>However, I discovered that I didn't have Universal Newlines when reading this data from a webpage. My text had two words, separated by "\r\n". I was only splitting on the \n and replacing the "\n". Once I looped through and saw the character set in question, I realized the mistake.</p>

<p>So, it could also be within the ASCII character set, but a character that you didn't expect.</p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>Way too late for an answer, but the original string was in UTF-8 and '\xc2\xa0' is UTF-8 for NO-BREAK SPACE.  Simply decode the original string as <code>s.decode('utf-8')</code> (\xa0 displays as a space when decoded incorrectly as Windows-1252 or latin-1:</p>

<h3>Example (Python 3)</h3>

<pre><code>s = b'6\xc2\xa0918\xc2\xa0417\xc2\xa0712'
print(s.decode('latin-1')) # incorrectly decoded
u = s.decode('utf8') # correctly decoded
print(u)
print(u.replace('\N{NO-BREAK SPACE}','_'))
print(u.replace('\xa0','-')) # \xa0 is Unicode for NO-BREAK SPACE
</code></pre>

<h3>Output</h3>

<pre><code>6Â 918Â 417Â 712
6 918 417 712
6_918_417_712
6-918-417-712
