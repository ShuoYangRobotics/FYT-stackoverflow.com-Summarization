<h3>Question (ID-2480808):</h3><h2>Search backward through a string using a regex (in Python)?</h2><p><strong>Context</strong><br>
I'm parsing some code and want to match the doxygen comments before a function. However, because I want to match for a specific function name, getting only the immediately previous comment is giving me problems.</p>

<p><strong>Current Approach</strong>  </p>

<pre><code>import re  
function_re = re.compile(
    r"\/\*\*(.+)\*\/\s*void\s+(\w+)\s*::\s*function_name\s*\(\s*\)\s*")  
function_match = function_re.search(file_string)
if function_match:  
    function_doc_str = update_match.group(2)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Problem with Current Approach</strong><br>
The current approach matches doxygen from earlier functions, giving me a result that is the wrong doxygen comment.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong><br>
Is there a way to search backward through a string using the Python Regex library?<br>
It seems like my problem is that the more restrictive (less frequently occurring part) is the function signature, "void function()"    </p>

<p><strong>Possible better question</strong><br>
Is there a better (easier) approach that I'm missing?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>simplest way is to just use a group, you don't need to go backwards...</p>

<pre><code> (commentRegex)functionRegex
</code></pre>

<p>Then just extract group 1. You will need to run in multi-line mode to get it working, i don't know python so i can't be more helpful.</p>

<p>It's also possible with lookahead assertions, but this way is simpler.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I think you should use a regex that only matches doxymentation that's immediately before the function. Maybe something like this (simplified example):</p>

<pre><code>import re

test = """

/**
    @doxygen comment
*/
void function()
{
}

"""

doxygenRegex = r"(?P&lt;comment&gt;/\*\*(?:[^/]|/(?!\*\*))*\*/)"
functionRegex = r"(?P&lt;function&gt;\s\w+\s+(?P&lt;functionName&gt;\w+)\s*\()"

match = re.search(doxygenRegex + functionRegex, test)
print match.groupdict()
</code></pre>

<p>As long as this matches something, you can loop the regex matching - but starting the search at <code>test[match.end():]</code> next time. Hope that makes sense to you...</p>

<p>BTW if you only want to extract the comment and nothing about the function, you can use lookahead - just replace <code>functionRegex</code> with <code>r"(?=\s\w+\s+\w+\s*\()"</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>This can be achived using a single reg-ex.</p>

<p>The key is to capture the comment just before the desired function.
The easy way to do this is to use non-greedy qualifier.
For example: <code>/\*\*(.*?)\*/</code> with MULTILINE flag;
however, in Python, non-greedy and MULTILINE do not work together (at least on my environment).
So, you need a little trick like this:</p>

<p><code>/\*\*((?:[^\*]|\*(?!/))*)\*/</code>.</p>

<p>This is to match:</p>

<p>1: the comment begin <code>/**</code>.</p>

<p>2: everything that is not <code>*</code> OR <code>*</code> that does not follows by <code>/</code></p>

<p>3: the comment end <code>*/</code>.</p>

<p>From this idea the code you want is:</p>

<pre><code>function_name  = "function2"
regex_comment  = "/\*\*((?:[^\*]|\*(?!/))*)\*/"
regex_static   = "(?:(\w+)\s*::\s*)?"
regex_function = "(\w+)\s+"+regex_static+"(?:"+function_name+")\s*\([^\)]*\)"
regex = re.compile(regex_comment+"\s*"+regex_function, re.MULTILINE)
text  = """
/**
    @doxygen comment1
*/
void test::function1()
{
}

/**
    @doxygen comment2
*/
void test::function2()
{
}
"""
match = regex.search(text)
if (match == None): print "None"
else:               print match.group(1)
</code></pre>

<p>When run, you got:</p>

<pre><code>
    @doxygen comment2

</code></pre>

<p>Variation:
If you want to capture <code>/**</code> and <code>*/</code> too, use <code>regex_comment  = "(/\*\*(?:[^\*]|\*(?!/))*\*/)"</code>.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Note that C isn't a regular language, so it cannot be parsed by regular expressions. Have you considered leveraging doxygen itself to parse this file?</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You can do look-behind assertions with <code>(?&lt;=...)</code> or <code>(?&lt;!...)</code>, but in general you can only match forwards.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>The question is why are these comments not inside the function, so you can use <strong>doc</strong>.</p>

<p>But there is no easy way with regex.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>here's a non regex approach, split on <code>*/</code> and find if the function you are looking for is at the next item. eg</p>

<pre><code>test = """

/**
    @doxygen comment
*/
void function()
{
}

"""

t=test.split("*/")
for n,comm in enumerate(t):
    try:
        if "void" in t[n+1]:
             print t[n]
    except IndexError: pass
</code></pre>
