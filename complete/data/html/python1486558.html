<h3>Question (ID-1486558):</h3><h2>Evaluating into two or more lists</h2><p>Howdy, codeboys and codegirls!</p>

<p>I have came across a simple problem with seemingly easy solution. But being a Python neophyte I feel that there is a better approach somewhere.</p>

<p>Say you have a list of mixed strings. There are two basic types of strings in the sack - ones with "=" in them (a=potato) and ones without (Lady Jane). What you need is to sort them into two lists.</p>

<p>The obvious approach is to:</p>

<pre><code>for arg in arguments:
   if '=' in arg:
       equal.append(arg)
   else:
       plain.append(arg)
</code></pre>

<p>Is there any other, more elegant way into it? Something like:</p>

<pre><code>equal = [arg for arg in arguments if '=' in arg]
</code></pre>

<p>but to sort into multiple lists?</p>

<p>And what if you have more than one type of data?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-9):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Try</p>

<pre><code>for arg in arguments:
    lst = equal if '=' in arg else plain
    lst.append(arg)
</code></pre>

<p>or (holy ugly)</p>

<pre><code>for arg in arguments:
    (equal if '=' in arg else plain).append(arg)
</code></pre>

<p>A third option: Create a class which offers <code>append()</code> and which sorts into several lists.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You can use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/itertools.html#itertools.groupby" rel="nofollow"><code>itertools.groupby()</code></a> for this:</p>

<pre><code>import itertools
f = lambda x: '=' in x
groups = itertools.groupby(sorted(data, key=f), key=f)
for k, g in groups:
    print k, list(g)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I would just go for two list comprehensions. While that does incur some overhead (two loops on the list), it is more Pythonic to use a list comprehension than to use a for. It's also (in my mind) much more readable than using all sorts of really cool tricks, but that less people know about.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><pre><code>def which_list(s):
    if "=" in s: 
        return 1
    return 0

lists = [[], []]

for arg in arguments:
    lists[which_list(arg)].append(arg)

plain, equal = lists
</code></pre>

<p>If you have more types of data, add an if clause to <code>which_list</code>, and initialize <code>lists</code> to more empty lists.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I would go for Edan's approach, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>equal = [arg for arg in arguments if '=' in arg]
plain = [arg for arg in arguments if '=' not in arg]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I read somewhere here that you might be interested in a solution that
will work for <em>more</em> than two identifiers (equals sign and space). </p>

<p>The following solution just requires you update the <code>uniques</code> set with
anything you would like to match, the results are placed in a dictionary of lists
with the identifier as the key.   </p>

<pre><code>uniques = set('= ')
matches = dict((key, []) for key in uniques)

for arg in args:
    key = set(arg) &amp; uniques
    try:
        matches[key.pop()].append(arg)
    except KeyError:
        # code to handle where arg does not contain = or ' '.
</code></pre>

<p>Now the above code assumes that you will only have a single match for your identifier
in your <code>arg</code>. I.e that you don't have an <code>arg</code> that looks like this <code>'John= equalspace'</code>.
You will have to also think about how you would like to treat cases that don't match anything in the set (<code>KeyError</code> occurs.)</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Another approach is to use the <code>filter</code> function, although it's not the most efficient solution.<br />
Example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; l = ['a=s','aa','bb','=', 'a+b']
&gt;&gt;&gt; l2 = filter(lambda s: '=' in s, l)
&gt;&gt;&gt; l3 = filter(lambda s: '+' in s, l)
&gt;&gt;&gt; l2
['a=s', '=']
&gt;&gt;&gt; l3
['a+b']
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>I put this together, and then see that Ned Batchelder was already on this same tack.  I chose to package the splitting method instead of the list chooser, though, and to just use the implicit 0/1 values for False and True.</p>

<pre><code>def split_on_condition(source, condition):
    ret = [],[]
    for s in source:
        ret[condition(s)].append(s)
    return ret

src = "z=1;q=2;lady jane;y=a;lucy in the sky".split(';')

plain,equal = split_on_condition(src, lambda s:'=' in s)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>Your approach is the best one. For sorting just into two lists it can't get clearer than that. If you want it to be a one-liner, encapsulate it in a function:</p>

<pre><code>def classify(arguments):
    equal, plain = [], []
    for arg in arguments:
        if '=' in arg:
            equal.append(arg)
        else:
            plain.append(arg)
    return equal, plain


equal, plain = classify(lst)
</code></pre>
