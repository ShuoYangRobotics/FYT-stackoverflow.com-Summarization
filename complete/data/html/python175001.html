<h3>Question (ID-175001):</h3><h2>Is there a definitive book on Python?</h2><p>There have been several questions here on SO about resources for learning Python (which have been most helpful,) but I was wondering if there was some consensus in the Python community about what the definitive reference book was once you knew the language?</p>

<p>I'm hoping for something along the same lines as K&amp;R's "The C Programming Language," or Larry Wall's "Programming Perl."  Any suggestions would be most appreciated.</p>

<p>(Edit: again, I'm not looking for a tutorial or an introduction, I was hoping for a solid reference that I could get at when I didn't have access to the web.)</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I have to say I like the documentation that comes with the language. This seems to be the definitive reference that's constantly smacked into new people in the #python chatroom on freenode.</p>

<p>Edit: You can download the python documentation to your computer. If you are using Windows the CHM version is excellent.</p>

<p>Though I am also fond of <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0672328623" rel="nofollow">Python Essential Reference</a>.</p>

<li>My favorite is <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0596100469" rel="nofollow">Python in a nutshell</a>. I always have a copy on my desk, as well as on my Safari account.</li>
<li>I also keep the <a href="http://docs.python.org/download.html" rel="nofollow">official documentation</a> on my laptop. </li>
<li>A pydoc HTTP server (<code>pydoc -p portnumber</code>) is always running in the background.</li>

It gives a thorough discussion of the core language, including some very lucid discussion of the wonkier aspects of the language (such as generators, list comprehensions). I found the coverage of the built in data structures very handy. This book is a good reference.  </p>

A good tutorial that walks through a lot of the libraries and gives plenty of motivating examples. I think this is a great book to start on the language.</p>

<p><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0672328623" rel="nofollow"><strong>Python Essential Reference</strong></a><br>
Good reference on the standard library. Getting a little dated though.  </p>

<p>UPDATE: <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0672329786" rel="nofollow">Python Essential Reference, 4th edition</a> is now out. It updates for both 2.6 and 3.0. Very well done.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0596009259" rel="nofollow">Programming Python</a> and probably <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0672328623" rel="nofollow">Python Essential Reference</a> - and of course <a href="http://docs.python.org" rel="nofollow">docs.python.org</a> can be considered the most complete/useful/up-to-date reference (for offline use see the <a href="http://docs.python.org/download.html" rel="nofollow">Download</a> section).</p>

<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Dive into Python is good, but the original is getting dated. </p>

<p>Luckily, there is an updated version, atleast online, I'm not certain if it's also available on dead trees yet: <a href="http://diveintopython3.org/" rel="nofollow">http://diveintopython3.org/</a></p>
