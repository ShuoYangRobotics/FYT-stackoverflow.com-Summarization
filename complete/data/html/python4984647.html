<h3>Question (ID-4984647):</h3><h2>Accessing dict keys like an attribute in Python?</h2><p>I find it more conveniant to access dict keys as <code>obj.foo</code> instead of <code>obj['foo']</code>, so I wrote this snippet:</p>

<pre><code>class AttributeDict(dict):
    def __getattr__(self, attr):
        return self[attr]
    def __setattr__(self, attr, value):
        self[attr] = value
</code></pre>

<p>However, I assume there must be some reason that Python doesn't provide this functionality out of the box. What would be the caveats and pitfalls of accessing dict keys in this manner?</p>

<pre><code>class AttributeDict(dict): 
    __getattr__ = dict.__getitem__
    __setattr__ = dict.__setitem__
</code></pre>

<p>Much more concise and doesn't leave any room for extra cruft getting into your <code>__getattr__</code> and <code>__setattr__</code> functions in the future. </p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>It doesn't work in generality.  Not all valid dict keys make addressable attributes ("the key").  So, you'll need to be careful.</p>

<p>Python objects are all basically dictionaries.  So I doubt there is much performance or other penalty.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>tuples can be used dict keys. How would you access tuple in your construct?</p>

<p>Also, <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple" rel="nofollow">namedtuple</a> is a convenient structure which can provide values via the attribute access.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You can have all legal string characters as part of the key if you use array notation.
For example, <code>obj['!#$%^&amp;*()_']</code></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>What if you wanted a key which was a method, such as <code>__eq__</code> or <code>__getattr__</code>?</p>

<p>And you wouldn't be able to have an entry that didn't start with a letter, so using <code>0343853</code> as a key is out.</p>

<p>And what if you didn't want to use a string?</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>No need to write your own as
<a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#setattr" rel="nofollow">setattr()</a> and getattr() already exist.</p>

<p>The advantage of class objects probably comes into play in class definition and inheritance.</p>
