<h3>Question (ID-712124):</h3><h2>Going nuts with executing python script via crontab on debian!</h2><p>This is what my crontab file looks like:</p>

<pre><code>* * * * *  root /usr/bin/python /root/test.py &gt;&gt; /root/classwatch.log 2&gt;&amp;1
</code></pre>

<p>This is what my python script looks like:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python
print "hello"
</code></pre>

<p>The cronjob creates the log file. But it is empty. I am also pretty certain that the python file is not being executed.</p>

<p>Appreciate any help! I've been playing with it for past 4 hrs with no luck.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>There are two ways to create a crontab -- per user or globally. For the global crontab (/etc/crontab) you specify the user, as per:</p>

<pre><code># m h dom mon dow user  command
17  *   *   *   *   root        cd / &amp;&amp; run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly
</code></pre>

<p>For user crontabs you don't, as per:</p>

<pre><code>aj@wherever:~$ crontab -l
0 * * * * /home/aj/bin/update-foobar
</code></pre>

<p>To get a python script running via #! notation, you just make the script executable (chmod 755 /root/test.py), and invoke it directly, something like:</p>

<pre><code>/root/test.py
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't want to do that, you can run it via the python interpretor by hand, like:</p>

<pre><code>/usr/bin/python /root/test.py
</code></pre>

<p>This assumes whichever user you're running as (ie the user in /etc/crontab, or the user you're running crontab -e as) has permission to see the python script -- /root might be inaccessible to regular users, eg.</p>

<p>You can get a good idea of whether your script is being executed at all by adding:</p>

<pre><code>import time
time.sleep(20)   # pause for 20 seconds
</code></pre>

<p>and then checking with "top" or "ps aux" or "pstree" to see if python's actually running.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Updated...</p>

<p>Replace the contents with</p>

<pre><code>* * * * * date &gt;&gt; /tmp/foo
</code></pre>

<p>Does this <a href="http://209.85.173.132/search?q=cache:JZMjUwxr%5F8AJ:ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php%3Ft%3D847446%2Bdebian%2Bcron%2Bmissing%2Boutput&amp;cd=8&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us" rel="nofollow">link</a> help?</p>

<p>Delete the file it is supposed to create.  Does it come back?
I thought each user had his own crontab file so the user on the line is suspsect.<br />
DId someone play a joke on you and replace the python binary with a no op?</p>

<p>I have to think cron isn't working right since the echo doesn't work.  Did you make sure to change the output directory to /tmp with the echo?</p>

<p>can you do an od (octal dump) of the file and see if maybe you put a control character or a tab into the cron file?</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><pre><code>chmod 755 /root/test.py
</code></pre>

<p>and then</p>

<pre><code>* * * * * /root/test.py &gt;&gt; /root/classwatch.log 2&gt;&amp;1
</code></pre>

<p>should work.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Have you tried putting the script someplace else (e.g. /usr/local/bin/)?</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>This works fine for me on my RHES 4 Linux box exactly as shown (NOTE: I removed the 'root' username in the crontab).</p>

<p>I suspect there's something wrong with the way you're installing your cron job, or the configuration of cron on your system. How are you installing this? Are you using <code>crontab -e</code> or some other method? Are you able to run any other cron jobs for root successfully?</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>It might be because of a job declared earlier failing due to syntax error. Can you paste your entire crontab? Your line looks good as far as I can see.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>The crontab entry is correct if you're editing /etc/crontab - however if you're
using your normal user's crontab (i.e. crontab -e, crontab crontabfle, etc) the
root entry is syntactically incorrect.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Try just sending stdout to the log file, instead of both stderr and stout:<br>
/usr/bin/python /root/test.py > /root/classwatch.log </p>
