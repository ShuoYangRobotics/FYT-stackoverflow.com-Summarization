<h3>Question (ID-1055443):</h3><h2>How do I find out what Python libraries are installed on my Mac?</h2><p>I'm just starting out with Python, and have found out that I can import various libraries. How do I find out what libraries exist on my Mac that I can import? How do I find out what functions they include?</p>

<p>I seem to remember using some web server type thing to browse through local help files, but I may have imagined that!</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>From the Python REPL (the command-line interpreter / Read-Eval-Print-Loop), type <code>help("modules")</code> to see a list of all your available libs.</p>

<p>Then to see functions within a module, do <code>help("posix")</code>, for example.  If you haven't <code>import</code>ed the library yet, you have to put quotes around the library's name.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Every standard python distribution has <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/index.html" rel="nofollow">these</a> libraries, which cover most of what you will need in a project.</p>

<p>In case you need to find out if a library exists at runtime, you do it like this</p>

<pre><code>try:
    import ObscureModule
except ImportError:
    print "you need to install ObscureModule"
    sys.exit(1) # or something like that
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>On Leopard, depending on the python package you're using and the version number, the modules can be found in /Library/Python:</p>

<p>/Library/Python/2.5/site-packages</p>

<p>or in /Library/Frameworks</p>

<p>/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/lib/python2.6/site-packages</p>

<p>(it could also be 3.0 or whatever version)...
I guess it is quite the same with Tiger</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You can install another library: yolk.</p>

<p>yolk is a python package manager and will show you everything you have added via pypi. But it will also show you site-packages added through whatever local package manager you run.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>For the web server, you can run the <code>pydoc</code> module that is included in the python distribution as a script:</p>

<pre><code>python /path/to/pydoc.py -p 1234
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>1234</code> is the port you want the server to run at. You can then visit <code>http://localhost:1234/</code> and browse the documentation. </p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>just run the Python interpeter and type the command
import "lib_name" 
if it gives an error, you don't have the lib installed...else you are good to go</p>
