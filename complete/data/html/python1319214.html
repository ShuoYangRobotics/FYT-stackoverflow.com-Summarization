<h3>Question (ID-1319214):</h3><h2>Shorter, more pythonic way of writing an if statements</h2><p>I have this</p>

<pre><code>bc = 'off'

if c.page == 'blog':
    bc = 'on'

print bc
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a more pythonic (and/or shorter) way of writing this in python?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Shortest one should be:</p>

<pre><code>bc = 'on' if c.page=='blog' else 'off'
</code></pre>

<p>Generally this might look a bit confusing, so you should only use it when it is clear what it means. Don't use it for big boolean clauses, since it begins to look ugly fast.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>This is:</p>

<ol>
<li>definitely shorter</li>
<li>arguably Pythonic (pre-Python 2.5, which introduced the controversial <code>X if Z else Y</code> syntax)</li>
<li><p>questionably readable.  With those caveats in mind, here it goes:</p>

<pre><code>bc = ("off","on")[c.page=="blog"]
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>EDIT: As per request, the generalized form is:</p>

<pre><code>   result = (on_false, on_true)[condition]
</code></pre>

<p>Explanation: <code>condition</code> can be anything that evaluates to a Boolean.  It is then treated as an integer since it is used to index the tuple: <code>False == 0</code>, <code>True == 1</code>, which then selects the right item from the tuple.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Well, not being a python guy please take this with a huge grain of salt, but having written (and, with more difficulty, <em>read</em>) a lot of clever code over the years, I find myself with a strong preference now for readable code.  I got the gist of what your original code was doing even though I'm a nobody as a Python guy.  To be sure, you could hide it and maybe impress a Python wonk or two, but why?</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Or you could use an inline if statement:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; cpage = 'blog'
&gt;&gt;&gt; bc = 'on' if cpage == 'blog' else 'off'
&gt;&gt;&gt; bc
'on'
&gt;&gt;&gt; cpage = 'asdf'
&gt;&gt;&gt; bc = 'on' if cpage == 'blog' else 'off'
&gt;&gt;&gt; bc
'off'
</code></pre>

<p>There's a bit of a writeup on that feature at <a href="http://www.siafoo.net/article/52#id34" rel="nofollow">this blog</a>, and the relevant PEP is <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.5/whatsnew/pep-308.html" rel="nofollow">PEP308</a>.  The inline if statement was introduced in Python 2.5.</p>

<p>This one might be a little less pythonic, but you can use and/or in this fashion:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; cpage = 'asdf'
&gt;&gt;&gt; bc = (cpage == 'blog') and 'on' or 'off'
&gt;&gt;&gt; bc
'off'
&gt;&gt;&gt; cpage = 'blog'
&gt;&gt;&gt; bc = (cpage == 'blog') and 'on' or 'off'
&gt;&gt;&gt; bc
'on'
</code></pre>

<p>This one is used more often in lambda statements than on a line by itself, but the form</p>

<pre><code> A and B or C
</code></pre>

<p>is similar to</p>

<pre><code>   if A:
       return B
   else:
       return C
</code></pre>

<p>I was going to write out a little bit longer explanation, but they covered it better <a href="http://www.diveintopython.org/power%5Fof%5Fintrospection/and%5For.html" rel="nofollow">at Dive into Python</a>.  They also noted a couple caveats that you probably need to know.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>you can use "a = b if c else d" but if you are using a python version prior to 2.5</p>

<pre><code>bc = c.page == "blog" and "on" or "off"
</code></pre>

<p>can do the trick also.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Another possibility is to use a dict if you can compute the values outside of the function that accesses them (i.e. the values are static, which also addresses the evaluation issue in scrible's answer's comments).</p>

<p>want_bc = {True: "on", False: "off"}</p>

<h1>...</h1>

<p>bc = want_bc[c.page == "blog"]</p>

<p>I prefer this and/or the tuple indexing solutions under the general rubric of preferring computation to testing.</p>
