<h3>Question (ID-843751):</h3><h2>list.append or list +=?</h2><p>Which is more pythonic?</p>

<pre><code>list.append(1)
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>list += [1]
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p><code>list.append(1)</code> is faster, because it doesn't create a temporary list object.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>From the <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/" rel="nofollow">Zen of Python</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Explicit is better than implicit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So: <code>list.append(1)</code></p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>These are two different operations, what you are doing with += is the extend operation. Here is what Python documents have to say about this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>list.append(x): Add an item to the end of the list; equivalent to a[len(a):] = [x].</p>
  
  <p>list.extend(L): Extend the list by appending all the items in the given list; equivalent to a[len(a):] = L.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So in += you provide a list, in append you just add a new element.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Since there's also</p>

<pre><code>list.extend(l)
</code></pre>

<p>which appends all elements of the given list, I would use</p>

<pre><code>list.append(1)
</code></pre>

<p>for symmetry and readability's sake.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>While most people here are preferring the append option, I personally prefer the other one because it looks nicer even though it may be slower (or maybe its optimized).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>When you write lots of Python code, I don't usually see something like this:</p>

<pre><code>list.append(1)
</code></pre>

<p>It's more like this:</p>

<pre><code>somecollectionname.append(anotherelementname+5*10)
</code></pre>

<p>So to me at least, it is nicer to see:</p>

<pre><code>somecollectionname += [anotherelementname+5*10]
</code></pre>

<p>Because its easy to recognize at a glance that you are adding to a list. Having said that, I sometimes find myself using both forms.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>list.append(1)
more readable and to consistent with the context</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>If you've got a single element, <code>a</code>, that you want to add to your list <code>l</code>, then putting <code>a</code> into its own list and extending <code>l</code> with it seems like adding unnecessary complexity. I would thus prefer </p>

<pre><code>l.append(a)
</code></pre>

<p>over</p>

<pre><code>l += [a]
</code></pre>

<p>If <code>a</code> is already a list, then choosing</p>

<pre><code>l += a
</code></pre>

<p>or </p>

<pre><code>l.extend(a)
</code></pre>

<p>is a matter of preference, IMO. On the other hand, if you're going to be doing a lot of extends, you can get a performance boost by "hoisting" the method lookup:</p>

<pre><code>extend = l.extend
for sublist in bunch_of_lists:
    extend(sublist)
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, I think that the append operation isn't used too often in Pythonic code, because append is used very often in "accumulator" idioms, where I'd expect a more experienced Python programmer to use a list comprehension/etc.</p>

<p>So instead of:</p>

<pre><code>l = []
for a in numbers:
    l.append(str(a))
</code></pre>

<p>You'd probably see:</p>

<pre><code>l = [str(a) for a in numbers]
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>l = map(str, numbers)
</code></pre>
