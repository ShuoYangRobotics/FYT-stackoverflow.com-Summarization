<h3>Question (ID-7181757):</h3><h2>How to implement division with round-towards-infinity in Python</h2><p>I want 3/2 to equal 2 not 1.5</p>

<p>I know there's a mathematical term for that operation(not called rounding up), but I can't recall it right now. 
Anyway, how do i do that without having to do two functions?</p>

<p>ex of what I do NOT want:</p>

<pre><code>answer = 3/2 then math.ceil(answer)=2 (why does math.ceil(3/2)=1?)  
</code></pre>

<p>ex of what I DO want:</p>

<pre><code> "function"(3/2) = 2
</code></pre>

<p>Python only offers native operators for two types of division: "true" division, and "round down" division. So what you want isn't available as a single function. However, it is possible to easily implement a number of different types of division-with-rounding using some short expressions. </p>

<p>Per the title's request: given strictly integer inputs, "round up" division can be implemented using <code>(a+(-a%b))//b</code>, and "round away from zero" division can be implemented using the more complex <code>a//b if a*b&lt;0 else (a+(-a%b))//b</code>. One of those is probably what you want. As to why...</p>

<hr>

<p><em>To give a longer answer...</em></p>

<p>First, let me answer the subquestion about why <code>3/2==1</code> and <code>math.ceil(3/2)==1.0</code>, by way of explaining how the Python division operator works. There are two main issues at play...</p>

<p><strong><code>float</code> vs <code>int</code> division:</strong> Under Python 2, division behaves differently depending on the type of the inputs. If both <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are integers, <code>a/b</code> performs "round down" or "floor integer" division (eg <code>3/2==1</code>, but <code>-3/2==-2</code>). This is equivalent to <code>int(math.floor(float(a)/b))</code> . </p>

<p>But if at least one of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are floats, Python performs "true" division, and gives you a <code>float</code> result (eg <code>3.0/2==1.5</code>, and <code>-3.0/2==-1.5</code>). This is why you'll sometimes see the construction <code>float(a)/b</code>: it's being used to force true division even both inputs are integers (eg <code>float(3)/2==1.5</code>). This is why your example <code>math.ceil(3/2)</code> returns <code>1.0</code>, whereas <code>math.ceil(float(3)/2)</code> returns <code>2.0</code>. The result has already been rounded down before it even reaches <code>math.ceil()</code>.</p>

<p><strong>"true division" by default</strong>: In 2001, it was decided (<a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0238/" rel="nofollow">PEP 238</a>) that Python's division operator should be changed so that it always performs "true" division, regardless of whether the inputs are floats or integers (eg, this would make <code>3/2==1.5</code>). In order to not break existing scripts, the change in default behavior was deferred until Python 3.0; in order to get this behavior under Python 2.x, you have to enable it per-file by adding <code>from __future__ import division</code> to the top of the file. Otherwise the old type-dependant behavior is used.</p>

<p>But "round down" division is still frequently needed, so the PEP didn't do way with it entirely. Instead, it introduced a new division operator: <code>a//b</code>, which <em>always</em> performs round down division, even if the inputs include floats. This can be used without doing anything special under both Python 2.2+ and 3.x. </p>

<hr>

<p><em>That out of that way, division-with-rounding:</em></p>

<p>In order to simplify things, the following expressions all use the <code>a//b</code> operator when working on integers, since it will behave the same under all python versions. As well, I'm making an assumption that <code>0&lt;=a%b&lt;b</code> if <code>b</code> is positive, and <code>b&lt;=a%b&lt;=0</code> if b is negative. This is how Python behaves, but other languages may have slightly different modulus operators. </p>

<p>The four basic types of integer division with rounding:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>"round down"</strong> aka "floor integer" aka "round to minus infinity" divsion: python offers this natively via <code>a//b</code>. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>"round up"</strong> aka "ceiling integer" aka "round to positive infinity" division: this can be achieved via <code>int(math.ceil(float(a)/b))</code> or <code>(a+(-a%b))//b</code>. The latter equation works because <code>-a%b</code> is 0 if <code>a</code> is a multiple of <code>b</code>, and is otherwise the amount we need to add to <code>a</code> to get to the next highest multiple.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>"round towards zero"</strong> aka "truncated" division - this can be achieved via <code>int(float(a)/b)</code>. Doing this without using floating point is trickier... since Python only offers round-down integer division, and the <code>%</code> operator has a similar round-down bias, we don't have any non-floating-point operators which round symmetrically about 0. So the only way I can think of is to construct a piecewise expression out of round-down and round-up: <code>a//b if a*b&gt;0 else (a+(-a%b))//b</code>. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>"round away from zero"</strong> aka "round to (either) infinity" division - unfortunately, this is even trickier than round-towards-zero. We can't leverage the truncating behavior of the <code>int</code> operator anymore, so I can't think of a simple expression even when including floating-point ops. So I have to go with the inverse of the round-to-zero expression, and use <code>a//b if a*b&lt;0 else (a+(-a%b))//b</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that if you're only using positive integers, <code>(a+b-1)//b</code> provides round up / away from zero even more efficiently than any of the above solutions, but falls apart for negatives.</p>

<p>Hope that helps... and happy to make edits if anyone can suggest better equations for round to/away from zero. I find the ones I have particularly unsatisfactory. </p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Integral division in Python 3:</p>

<p><code>3 // 2 == 1</code></p>

<p>Non-integral division in Python 3:</p>

<p><code>3 / 2 == 1.5</code></p>

<p>What you're talking about is not a division by all means.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>When you divide two integers, the result is an integer.<br>
<code>3 / 2</code> equals <code>1</code>, not <code>1.5</code>.<br>
See <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-long-complex" rel="nofollow">the documentation</a>, note 1:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For (plain or long) integer division, the result is an integer. The result is always rounded towards minus infinity: 1/2 is 0, (-1)/2 is -1, 1/(-2) is -1, and (-1)/(-2) is 0. Note that the result is a long integer if either operand is a long integer, regardless of the numeric value.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once you get <code>1</code> from the division, there is no way to turn that into <code>2</code>.</p>

<p>To get <code>1.5</code>, you need floating-point division: <code>3.0 / 2</code>.<br>
You can then call <code>math.ceil</code> to get <code>2</code>.</p>

<p>You are mistaken; there is no mathematical function that divides, then rounds up.<br>
The best you can do is write your own function that takes two floats and calls <code>math.ceil</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>What you probably want is something like:</p>

<pre><code>math.ceil(3.0/2.0)
# or
math.ceil(float(3)/float(2))
</code></pre>

<p>You could also do an import from future:</p>

<pre><code>from __future__ import division
math.ceil(3/2) # == 2
</code></pre>

<p>But, if you do this, to get the current behavior of integer division you need to use the double slash:</p>

<pre><code>3 // 2 == 1 # True
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>The intent of the OP's question is <strong>"How to implement division with round-towards-infinity in Python"</strong> (suggest you change the title).</p>

<p>This is a perfectly legitimate rounding mode as per the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754-2008#Rounding_algorithms" rel="nofollow">IEEE-754 standard</a> (read <a href="http://www.eetimes.com/design/programmable-logic/4014804/An-introduction-to-different-rounding-algorithms" rel="nofollow">this overview</a>), and the term for it is "round towards infinity" (or "round away from zero"). Most of the 9 downvotes were beating up on the OP unfairly. Yes, there is no single-function way to do this in native Python, but we can use <code>round(float(a)/b)</code> or else subclass <code>numbers.Number</code> and override <code>__div__()</code>.</p>

<p>The OP would need to clarify whether they want -3/2 to round to -2 or -1 (or don't-care for negative operands). Since they already said they don't want round-upwards, we can infer -3/2 should round to -2.</p>

<p>Enough theory. For implementations:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you just want the fast-and-dirty one-line solution for round-towards-infinity , use <code>round(float(a)/b)</code></li>
<li><p><code>math.ceil(float(a)/b)</code> gives you round-upwards, which you said you don't want</p></li>
<li><p>But if this is your default division operation, or you are doing a lot of this, then do like the pseudocode below: <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/numbers.html" rel="nofollow">inherit from one of the subclasses of <code>numbers.Number</code> Real, Rational or Integral (new in 2.6)</a>, redefine <code>__div__()</code> or else define a non-default alternative <code>__divra__()</code> operation. You could define a class member or classmethod <code>rounding_mode</code> and look it up during divisions. Be careful of <code>__rdiv__()</code> and mixing with ordinary floats though.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>.</p>

<pre><code>import numbers

class NumberWithRounding(numbers.Integral):
    # Here you could implement a classmethod setRoundingMode() or member rounding_mode
    def __div__(self,other):
        # here you could consider value of rounding_mode, or else hardwire it like:
        return round(float(self)/other)
    # You also have to raise ImplementationError/ pass/ or implement the other 31
    # methods for Float: __abs__(),...,__xor__() Just shortcut that for now...

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I think that what you're looking for is this:</p>

<p>assuming you have x (3) and y (2),</p>

<p><code>result = (x + y - 1) // y;</code></p>

<p>this is the equivalent of a ceiling without the use of floating points.</p>

<p>Of course, y cannot be 0.</p>

<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Firstly, you want to be using floating-point division in the arguments.  Use:</p>

<pre><code>from __future__ import division
</code></pre>

<p>If you always want to round up, so <code>f(3/2)==2</code> and <code>f(1.4)==2</code>, then you want <code>f</code> to be <code>math.trunc(math.ceil(x))</code>.</p>

<p>If you want to get the closest integer, but have ties round up, then you want <code>math.trunc(x + 0.5)</code>.  That way <code>f(3/2)==2</code> and <code>f(1.4)==1</code>.</p>
