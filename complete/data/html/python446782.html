<h3>Question (ID-446782):</h3><h2>Help please--Getting out of a function in Python</h2><p>I want to get out of a function when an exception occurs or so.
I want to use other method than 'return'</p>

<p>Help in this.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>If you catch an exception and then want to rethrow it, <a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/200711/rethrowing_exceptions_in_python.html" rel="nofollow">this pattern</a> is pretty simple:</p>

<pre><code>try:
    do_something_dangerous()
except:
    do_something_to_apologize()
    raise
</code></pre>

<p>Of course if you want to <em>raise</em> the exception in the first place, that's easy, too:</p>

<pre><code>def do_something_dangerous(self):
    raise Exception("Boo!")
</code></pre>

<p>If that's not what you wanted, please provide more information!</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Can't think of another way to "get out" of a function other than a) return, b) throw an exception, or c) terminate execution of the program.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>The exception itself will terminate the function:</p>

<pre><code>def f():
    a = 1 / 0  # will raise an exception
    return a

try:
    f()
except:
    print 'no longer in f()'
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Assuming you want to "stop" execution inside of that method. There's a few things you can do.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Don't catch the exception.</strong> This will return control to the method that called it in the first place. You can then do whatever you want with it. </li>
<li><strong>sys.exit(0)</strong> This one actually exits the entire program.</li>
<li><strong>return</strong> I know you said you don't want return, but hear me out. Return is useful, because based on the value you return, it would be a good way to let your users know what went wrong. </li>
</ol>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Are you looking for yield?</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>As others have pointed out, an exception will get you out of the method.  You shouldn't be ashamed or embarassed by exceptions; an exception indicates an <strong>error</strong>, but that's not necessarily the same as a <strong>bug</strong>.</p>

<p>For example, say I'm writing a factorial function.  Factorial isn't defined for negative numbers, so I might do this:</p>

<pre><code>def factorial(n):
  if n &lt; 0:
    raise ValueError
  if n == 0:
    return 1
  return n*factorial(n-1)
</code></pre>

<p>I would then look for the exception:</p>

<pre><code>n = raw_input('Enter a number.')
try:
  print factorial(n)
except ValueError:
  print 'You entered a negative number.'
</code></pre>

<p>I can make the exception more informative than a ValueError by defining my own:</p>

<pre><code>class NegativeInputError(Exception):
  pass

# in the function:
if n &lt; 0:
  raise NegativeInputError
</code></pre>

<p>HTH!</p>
