<h3>Question (ID-8826521):</h3><h2>Python: avoiding if condition for this code?</h2><p>for the following code </p>

<pre><code>a =func()
if a != None:
    b.append(a)
</code></pre>

<p>a can be assigned to None, is there a way to avoid the if statement and only use one line of code?</p>

<p>original problem is the following</p>

<pre><code>import xml.etree.ElementTree as etree

r = etree.parse(f).getroot()
b = etree.Element('register',{})

a = r.find('tag_name') # a may get None if did not find it
if a != None:
    b.append(a)
</code></pre>

<p>ok, I used all the answers and got this, personally I think it's the most complex python I have ever wrote so far, lol</p>

<pre><code>NS_MAP = {
    'spirit' : 'http://www.spiritconsortium.org/XMLSchema/SPIRIT/1.4',
    'app' : 'http://www.app.com/SPIRIT-app'
    }

mp=etree.Element('MemoryProperty', {'version':'alpha'})
mpt=etree.ElementTree(mp)


def copy_tags(tp, op, p, tn, ns='spirit'):
    c =  p.find('{%s}%s'%(NS_MAP[ns],tn))
    if c is not None:
        (op == '&lt;-') and tp.append(c)
        return c    

for reg in regs:
    te = etree.Element('register',{})
    copy_tags(te,'&lt;-',reg,'name')
    copy_tags(te,'&lt;-',reg,'addressOffset')
    copy_tags(te,'&lt;-',reg,'access')
    (lambda e, t: copy_tags(te,'&lt;-',t,'usageConstraints',ns='app') if t is not None else None)(te, copy_tags(te,'|',reg,'vendorExtensions'))

    mp.append(te)

mpt.write('map_gen.xml')

<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You asked the wrong question here. The clue is in your reply to one of the comments where you say "I have 10+ tags, if I can get 3 line to 1 line, I will save 20+ lines".</p>

<p>So your problem actually is not that you have 3 lines of code but that you are needlessly repeating 3 lines of code over and over. You could use a function to extract the repeated lines, but it sounds like in this case you may actually want a loop:</p>

<pre><code>THE_TAGS = ('tag1', 'tag2', 'and so on')
for tag in THE_TAGS:
    a = r.find(tag) # a may get None if did not find it
    if a != None:
        b.append(a)
</code></pre>

<p>Or if you need to append to different lists:</p>

<pre><code>def extract_tag(r, tag_name, to):
    a = r.find(tag_name) # a may get None if did not find it
    if a != None:
        to.append(a)

extract_tag(r, 'tag1', b)
extract_tag(r, 'tag2', c)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>If you can call func() beforehand, and you want to combine the test and assignment statements into a single statement, then you can do this, with an if-else expression:</p>

<pre><code>b += [a] if a is not None else []
</code></pre>

<p>If a is not None, then this will add [a] to b -- essentially the same operation as b.append(a)</p>

<p>If a <em>is</em> None, then this will add [] to b, which will leave b unchanged.</p>

<p>This won't work unless b is a list, or at least supports "+=" in-place addition. If it doesn't -- perhaps it's some custom object, then you should be able to do this:</p>

<pre><code>(b.append(a) if a is not None else None)
</code></pre>

<p>This is an expression, evaluated for its side effects, and then thrown away. If a is None, then the <code>b.append(a)</code> call will never be executed. In either case, the value of the expression is None, but we don't care about it, so it gets ignored.</p>

<p>Now, if you want to combine the func() call with this, then you'll have to do something different in order to avoid calling func twice. If you can use the "+=" syntax, then you can do it like this:</p>

<pre><code>b += filter(None, [func()])
</code></pre>

<p><code>filter(None, &lt;list&gt;)</code> returns the list with all false elements (None included, but also 0 and []) removed. This statement, then, will add either [func()] or [] to b.</p>

<p><strong>[Edited]</strong></p>

<p>Finally, for the worst case scenario: If you can't call func() more than once, <em>and</em> you can't use <code>b += &lt;list&gt;</code>, <em>and</em> you need to accept 0, "", [], etc, and only exclude <code>None</code>, <em>and</em> you need it all on one line, here's the ugliest line of code yet:</p>

<pre><code>(lambda l, a: l.append(a) if a is not None else None)(b, func())
</code></pre>

<p>This is essentially @ekhumoro's solution, compressed into one line. It defines an anonymous function, calls it, discards the value, and then discards the function, all for the sake of the side effect.</p>

<p>Now, this is a single line, but it's certainly not easier to read or understand than the original code. If I were you, I'd stick with the original, or go with @ekhumoro's idea of just defining a helper function and using that.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Attacking your real problem, and doing it in two lines for clarity:</p>

<pre><code>temp = [r.find(tag) for tag in list_of_tags]
b.extend(x for x in temp if x is not None)
</code></pre>

<p>Note: <code>Element.extend</code> is new in Python 2.7/3.2</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Presumably you're not trying to remove just a single <code>if</code> statement from your code...</p>

<p>So the obvious answer is to use a function:</p>

<pre><code>import xml.etree.ElementTree as etree

def append(parent, child):
    if child is not None:
        parent.append(child)

r = etree.parse(f).getroot()
b = etree.Element('register',{})

append(b, r.find('tag_name'))
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Short answer:  Not really.</p>

<p>Longer answer: If you really wanted to avoid this (perhaps because you want to implement this behavior --- appending only non-None values) from several different blocks of code) then you could create a class as a proxy around the underlying <strong>b</strong> object and hide the details in its append method.</p>

<pre><code>class NonNoneAppender:
    def __init__(self, obj):
        if not hasattr(obj, 'append') or not callable(obj.append):
            raise ValueError, "Object must have append method"
        self.__obj = obj
    def append(self, item):
        if item is not None:
            return self.__obj.append(item)
    def __getattr__(self, attr):
        return getattr( self.__obj, attr)      
</code></pre>

<p>... and then you could do something like:</p>

<pre><code>b = NonNoneAppender(b)
</code></pre>

<p>However, I'm not sure this would make any sense at all for your code.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p><code>b+=list(set([r.find('tag_name')])-set([None]))</code></p>

<p>But it's very ugly. A little cleaner, but also a line longer:</p>

<pre><code>b.append(r.find('tag_name'))
b.remove(None)
</code></pre>

<p>Still not very neat though. If I were you I'd just keep that <code>if</code> statement.</p>
