<h3>Question (ID-661084):</h3><h2>Security of Python's eval() on untrusted strings?</h2><p>If I am evaluating a Python string using eval(), and have a class like:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo(object):
    a = 3
    def bar(self, x): return x + a
</code></pre>

<p>What are the security risks if I do not trust the string? In particular:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is <code>eval(string, {"f": Foo()}, {})</code> unsafe? That is, can you reach os or sys or something unsafe from a Foo instance?</li>
<li>Is <code>eval(string, {}, {})</code> unsafe? That is, can I reach os or sys entirely from builtins like len and list?</li>
<li>Is there a way to make builtins not present at all in the eval context?</li>
</ol>

<p>There are some unsafe strings like "[0] * 100000000" I don't care about, because at worst they slow/stop the program. I am primarily concerned about protecting user data external to the program.</p>

<p>Obviously, <code>eval(string)</code> without custom dictionaries is unsafe in most cases.</p>

<p>There was recently a thread about how to do this kind of thing safely on the python-dev list, and the conclusions were:</p>

<ul>
<li>It's really hard to do this properly.</li>
<li>It requires patches to the python interpreter to block many classes of attacks.</li>
<li>Don't do it unless you really want to.</li>
</ul>

<p>Start here to read about the challenge: <a href="http://tav.espians.com/a-challenge-to-break-python-security.html" rel="nofollow">http://tav.espians.com/a-challenge-to-break-python-security.html</a> </p>

<p>What situation do you want to use eval() in? Are you wanting a user to be able to execute arbitrary expressions? Or are you wanting to transfer data in some way? Perhaps it's possible to lock down the input in some way.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>A normal call to eval is unsafe:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; eval("open('/tmp/tst', 'w')", {}, {})
&lt;open file '/tmp/tst', mode 'w' at 0x7fe8703ce198&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But you can hide the builtin objects by passing a dict of globals that has <code>__builtins__</code> explicitly set:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; eval("open('/tmp/tst', 'w')", {'__builtins__':[]}, {})
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  File "&lt;string&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
NameError: name 'open' is not defined
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure if this prohibits all evil things one could do, but it surely is a step in the right direction...</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You can get to <code>os</code> using builtin functions: <code>__import__('os')</code>.</p>

<p>For python 2.6+, the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/ast.html#ast-helpers" rel="nofollow">ast module</a> may help; in particular <code>ast.literal_eval</code>, although it depends on exactly what you want to eval.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You are probably better off turning the question around: </p>

<ol>
<li>What sort of expressions are you wanting to eval?</li>
<li>Can you insure that only strings matching some narrowly defined syntax are eval()d?</li>
<li>Then consider if <em>that</em> is safe.</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, if you are wanting to let the user enter an algebraic expression for evaluation, consider limiting them to one letter variable names, numbers, and a specific set of operators and functions.  Don't eval() strings containing anything else.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Note that even if you pass empty dictionaries to eval(), it's still possible to segfault (C)Python with some syntax tricks. For example, try this on your interpreter: <code>eval("()"*8**5)</code></p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>There is a very good <a href="http://diveintopython3.org/advanced-iterators.html#eval" rel="nofollow">article on the un-safety of <code>eval()</code></a> in Mark Pilgrim's <a href="http://diveintopython3.org" rel="nofollow">Dive into Python</a> tutorial.</p>

<p>Quoted from this article: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the end, it is possible to safely
  evaluate untrusted Python expressions,
  for some definition of “safe” that
  turns out not to be terribly useful in
  real life. It’s fine if you’re just
  playing around, and it’s fine if you
  only ever pass it trusted input. But
  anything else is just asking for
  trouble.</p>
