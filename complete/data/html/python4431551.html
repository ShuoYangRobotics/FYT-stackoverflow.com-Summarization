<h3>Question (ID-4431551):</h3><h2>Accurate trig in python</h2><p>Straight to the chase I want to create a function which calculates the length of a step.</p>

<p>This is what I have:</p>

<pre><code>def humanstep(angle):
    global human
    human[1]+=math.sin(math.radians(angle))*0.06
    human[2]+=math.cos(math.radians(angle))*0.06
</code></pre>

<p>So if the angle is 90 then the x value (human[1]) should equal 0.06 and the y value equal to 0.</p>

<p>Instead  the conversion between radians and degrees is not quite perfect and these values are returned.</p>

<pre><code>[5.99999999999999, 3.6739403974420643e-16]
</code></pre>

<p>Is there anyway to fix this?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>This is representation error due to how floating point arithmetic works. See the following page from the Python documentation: <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/floatingpoint.html" rel="nofollow">Floating Point Arithmetic: Issues and Limitations</a>.</p>

<p>FTA:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that this is in the very nature of binary floating-point: this is not a bug in Python, and it is not a bug in your code either. You’ll see the same kind of thing in all languages that support your hardware’s floating-point arithmetic (although some languages may not display the difference by default, or in all output modes).</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Exactly how accurate do you want? The above is accurate to 15dp.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If you want <em>accurate</em> results, you are doing it correctly.</p>

<p>If you want mathematically <em>exact</em> results like <code>[6, 0]</code>, use a symbolic math library such as <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sympy/" rel="nofollow">sympy</a></p>

<p>Notice that these are very different goals.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You should read up on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point_numbers" rel="nofollow">floating-point numbers</a>, as these calculations are naturally imperfect and some numbers cannot be represented accurately using Python's floating point numbers. (Obviously, a fixed number of bits cannot represent the infinitely many real numbers.</p>

<p>The short answer is no.  You can round if you want.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>As the others have said, it's floating point error. You can use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/decimal.html" rel="nofollow">Decimal</a> module, which can give you arbitrary precision math</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>If you want to avoid the representation issues inherent in floating-point numbers, you can use a <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/decimal.html" rel="nofollow">Decimal</a>, but you will need to implement your own trigonometric functions. This will get you arbitrary precision but it will be rather slow.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>As everyone has said, this is to do with binary representation issues - 0.06 is not a "round" figure in binary (just like 1/3 is not in decimal).  It has nothing to do with the trig functions.  If you drop them out and just do:</p>

<pre><code>human[1]+=0.06
human[2]+=0.0
</code></pre>

<p>and look at the results you will see the same.</p>

<p>However, in Python 2.7 up the representation of floating point numbers has been improved.  It will now display the shortest decimal number that gives that binary number - in this case I think it would display the answer you expect (only running 2.5 here so I can't quickly test).  See <a href="http://docs.python.org/dev/whatsnew/2.7.html" rel="nofollow">this article</a> for more information.</p>
