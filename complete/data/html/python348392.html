<h3>Question (ID-348392):</h3><h2>Receive and send emails in python</h2><p>How can i receive and send email in python? A 'mail server' of sorts.</p>

<p>I am looking into making an app that listens to see if it recieves an email addressed to foo@bar.domain.com, and sends an email to the sender.</p>

<p>Now, am i able to do this all in python, would it be best to use 3rd party libraries? </p>

<pre><code>import smtplib

server = 'mail.server.com'
user = ''
password = ''

recipients = ['user@mail.com', 'other@mail.com']
sender = 'you@mail.com'
message = 'Hello World'

session = smtplib.SMTP(server)
# if your SMTP server doesn't need authentications,
# you don't need the following line:
session.login(user, password)
session.sendmail(sender, recipients, message)
</code></pre>

<p>For more options, error handling, etc, look at the <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/lib/module-smtplib.html" rel="nofollow">smtplib module documentation</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I do not think it would be a good idea to write a real mail server in Python. This is certainly possible (see mcrute's and Manuel Ceron's posts to have details) but it is a lot of work when you think of everything that a real mail server must handle (queuing, retransmission, dealing with spam, etc).</p>

<p>You should explain in more detail what you need. If you just want to react to incoming email, I would suggest to configure the mail server to call a program when it receives the email. This program could do what it wants (updating a database, creating a file, talking to another Python program).</p>

<p>To call an arbitrary program from the mail server, you have several choices:</p>

<ol>
<li>For sendmail and Postfix, a <code>~/.forward</code> containing <code>"|/path/to/program"</code></li>
<li>If you use procmail, a recipe action of <code>|path/to/program</code></li>
<li>And certainly many others</li>
</ol>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Yes, you can do pretty much everything with the built-in libraries.  Do a search here looking for the tags <code>[python]</code> and <code>[email]</code> and you'll see how it's done.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>poplib and smtplib will be your friends when developing your app.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Python has an SMTPD module that will be helpful to you for writing a server. You'll probably also want the SMTP module to do the re-send. Both modules are in the standard library at least since version 2.3.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Depending on the amount of mail you are sending you might want to look into using a real mail server like postifx or sendmail (*nix systems) Both of those programs have the ability to send a received mail to a program based on the email address. </p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>The sending part has been covered, for the receiving you can use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/poplib.html" rel="nofollow">pop</a> or <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/imaplib.html" rel="nofollow">imap</a></p>
