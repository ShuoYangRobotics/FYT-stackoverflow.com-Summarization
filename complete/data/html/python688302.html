<h3>Question (ID-688302):</h3><h2>How do I make a command line text editor?</h2><p>I have gotten to know my way around a few programming languages, and I'd like to try my hand at making a command-line text editor -- something that runs in the terminal, like vim/emacs/nano, but is pure text (no guis, please). Preferably, I'd like to do this in python. Where do I start? Are there any (python) libraries to do command-line applications?</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Take a look at <a href="http://docs.python.org/howto/curses.html" rel="nofollow">Curses Programming in Python</a> and <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/curses.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> as well. </p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Kids today!  Sheesh!  When I was starting out, curses was not in widespread use!</p>

<p>My first text editors worked on actual mechanical Teletype devices with actual paper (not a philosophical "TTY" device with a scrolling screen!)</p>

<p>This still works nicely as a way to edit. </p>

<p>Use the <code>cmd</code> module to implement a bunch of commands.  Use the 'ex' man page for hints as to what you need.  Do not read about the vi commands; avoid reading about vim.  </p>

<p>Look at older man pages for just the "EX COMMANDS" section.   For example, here: <a href="http://www.manpagez.com/man/1/ex/" rel="nofollow">http://www.manpagez.com/man/1/ex/</a>.</p>

<p>Implement the append, add, change, delete, global, insert, join, list, move, print, quit, substitute and write commands and you'll be happy.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Curses type libraries and resources will get you into the textual user interfaces, and provide very nice, relatively easy to use windows, menus, editors, etc.</p>

<p>Then you'll want to look into code highlighting modules for python.</p>

<p>It's a fun process dealing with the limitations of textual interfaces, and you can learn a lot by going down this road.  Good luck!</p>


<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Another option if you want to write a TUI (Text User Interface) without having to descend to curses is <a href="http://www.wanware.com/tsgdocs/snack.html" rel="nofollow">Snack</a>, which comes with <a href="https://fedorahosted.org/newt/" rel="nofollow">Newt</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I would recommend the excellent urwid toolkit (<a href="http://excess.org/article/2009/03/urwid-0984-released" rel="nofollow">http://excess.org/article/2009/03/urwid-0984-released</a>) - it's much easier to use than straight curses.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>A not very serious suggestions: a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_editor" rel="nofollow">line editor</a> can be implemented without curses.</p>

<p>These things are pretty primitive, of course, and not a lot of fun to work in. But they can be implemented with very little code, and would give you a chance to fool around with various schemes for maintaining the file state in memory pretty quickly.</p>

<p>And they would put you in touch with the programmers of the early seventies (when they had teletypes and the first glass teletypes, but after punched cards were a bit passe...).</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Not quite a reference to a Python library, but <a href="http://www.finseth.com/craft/" rel="nofollow">The Craft of Text Editing</a> by Craig A. Finseth might be of interest you.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>Well, what do you mean by a GUI? If you just want to create something that can be used on a console, look into the <code>curses</code> module in the Python standard library, which allows you to simulate a primitive GUI of sorts on a console.</p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>Another option without curses is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/python-slang/" rel="nofollow">Python Slang</a></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newt%5F%28programming%5Flibrary)" rel="nofollow">Newt</a> is written on top of slang.</p>
