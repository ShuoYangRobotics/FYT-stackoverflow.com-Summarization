<h3>Question (ID-24193):</h3><h2>Python code generator for Visual Studio?</h2><p>I had an idea, if I add a python .py file to my C# project, and tag the file with a custom generator that would execute the python file, and treat the output as the result of the code generation, ie. put it into a C# file, that would allow me to do quite a lot of code generation as part of the build process.</p>

<p>Does anyone know if such a custom generator for Visual Studio 2008 exists?</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I recall that in previous versions of VS, there was a way to add custom build steps to the build process. I used that a lot to do exactly the kind of automated code generation you describe.</p>

<p>I imagine the custom build step feature is still there in 2008.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I don't understand what you are trying to do here. Are you trying to execute a Python script that generates a C# file and then compile that with the project? Or are you trying to compile a Python script to C#?</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>OK, I see. Well, as far as I know there isn't any code generator for Python. There is a good introduction on how to roll your own <a href="http://www.drewnoakes.com/snippets/WritingACustomCodeGeneratorToolForVisualStudio/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>Actually, that's quite an under-used part of the environment, I suppose it's so because it needs you to use the IDE to compile the project, as it'd seem only the IDE knows about these "generators", but MSBuild ignores them.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I dug through my old bookmarks (I love Del.icio.us!) and found this article: <a href="http://blogs.acceleration.net/ryan/articles/577.aspx" rel="nofollow">Code Generation with Python, Cog, and Nant</a>. Keep in mind that anything you can do in NAnt can probably be done in MSBuild as well. This should be enough to get you started.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Yes, they are of course, but I'd still like to have a custom generator, as this would automatically be invoked if I changed the Python file, and thus regenerating the code in question.</p>
