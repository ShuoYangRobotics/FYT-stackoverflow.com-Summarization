<h3>Question (ID-6761898):</h3><h2>How to generate a human friendly unique ID in Python?</h2><p>How do I generate a unique ID value that can be easily passed on via phone or email, that can be easily remembered while still not being easily guessable.</p>

<p>I am using database. But as I am giving away the ID to people I do not want it to be bound to a database. I could do <em>something</em> with the unique ID I already have in database, but cannot use it directly, to avoid it being guessable.</p>

<p>I am using Python and have tried using <code>uuid</code>, but <code>uuid</code> <strong>is too long to be human readable</strong>. </p>

<p><strong>Is there any way to create a human friendly pronounceable ID?</strong></p>

<p>What you want to do is stitch together syllables to create pronounceable pseudo words. You can create syllables in any language you like to make up words that can be pronounced and communicated but don't actually mean anything.</p>

<p>Read the above link for some of the pitfalls you should consider when taking an approach like this.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>How about something like Amazon's payphrases? Convert the binary ID to a sequence of english words.</p>

<p>If you want something with the same range as a UUID, you need to represent 16 bytes.
To keep it reasonable, restrict the phrase to 4 words, so each word represents 4 bytes, or 65536 possibilities, so you'll need a dictionary of 262,144 words.</p>

<p>EDIT:
Actually on reflection what might be better is a sort of mad lib sentence - it will restrict the number of needed words and may make it easier to remember since it has a grammatical structure. It will need to be longer, of course, perhaps something like this:</p>

<p>(a/an/the/#) (adj) (noun) (verb)(tense) (adverb) while (a/an/the/#) (adj) (noun) (verb) (adverb).</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Here's a uuid-based example.  Adjust the 1000000 to increase or decrease the range of your ids.  Since you're reducing the range of the id, you'll probably have to check to see if the ID already exists.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import uuid
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(str(uuid.uuid1())) % 1000000
380539
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(str(uuid.uuid1())) % 1000000
411563
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Sure, but it requires a few more restrictions on your problem space, namely:</p>

<ol>
<li>There is only one thing generating unique IDs</li>
<li>Your items have some concept of a title</li>
<li>You can persist a list of strings</li>
</ol>

<p>Then you'd do something like:</p>

<pre><code>_UID_INTERNALS = set()

def getID(obj):
    if hasattr(obj, 'UID'):
        return obj.UID
    title = obj.title.encode("ascii", errors="ignore")
    title = title.lower()
    title = "-".join(title.split())
    if not title:
        title = "unnamed-object"
    UID = title
    num = 1
    while UID in _UID_INTERNALS:
        UID = title + str(num)
        num += 1
    _UID_INTERNALS.add(UID)
    obj.UID = UID
    return UID
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You can use <code>hash(str(your_id))</code> or strip the hex value of a hash function from <code>hashlib</code> like pointed out above.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>For emails, what I use is:</p>

<pre><code>from base64 import b64encode
from os import urandom
key = b64encode(urandom(9))
</code></pre>

<p>You can increase/decrease the length by changing the number.
Sometimes you will get + and / characters and you can strip them out if you like.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
Since you also want to pass them over the phone maybe <code>b32encode(urandom(5))</code> would be a better choice since it wont give you any lowercase or unusual characters.</p>
