<h3>Question (ID-6304040):</h3><h2>Real world example about how to use property feature in python?</h2><p>I am interested in how to use property in python. I've read the python docs and the example is just toy code in my opinion:</p>

<pre><code>class C(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self._x = None

    @property
    def x(self):
        """I'm the 'x' property."""
        return self._x

    @x.setter
    def x(self, value):
        self._x = value

    @x.deleter
    def x(self):
        del self._x
</code></pre>

<p>I do not know what can I benefit from wrap the _x filed with the property decorator.Why not just implement as:</p>

<pre><code>class C(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.x = None
</code></pre>

<p>I think the property feature is useful in some situation, but when, could you give me some real world examples?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>One simple use case will be to set a read only instance attribute , as you know leading a variable name with one underscore <code>_x</code> in python usually mean it's <em>private</em> (internal use) but sometimes we want to be able to read the instance attribute and not to write it so we can use <code>property</code> for this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class C(object):

        def __init__(self, x):
            self._x = x

        @property
        def x(self):
            return self._x

&gt;&gt;&gt; c = C(1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; c.x
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; c.x = 2

</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Other examples would be validation/filtering of the set attributes (forcing them to be in bounds or acceptable) and lazy evaluation of complex or rapidly changing terms.</p>

<p>Complex calculation hidden behind an attribute:</p>

<pre><code>class PDB_Calculator(object):
    ...
    @property
    def protein_folding_angle(self):
        # number crunching, remote server calls, etc
        # all results in an angle set in 'some_angle'
        # It could also reference a cache, remote or otherwise,
        # that holds the latest value for this angle
        return some_angle

&gt;&gt;&gt; f = PDB_Calculator()
&gt;&gt;&gt; angle = f.protein_folding_angle
&gt;&gt;&gt; angle
44.33276
</code></pre>

<p>Validation:</p>

<pre><code>class Pedometer(object)
    ...
    @property
    def stride_length(self):
        return self._stride_length

    @stride_length.setter
    def stride_length(self, value):
        if value &gt; 10:
            raise ValueError("This pedometer is based on the human stride - a stride length above 10m is not supported")
        else:
            self._stride_length = value
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.archive.org/details/SeanKellyRecoveryfromAddiction" rel="nofollow">"Recovery from Addiction"</a> shows a potential real-world use of properties in Python.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>One thing I've used it for is caching slow-to-look-up, but unchanging, values stored in a database. This generalises to any situation where your attributes require computation or some other long operation (eg. database check, network communication) which you only want to do on demand.</p>

<pre><code>class Model(object):

  def get_a(self):
    if not hasattr(self, "_a"):
      self._a = self.db.lookup("a")
    return self._a

  a = property(get_a)
</code></pre>

<p>This was in a web app where any given page view might only need one particular attribute of this kind, but the underlying objects themselves might have several such attributes - initialising them all on construction would be wasteful, and properties allow me to be flexible in which attributes are lazy and which aren't.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Take a look at <a href="http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2009/02/06/getters-and-setters-in-python/" rel="nofollow">this article</a> for a very practical use. In short, it explains how in Python you can usually ditch explicit getter/setter method, since if you come to need them at some stage you can use <code>property</code> for a seamless implementation.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Property is just an abstraction around a field which give you more control on ways that a  specific field can be manipulated and to do middleware computations. Few of the usages that come to mind is validation and prior initialization and access restriction</p>

<pre><code>@property
def x(self):
    """I'm the 'x' property."""
    if self._x is None:
        self._x = Foo()

    return self._x
</code></pre>
