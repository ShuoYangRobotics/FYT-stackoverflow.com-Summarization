<h3>Question (ID-1854058):</h3><h2>Python web application</h2><p>I want to create a very simple python web app. I don't need Django or any other web framwwork like that. Isn't there a simpler way to create a web app in python?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<pre><code>import web

urls = (
    '/(.*)', 'hello'
)
app = web.application(urls, globals())

class hello:        
    def GET(self, name):
        if not name: 
            name = 'world'
        return 'Hello, ' + name + '!'

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Sure!  <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstarted/helloworld.html" rel="nofollow">For example</a>, </p>

<pre><code>print 'Content-Type: text/plain'
print ''
print 'Hello, world!'
</code></pre>

<p>this is a web app -- if you save it into a file in an appropriate directory of a machine running a web server and set the server's configuration properly (depending on the server); the article I pointed to specifically shows how to deploy this web app to Google App Engine, but just about any web server can serve <a href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.illinois.edu/cgi/intro.html" rel="nofollow">CGI</a> apps, and this is a simple example thereof.</p>

<p>Of course, CGI has its limits, and you can use more sophisticated approaches (still short of a framework!) such as <a href="http://wsgi.org/wsgi/" rel="nofollow">WSGI</a> (also universally supported, if nothing else because it can run on top of CGI -- but in most cases you can also deploy it in more advanced ways) and possibly some of the many excellent utility <a href="http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/" rel="nofollow">components</a> you can deploy with WSGI to save you work in coding certain parts of your apps.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web%5FServer%5FGateway%5FInterface" rel="nofollow">WSGI</a> is probably what you are looking for. Though there are several lightweight python <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/WebFrameworks" rel="nofollow">web frameworks</a> around which are less monolithic than django.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The truth is that you do need a framework of some sort even if it's extremely minimal. You can use WSGI as a base and at least you're doing a little better. Python is a very powerful, very unspecific programming language so if you decide to do it without a framework you're going to have to rewrite huge amounts of code that you may be taking for granted. </p>

<p>If you do decide to go with something other than Django try <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/WebFrameworks" rel="nofollow">this list</a> and maybe you'll find something simple enough that you'll feel good about it. :)</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/" rel="nofollow">Django</a> is actually quite simple, are you sure you don't want to use it?  It can be as simple as you need it to be.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Yep WSGI...</p>

<pre><code>def hello_wsgi(environ, start_response):
    start_response('200 OK', [('content-type', 'text/html')])
    return ['Hello world!']
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to abstract this in terms of request/response to get a little further away from http try <a href="http://pythonpaste.org/webob/" rel="nofollow">webob</a>.</p>

<pre><code>from webob import Request, Response

def hello_wsgi(environ, start_response):
    request = Request(environ)
    #do something with the request
    #return a response
    return Response("Hello World!")(environ, start_response)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I use <a href="http://bottlepy.org" rel="nofollow">bottle</a> all the time as a minimal web framework.
It is very simple to use.</p>

<p>as a minimum example - taken from the web site :</p>

<pre><code>from bottle import route, run

@route('/hello/:name')
def index(name='World'):
    return '&lt;b&gt;Hello %s!&lt;/b&gt;' % name

run(host='localhost', port=8080)
</code></pre>

<p>you simply associate url (route) to functions. This one even get an optional argument.
It has an optional light templating language, and you can tweak it a lot for our needs. Very powerful.</p>

<p>It is also very easy to instal - as it comes as a single file, standing along your app, and is pure compliant python. It is also very easy to debug, with a nice autoreload on modif while in development mode.</p>

<p>As a final advantages,  it runs smoothly under pypy - thus providing a speed boost over other frameworks.</p>
