<h3>Question (ID-874757):</h3><h2>Python IDLE subprocess error?</h2><blockquote>
  <p>IDLE's subprocess didn't make
  connection. Either IDLE can't start a
  subprocess or personal firewall
  software is blocking the connection.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don't think this has been asked-how come this comes up occasionally when running very simple programs-I then have to go to Task Manager &amp; stop all Pythonw processes to get it to work again?</p>

<p>It seems to happen randomnly on different bits of code-here is the one I'm doing at the moment-</p>

<pre><code>f = open('money.txt')
currentmoney = float(f.readline())
print(currentmoney, end='')
howmuch = (float(input('How much did you put in or take out?:')))
now = currentmoney + howmuch
print(now)
f.close()
f = open('money.txt', 'w')
f.write(str(now))
f.close()
</code></pre>

<p>Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't!</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>In Python 3.0.1, I have gotten that error after I Ctrl-C to interrupt a previous run of a program in Idle's Python Shell and then try to run a script.</p>

<p>Also in 3.0.1: Let's say you have two Idle windows open: a script open for editing in one, and Idle's Python Shell window.  I have found that if you close the shell window and then immediately try to run the script, it will give that error when it tries to re-open the shell - but not if you wait a bit in between to let Idle do whatever connection clean up it needs to do.</p>

<p>Worse bugs I have found (again, in v3.0.1- not sure if this would happen in the 2.x versions):
I had a long script - getting up towards 9k lines - and once it got to a certain size, doing "save as" on it would crash Idle.  I am not sure what the exact threshold was for size - but before that, I would also get some intermittent "save as" crashes that seemed to depend on what else I had going on - other Idle windows, how much output was in the shell window perhaps - stuff like that.  It can crash and you will lose unsaved work.</p>

<p>Also - one thing I commonly do is have a scratch window open where I cut and paste bits of code in various stages of validity, write notes to myself, etc - so not a valid python script, but I sometimes save these so I can come back to them.  I have one such file that will crash Idle every time I try to open it - and I lost unsaved work the first time.  (FYI: Other editors including PythonWin 2.5.2 have no problem opening the file.)</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Can you be more specific by providing a short code sample?</p>

<p>IDLE has some threading issues. So the first thing to debug your problem would be to print some simple stuff in your subprocess. Thereby you will see whether it is a network or threading related issue.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>If it look like truly random behavior than it could be a multi-cpu/core issue.
You could try to set the interpreter affinity to a fixed cpu and see if this issue still comes up.</p>

<p>Google for something like: imagecfg process affinity
For more information about that.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Or..you could forget IDLE and try <a href="http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/" rel="nofollow">IPython</a> instead.  It may not exhibit the same error at all.  I've never had a problem with it. You get some cool functionality with it that IDLE doesn't have.  I find it very useful when working with Python.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Simple. Just cut all files with .py extension, paste them in a place different from the os path, one of the files is causing such error. Run the IDLE again.</p>
