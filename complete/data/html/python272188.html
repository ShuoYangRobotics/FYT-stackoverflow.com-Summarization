<h3>Question (ID-272188):</h3><h2>Code Coverage and Unit Testing of Python Code</h2><p>I have already visited <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/191673/preferred-python-unit-testing-framework">Preferred Python unit-testing framework</a>. I am not just looking at Python Unit Testing Framework, but also code coverage with respect to unit tests. So far I have only come across <a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/code/modules/coverage.html" rel="nofollow">coverage.py</a>. Is there any better option?</p>

<p>An interesting option for me is to integrate <a href="http://www.python.org/" rel="nofollow">cpython</a>, unit testing of Python code and code coverage of Python code with Visual Studio 2008 through plugins (something similar to <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/IronPythonStudio" rel="nofollow">IronPython Studio</a>). What can be done to achieve this? I look forward to suggestions.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>There is also <a href="http://darcs.idyll.org/~t/projects/figleaf/doc/" rel="nofollow">figleaf</a> which I think is based on Ned Batchelder's coverage.py. We use <a href="http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/" rel="nofollow">nose</a> as the driver for the testing. It all works pretty well. We write our unit tests using the built-in unittest and doctest modules.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>PyDev seems to allow code coverage from within Eclipse. </p>

<p>I've yet to find how to integrate that with my own (rather complex) build process, so I use Ned Batchelder's coverage.py at the command line.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>NetBeans' new Python support has tightly integrated code coverage support - <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/tor/entry/netbeans_screenshot_of_the_week6" rel="nofollow">more info here</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>If you want interactive code coverage, where you can see your coverage stats change in real time, take a look at <a href="http://www.softwareverify.com/python/coverage/index.html" rel="nofollow">Python Coverage Validator</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.testoob.org" rel="nofollow">Testoob</a> has a neat "<code>--coverage</code>" command-line option to generate a coverage report.</p>
