<h3>Question (ID-1835018):</h3><h2>Python: check if an object is a list or tuple (but not string)</h2><p>This is what I normally do in order to ascertain that the input is a <code>list</code>/<code>tuple</code> - but not a <code>str</code>. Because many times I stumbled upon bugs where a function passes a <code>str</code> object by mistake, and the target function does <code>for x in lst</code> assuming that <code>lst</code> is actually a <code>list</code> or <code>tuple</code>.</p>

<pre><code>assert isinstance(lst, (list, tuple))
</code></pre>

<p>My question is: is there a better way of achieving this?</p>

<pre><code>assert not isinstance(lst, basestring)
</code></pre>

<p>Is actually what you want, otherwise you'll miss out on a lot of things which act like lists, but aren't subclasses of <code>list</code> or <code>tuple</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Remember that in Python we want to use "duck typing".  So, anything that acts like a list can be treated as a list.  So, don't check for the type of a list, just see if it acts like a list.</p>

<p>But strings act like a list too, and often that is not what we want.  There are times when it is even a problem!  So, check explicitly for a string, but then use duck typing.</p>

<p>Here is a function I wrote for fun.  It is a special version of <code>repr()</code> that prints any sequence in angle brackets ('&lt;', '>').</p>

<pre><code>def srepr(arg):
    if isinstance(arg, basestring): # Python 3: isinstance(arg, str)
        return repr(arg)
    try:
        return '&lt;' + ", ".join(srepr(x) for x in arg) + '&gt;'
    except TypeError: # catch when for loop fails
        return repr(arg) # not a sequence so just return repr
</code></pre>

<p>This is clean and elegant, overall.  But what's that <code>isinstance()</code> check doing there?  That's kind of a hack.  But it is essential.</p>

<p>This function calls itself recursively on anything that acts like a list.  If we didn't handle the string specially, then it would be treated like a list, and split up one character at a time.  But then the recursive call would try to treat each character as a list -- and it would work!  Even a one-character string works as a list!  The function would keep on calling itself recursively until stack overflow.</p>

<p>Functions like this one, that depend on each recursive call breaking down the work to be done, have to special-case strings--because you can't break down a string below the level of a one-character string, and even a one-character string acts like a list.</p>

<p>Note: the <code>try</code>/<code>except</code> is the cleanest way to express our intentions.  But if this code were somehow time-critical, we might want to replace it with some sort of test to see if <code>arg</code> is a sequence.  Rather than testing the type, we should probably test behaviors.  If it has a <code>.strip()</code> method, it's a string, so don't consider it a sequence; otherwise, if it is indexable or iterable, it's a sequence:</p>

<pre><code>def is_sequence(arg):
    return (not hasattr(arg, "strip") and
            hasattr(arg, "__getitem__") or
            hasattr(arg, "__iter__"))

def srepr(arg):
    if is_sequence(arg):
        return '&lt;' + ", ".join(srepr(x) for x in arg) + '&gt;'
    return repr(arg)
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: I originally wrote the above with a check for <code>__getslice__()</code> but I noticed that in the <code>collections</code> module documentation, the interesting method is <code>__getitem__()</code>; this makes sense, that's how you index an object.  That seems more fundamental than <code>__getslice__()</code> so I changed the above.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Also check out the <code>types</code> module:</p>

<pre><code>import types

assert isinstance(x, types.ListType)
assert not isinstance(x, types.StringTypes)
</code></pre>

<p>and so on...</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Generally speaking, the fact that a function which iterates over an object works on strings as well as tuples and lists is more feature than bug.  You certainly <em>can</em> use <code>isinstance</code> or duck typing to check an argument, but why should you?</p>

<p>That sounds like a rhetorical question, but it isn't.  The answer to "why should I check the argument's type?" is probably going to suggest a solution to the real problem, not the perceived problem.  Why is it a bug when a string is passed to the function?  Also:  if it's a bug when a string is passed to this function, is it also a bug if some other non-list/tuple iterable is passed to it?  Why, or why not?</p>

<p>I think that the most common answer to the question is likely to be that developers who write <code>f("abc")</code> are expecting the function to behave as though they'd written <code>f(["abc"])</code>.  There are probably circumstances where it makes more sense to protect developers from themselves than it does to support the use case of iterating across the characters in a string.  But I'd think long and hard about it first.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>The <code>str</code> object doesn't have an <code>__iter__</code> attribute</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; hasattr('', '__iter__')
False
</code></pre>

<p>so you can do a check</p>

<pre><code>assert hasattr(x, '__iter__')
</code></pre>

<p>and this will also raise a nice <code>AssertionError</code> for any other non-iterable object too.</p>

<p><em>Edit:</em>
As Tim mentions in the comments, this will only work in python 2.x, not 3.x</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Python with PHP flavor:</p>

<pre><code>def is_array(var):
    return isinstance(var, (list, tuple))
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I tend to do this (if I really, really had to):</p>

<pre><code>for i in some_var:
   if type(i) == type(list()):
       #do something with a list
   elif type(i) == type(tuple()):
       #do something with a tuple
   elif type(i) == type(str()):
       #here's your string
</code></pre>
