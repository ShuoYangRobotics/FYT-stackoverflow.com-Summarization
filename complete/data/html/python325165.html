<h3>Question (ID-325165):</h3><h2>Is there a library that will detect the source code language of a block of code?</h2><p>Writing a python script and it needs to find out what language a block of code is written in. <strong>I could easily write this myself, but I'd like to know if a solution already exists.</strong></p>

<p>Pygments is insufficient and unreliable.</p>

<p>[EDIT]J.F. Sebastian pointed me to <a href="http://pygments.org/" rel="nofollow">Pygments</a> (see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/325165/is-there-a-library-that-will-detect-the-source-code-language-of-a-block-of-code#325521">this answer</a>)</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><a href="http://pygments.org" rel="nofollow">Pygments</a> can guess too. Here is an example from the documentation:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from pygments.lexers import guess_lexer, guess_lexer_for_filename

&gt;&gt;&gt; guess_lexer('#!/usr/bin/python\nprint "Hello World!"')
&lt;pygments.lexers.PythonLexer&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; guess_lexer_for_filename('test.py', 'print "Hello World!"')
&lt;pygments.lexers.PythonLexer&gt;
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Ohcount has been developed for this exactly:
<a href="http://labs.ohloh.net/ohcount" rel="nofollow">http://labs.ohloh.net/ohcount</a></p>

<p>They are using it at www.ohloh.net to count the contribution of people in languages.</p>

<p>The bad news is that it is coded in ruby, but I am sure that you can integrate it one way or the other in python.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Vim uses a bunch of interesting tests and regular expressions to look for certain file formats. You can look at the vim instruction file at <code>vim/vim71/filetype.vim</code>, or <a href="http://vim.cybermirror.org/runtime/filetype.vim" rel="nofollow">here online</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>This can be a little difficult to do reliably. For example, what language is the following:</p>

<pre><code>print("blah");
</code></pre>

<p>The most reliable way (aside from having the user select the correct language, of course) is to check if the first line is starts with <code>#!</code> ("hashbang") - whatever is after this is the intepreter for the scripting language.</p>

<p>That will work reliably for a lot of scripting languages (including python, shell scripting, perl, ruby etc etc..), but not for compiled languages..</p>

<p>You could look for unique syntax stylings, or specific keywords and weight each one towards a specific language. For example <code>$#somevar</code> is probably Perl. <code>somevar.each do |another| ..... end</code> is probably ruby.. but this would end up being a <em>lot</em> of work, and will not always work (especially with short code blocks)</p>

<p>The other obvious way is to use the file-extension. If it's <code>*.pl</code> it's probably Perl code..</p>

<p>What are you trying to achieve? If you want to syntax highlight, look at what <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/" rel="nofollow">google-code-prettify</a> does - basically a reasonably intelligent, generic syntax highlighter..</p>

<p>In the above above ambiguous example, <code>print</code> is probably a statement or function name, <code>"blah"</code> is probably a string. If you highlight those two differently, you've successfully highlighted a <em>lot</em> of different languages, without having to detect what one it actually is.. but that may not always work, depending on the task..</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><blockquote>
  <p>what language a block of code is written in</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What are your alternatives, among what languages? There is no way to determine this universally. But if you narrow your focus there is probably a tool somewhere</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>You can check highlight.js which automatically highlights the code block, they say they are using some kind of heuristic methods to accomplish this <a href="http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/" rel="nofollow">http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/</a> </p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>As other have said Pygments will be your best bet.</p>
