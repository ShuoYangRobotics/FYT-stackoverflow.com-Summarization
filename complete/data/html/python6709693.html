<h3>Question (ID-6709693):</h3><h2>Calculating the similarity of two lists</h2><p>I have two lists:</p>

<p>eg.
a = [1,8,3,9,4,9,3,8,1,2,3]
and
b = [1,8,1,3,9,4,9,3,8,1,2,3]</p>

<p>Both contain ints. There is no meaning behind the ints (eg. 1 is not 'closer' to 3 than it is to 8). </p>

<p>I'm trying to devise an algorithm to calculate the similarity between two ORDERED lists. Ordered is keyword right here (so I can't just take the set of both lists and calculate their set_difference percentage). Sometimes numbers do repeat (for example 3, 8, and 9 above, and I cannot ignore the repeats).</p>

<p>In the example above, the function I would call would tell me that a and b are ~90% similar for example. How can I do that? Edit distance was something which came to mind. I know how to use it with strings but I'm not sure how to use it with a list of ints. Thanks!</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>It sounds like edit (or Levenshtein) distance is precisely the right tool for the job.</p>

<p>Here is one Python implementation that can be used on lists of integers: <a href="http://hetland.org/coding/python/levenshtein.py" rel="nofollow">http://hetland.org/coding/python/levenshtein.py</a></p>

<p>Using that code, <code>levenshtein([1,8,3,9,4,9,3,8,1,2,3], [1,8,1,3,9,4,9,3,8,1,2,3])</code> returns <code>1</code>, which is the edit distance.</p>

<p>Given the edit distance and the lengths of the two arrays, computing a "percentage similarity" metric should be pretty trivial.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You can use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/difflib.html" rel="nofollow">difflib</a> module  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ratio()<br>
  Return a measure of the sequencesâ€™ similarity as a float in the range [0, 1].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which gives :</p>

<pre><code> &gt;&gt;&gt; s1=[1,8,3,9,4,9,3,8,1,2,3]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; s2=[1,8,1,3,9,4,9,3,8,1,2,3]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; sm=difflib.SequenceMatcher(None,s1,s2)
 &gt;&gt;&gt; sm.ratio()
 0.9565217391304348
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Just use the same algorithm for calculating edit distance on strings if the values don't have any particular meaning.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Unless im missing the point.</p>

<pre><code>from __future__ import division

def similar(x,y):
    si = 0
    for a,b in zip(x, y):
        if a == b:
            si += 1
    return (si/len(x)) * 100


if __name__ in '__main__':
    a = [1,8,3,9,4,9,3,8,1,2,3] 
    b = [1,8,1,3,9,4,9,3,8,1,2,3]
    result = similar(a,b)
    if result is not None:
        print "%s%s Similar!" % (result,'%')
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>One way to tackle this is to utilize <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram" rel="nofollow">histogram</a>. As an example (demonstration with <a href="http://www.numpy.org/" rel="nofollow">numpy</a>):</p>

<pre><code>In []: a= array([1,8,3,9,4,9,3,8,1,2,3])
In []: b= array([1,8,1,3,9,4,9,3,8,1,2,3])

In []: a_c, _= histogram(a, arange(9)+ 1)
In []: a_c
Out[]: array([2, 1, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 4])

In []: b_c, _= histogram(b, arange(9)+ 1)
In []: b_c
Out[]: array([3, 1, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 4])

In []: (a_c- b_c).sum()
Out[]: -1
</code></pre>

<p>There exist now plethora of ways to harness <code>a_c</code> and <code>b_c</code>.  </p>

<p>Where the (seemingly) simplest similarity measure is:</p>

<pre><code>In []: 1- abs(-1/ 9.)
Out[]: 0.8888888888888888
</code></pre>

<p>Followed by:</p>

<pre><code>In []: norm(a_c)/ norm(b_c)
Out[]: 0.92796072713833688
</code></pre>

<p>and:</p>

<pre><code>In []: a_n= (a_c/ norm(a_c))[:, None]
In []: 1- norm(b_c- dot(dot(a_n, a_n.T), b_c))/ norm(b_c)
Out[]: 0.84445724579043624
</code></pre>

<p>Thus, you need to be much more specific to find out most suitable similarity measure suitable for your purposes.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I've implemented something for a similar task a long time ago. Now, I have only <a href="http://pgraycode.wordpress.com/2009/09/21/uniformity/" rel="nofollow">a blog entry for that</a>. It was simple: you had to compute the pdf of both sequences then it would find the common area covered by the graphical representation of pdf.</p>

<p>Sorry for the broken images on link, the external server that I've used back then is dead now.</p>

<p>Right now, for your problem the code translates to</p>

<pre><code>def overlap(pdf1, pdf2):
    s = 0
    for k in pdf1:
        if pdf2.has_key(k):
            s += min(pdf1[k], pdf2[k])
    return s

def pdf(l):
    d = {}
    s = 0.0
    for i in l:
        s += i
        if d.has_key(i):
            d[i] += 1
        else:
            d[i] = 1
    for k in d:
        d[k] /= s
    return d

def solve():
    a = [1, 8, 3, 9, 4, 9, 3, 8, 1, 2, 3]
    b = [1, 8, 1, 3, 9, 4, 9, 3, 8, 1, 2, 3]
    pdf_a = pdf(a)
    pdf_b = pdf(b)
    print pdf_a
    print pdf_b
    print overlap(pdf_a, pdf_b)
    print overlap(pdf_b, pdf_a)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    solve()
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, it gives an unexpected answer, only <code>0.212292609351</code></p>
