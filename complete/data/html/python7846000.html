<h3>Question (ID-7846000):</h3><h2>Finding the label preceding the longest line in a file</h2><p>I have a file that follows a format of</p>

<pre><code>_line 1
this is a string on a line
_line 2
this is another string
_line 3
short line
</code></pre>

<p>I am trying to write some Python code to get me the _line X label of the string below it that has the longest string length. Can you help me fix my code please? Here is what I have so far.</p>

<pre><code>f = open('test.txt', 'r')
print f

read="null"
top_read_line_length="0"
topreadline="null"
for line in f:
    checkifread=line.find('line')
    if checkifread==1:
        print "Read label found"
        #means we are on a read line
        currentread=line
    else:
        #We are on a sequence line for currentread.
        currentlength=len(line)
        print currentlength
    print top_read_line_length

    if int(top_read_line_length) &lt; int(currentlength):
        print topreadline
        topreadline=currentread#now topreadline label is the "_line" string
        topreadlinelength=int(currentlength)
        print topreadline

        #go to next line

print "Done"
print "Longest line is...."
print topreadline

<br /><h3>Answers (Total-12):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>If all you wanted were the longest line in the file (like the question title says), then this one is shockingly simple in modern Python:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; max(open('test.txt'), key=len)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>To fetch the label of the longest line, build a mapping of labels to line-lengths</p>

<p>In your sample dataset, it looks like labels startwith "_line " and the corresponding line immediately follows:</p>

<pre><code>label2linelength = {}
for line in open('test.txt'):
    if line.startswith('_line '):
        label = line
    else:
        label2linelength[label] = len(line)
    lastline = line
print max(label2linelength.items(), key=lambda kv: kv[1])
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>That is easy to achieve:</p>

<pre><code>data = open('test.txt').readlines()
max_line_pos = data.index(max(data, key=len))
prev_line = data[max_line_pos-1]
print prev_line
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I'd do something like:</p>

<pre><code>label = None
maxlen = 0
maxstr = ''
maxlabel = None
with open('f.txt') as f:
  for line in f:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if line.startswith('_line'):
      label = line
    elif len(line) &gt; maxlen:
      maxlen = len(line)
      maxstr = line
      maxlabel = label
print maxlabel, maxstr
</code></pre>

<p>It's a little bit more generic than the problem statement in that it allows multiple lines of text per label.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I'd elaborate on Raymond's answer; if grouper() were available in the standard lib this answer would be quite close to a oneliner again; unluckily it isn't, grouper is only defined in <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/itertools.html" rel="nofollow">itertools examples.</a></p>

<p>I think you'd prefer this version since it's functional. I didn't test its performance, but at least I'm not opening the file and seeking twice nor I'm keeping the whole contents in memory.</p>

<pre><code>from itertools import izip_longest
def grouper(n, iterable, fillvalue=None):
    "grouper(3, 'ABCDEFG', 'x') --&gt; ABC DEF Gxx"
    args = [iter(iterable)] * n
    return izip_longest(fillvalue=fillvalue, *args)

max( grouper(2, open("test.txt")), key=lambda x:len(x[1]))[0]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Another concise variant:</p>

<pre><code>from itertools import imap, izip
from operator import itemgetter
with open("a.py") as f:
    res = max(izip(f, imap(len, f)), key=itemgetter(1))[0]
</code></pre>

<p>This treats every other line as a label.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Here's my one.  It works where a few of the other answers here would fail, e.g. an input file like </p>

<pre><code>_line 1
abc
_line 2
defg
_line 3
hij
</code></pre>

<p>But it does rely on the format of the file being just how you said it was.  </p>

<pre><code>with open('test.txt') as f:
  spam = f.readlines()

labels = spam[0::2]
lines = spam[1::2]

d = dict(zip(labels, lines))

longest_lines_label = max(d, key=lambda x: len(d[x]))

print "Longest line is...."
print longest_lines_label, d[longest_lines_label]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>If you are sure the data is correct and don't need any error handling this should do the job:</p>

<pre><code>lines = open('test.txt', 'r').readlines()
print max([(len(lines[i+1]), lines[i])
           for i in xrange(0, len(lines), 2)])[1].strip()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>Here's an <code>awk</code> program that will do it:</p>

<pre><code>BEGIN { best=""; best_length=0; current=""; }
/^_/ { current=$0; }
/^[^_]/ { if(length($0) &gt; best_length) { best=current; best_length=length($0); }}
END { print "Longest line: "best" with length: "best_length }
</code></pre>

<p>(I like it better than the following <code>python</code> version, which more closely answers your question....)</p>

<pre><code>best = ""
best_length = 0
current = ""
for line in f:  #( assumes f = open(...) from your code )
  if line[:5] == '_line':
    current = line.strip()
    continue
  else:
    if len(line) &gt; best_length:
      best = current
      best_length = len(line.strip())
print "Longest line is: %s with length: %d" % (best,best_length)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>This is fairly short, and works even if you have multiple lines of text after each label</p>

<pre><code>content = list(open("test.txt"))
longest = content.index(max(content, key=len))
label = [ x for x in content[0:longest] if x.startswith("_line") ][-1]
print label.replace("_line ","")
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#10</b><br /><p>And here's yet another way:</p>

<pre><code>import re, mmap

with open("test.txt", "rb") as f:
    mm = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0, mmap.MAP_PRIVATE, mmap.PROT_READ)
    print max(re.finditer(r'_line (\d+)\n(.*)', mm),
              key=lambda m: len(m.group(2))).group(1)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#11</b><br /><p>Here's your code, fixed:</p>

<pre><code>f = open('test.txt', 'r')
print f

read = None
top_read_line_length = 0
topreadline = None
currentlength = 0
label_line = True
for line in f:  
    if label_line:
        label_line = False
        print "label line", line
        #means we are on a read line
        currentread = line
    else:
        label_line = True
        #We are on a sequence line for currentread.
        currentlength = len(line)
        print 'cl', currentlength
    print top_read_line_length

    if top_read_line_length &lt; currentlength:
        print 'trl', topreadline
        topreadline = currentread #now topreadline label is the "_line" string
        top_read_line_length = currentlength
        print 'trl', topreadline

        #go to next line

print "Done"
print "Longest line is...."
print topreadline
</code></pre>

<p>I added a <code>label_line</code> boolean to switch back and forth between lable-lines and data-lines, but the important pieces were:</p>

<ul>
<li>put enough info on your print lines to see what's going on; and</li>
<li>be consistent with your variable names</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem was in the last <code>if</code> suite -- you were checking <code>top_read_line_length</code> but were setting <code>topreadlinelength</code> (no underscores).</p>
