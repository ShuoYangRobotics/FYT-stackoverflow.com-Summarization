<h3>Question (ID-2703029):</h3><h2>Why regular expression's "non-capturing" group is not working</h2><p>In my snippet below, the non-capturing group <code>"(?:aaa)"</code> should be ignored in matching result,
so the result should be <code>"_bbb"</code> only.<br>
However, I get <code>"aaa_bbb"</code> in matching result; only when I specify group(2) does it show <code>"_bbb"</code>.</p>

<pre><code>import re

string1 = "aaa_bbb"
print(re.match(r"(?:aaa)(_bbb)", string1).group())

&gt;&gt;&gt; aaa_bbb
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I think you're misunderstanding the concept of a "non-capturing group". The text matched by a non-capturing group still becomes part of the overall regex match.</p>

<p>Both the regex <code>(?:aaa)(_bbb)</code> and the regex <code>(aaa)(_bbb)</code> return <code>aaa_bbb</code> as the overall match.  The difference is that the first regex has one capturing group which returns <code>_bbb</code> as its match, while the second regex has two capturing groups that return <code>aaa</code> and <code>_bbb</code> as their respective matches.  In your Python code, to get <code>_bbb</code>, you'd need to use <code>group(1)</code> with the first regex, and <code>group(2)</code> with the second regex.</p>

<p>The main benefit of non-capturing groups is that you can add them to a regex without upsetting the numbering of the capturing groups in the regex.  They also offer (slightly) better performance as the regex engine doesn't have to keep track of the text matched by non-capturing groups.</p>

<p>If you really want to exclude <code>aaa</code> from the overall regex match then you need to use <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/lookaround.html" rel="nofollow">lookaround</a>.  In this case, positive lookbehind does the trick: <code>(?&lt;=aaa)_bbb</code>.  With this regex, <code>group()</code> returns <code>_bbb</code> in Python.  No capturing groups needed.</p>

<p>My recommendation is that if you have the ability to use capturing groups to get part of the regex match, use that method instead of lookaround.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><code>group()</code> and <code>group(0)</code> will return the entire match. Subsequent groups are actual capture groups.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print (re.match(r"(?:aaa)(_bbb)", string1).group(0))
aaa_bbb
&gt;&gt;&gt; print (re.match(r"(?:aaa)(_bbb)", string1).group(1))
_bbb
&gt;&gt;&gt; print (re.match(r"(?:aaa)(_bbb)", string1).group(2))
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in ?
IndexError: no such group

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><a href="http://docs.python.org/library/re.html#match-objects" rel="nofollow">TFM</a>:</p>

<p>class re.MatchObject</p>

<p>group([group1, ...])</p>

<p>Returns one or more subgroups of the match. If there is a single argument, the result is a single string; if there are multiple arguments, the result is a tuple with one item per argument. <strong>Without arguments, group1 defaults to zero (the whole match is returned). If a groupN argument is zero, the corresponding return value is the entire matching string.</strong></p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Try:</p>

<pre><code>print(re.match(r"(?:aaa)(_bbb)", string1).group(1))
</code></pre>

<p><code>group()</code> is same as <code>group(0)</code> and Group <code>0</code> is always present and it's the <strong>whole RE</strong> match.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You have to specify <code>group(1)</code> to get just the part captured by the parenthesis (<code>_bbb</code> in this case).</p>

<p><code>group()</code> without parameters will return the whole string the complete regular expression matched, no matter if some parts of it were additionally captured by parenthesis or not.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Thanks for answers, so I cannot just simply do like<br>
regex: <code>"(?:a.*)b.*(?:c.*)d.*"</code> for returning matching content of <code>"b.*d.*"</code><br>
<br>
Instead, I have to<br>
<code>"(?:a.*)(b.*)(?:c.*)(d.*)"</code> and combine group(1) + group(2) to get <code>"b.*d.*"</code>  </p>

<p>correct?</p>

<p>AFAIK, the look around thing (?&lt;=...) has limitation of fixed length. :(</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Use the groups method on the match object instead of group.  It returns a list of all capture buffers.  The group method with no argument is returning the entire match of the regular expression.</p>
