<h3>Question (ID-393637):</h3><h2>Django + FastCGI - randomly raising OperationalError</h2><p>I'm running a Django application. Had it under Apache + mod_python before, and it was all OK. Switched to Lighttpd + FastCGI. Now I randomly get the following exception (neither the place nor the time where it appears seem to be predictable). Since it's random, and it appears only after switching to FastCGI, I assume it has something to do with some settings.</p>

<p>Found a few results when googleing, but they seem to be related to setting maxrequests=1. However, I use the default, which is 0.</p>

<p>Any ideas where to look for?</p>

<p>PS. I'm using PostgreSQL. Might be related to that as well, since the exception appears when making a database query.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

OperationalError: server closed the connection unexpectedly
       This probably means the server terminated abnormally
       before or while processing the request.

<br /><h3>Answers (Total-11):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I fixed a similar issue when using a geodjango model that was not using the default ORM for one of its functions. When I added a line to manually close the connection the error went away.</p>

<p><a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/9437" rel="nofollow">http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/9437</a></p>

<p>I still see the error randomly (~50% of requests) when doing stuff with user login/sessions however.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>In the switch, did you change PostgreSQL client/server versions?</p>

<p>I have seen similar problems with php+mysql, and the culprit was an incompatibility between the client/server versions (even though they had the same major version!)</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Smells like a possible threading problem. Django is <em>not</em> guaranteed thread-safe although the in-file docs seem to indicate that Django/FCGI can be run that way. Try running with prefork and then beat the crap out of the server. If the problem goes away ...</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Maybe the PYTHONPATH and PATH environment variable is different for both setups (Apache+mod_python and lighttpd + FastCGI).</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>In the end I switched back to Apache + mod_python (I was having other random errors with fcgi, besides this one) and everything is good and stable now.</p>

<p>The question still remains open. In case anybody has this problem in the future and solves it they can record the solution here for future reference. :)</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Have you considered downgrading to Python 2.5.x (2.5.4 specifically)?  I don't think Django would be considered mature on Python 2.6 since there are some backwards incompatible changes.  However, I doubt this will fix your problem.</p>

<p>Also, Django 1.0.2 fixed some nefarious little bugs so make sure you're running that.  This very well could fix your problem.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I went through the same problem recently (lighttpd, fastcgi &amp; postgre). Searched for a solution for days without success, and as a last resort switched to mysql. The problem is gone.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Why not storing session in cache?
Set</p>

<pre><code>SESSION_ENGINE = "django.contrib.sessions.backends.cache"
</code></pre>

<p>Also you can try use postgres with <em>pgbouncer</em> (postgres - prefork server and don't like many connects/disconnects per time), but firstly check your postgresql.log.</p>

<p>Another version - you have many records in session tables and <em>django-admin.py cleanup</em> can help.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>The problem could be mainly with Imports. Atleast thats what happened to me.
I wrote my own solution after finding nothing from the web. Please check my blogpost here: <a href="http://nandakishore.posterous.com/simple-djangopython-utility-to-check-all-the" rel="nofollow">Simple Python Utility to check all Imports in your project</a></p>

<p>Ofcourse this will only help you to get to the solution of the original issue pretty quickly and not the actual solution for your problem by itself.</p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>Change from method=prefork to method=threaded solved the problem for me.</p>
<br /><b>#10</b><br /><p>Possible solution: <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/django-users/browse_thread/thread/2c7421cdb9b99e48" rel="nofollow">http://groups.google.com/group/django-users/browse_thread/thread/2c7421cdb9b99e48</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Until recently I was curious to test
  this on Django 1.1.1. Will this 
  exception be thrown again... surprise,
  there it was again.  It took me some
  time to debug this, helpful hint was
  that it only  shows when (pre)forking.
  So for those who getting randomly
  those exceptions, I can say... fix 
  your code :)  Ok.. seriously, there
  are always few ways of doing this, so
  let me  firs explain where is a
  problem first.  If you access database
  when any of your modules will import
  as, e.g.  reading configuration from
  database then you will get this error.
  When your fastcgi-prefork application
  starts, first it imports all  modules,
  and only after this forks children. 
  If you have established db connection
  during import all children  processes
  will have an exact copy of that
  object.  This connection is being
  closed at the end of request phase 
  (request_finished signal).  So first
  child which will be called to process
  your request, will  close this
  connection.  But what will happen to
  the rest of the child processes?  They
  will believe that they have open and
  presumably working  connection to the
  db, so any db operation will cause an
  exception.  Why this is not showing in
  threaded execution model? I suppose
  because  threads are using same object
  and know when any other thread is 
  closing connection.  How to fix this? 
  Best way is to fix your code... but
  this can be difficult sometimes. 
  Other option, in my opinion quite
  clean, is to write somewhere in your 
  application small piece of code:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>from django.db import connection 
from django.core import signals 
def close_connection(**kwargs): 
    connection.close() 
signals.request_started.connect(close_connection) 
</code></pre>

<p>Not ideal thought, connecting twice to the DB is a workaround at best.</p>

<hr>

<p>Possible solution: using connection pooling (pgpool, pgbouncer), so you have DB connections pooled and stable, and handed fast to your FCGI daemons.</p>

<p>The problem is that this triggers another bug, psycopg2 raising an <em>InterfaceError</em> because it's trying to disconnect twice (pgbouncer already handled this).</p>

<p>Now the culprit is Django signal *request_finished* triggering <em>connection.close()</em>, and failing loud even if it was already disconnected. I don't think this behavior is desired, as if the request already finished, we don't care about the DB connection anymore. A patch for correcting this should be simple.</p>

<p>Exception handling here could add more leniency:</p>

<p><strong>/usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/Django-1.1.1-py2.6.egg/django/db/_<em>init</em>_.py</strong></p>

<pre><code>   63 # when a Django request is finished.
   64 def close_connection(**kwargs):
   65     connection.close()
   66 signals.request_finished.connect(close_connection)
</code></pre>

<p>Or it could be handled better on psycopg2, so to not throw fatal errors if all we're trying to do is disconnect and it already is:</p>

<p><strong>/usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/Django-1.1.1-py2.6.egg/django/db/backends/_<em>init</em>_.py</strong></p>

<pre><code>   74     def close(self):
   75         if self.connection is not None:
   76             self.connection.close()
   77             self.connection = None
</code></pre>

<p>Other than that, I'm short on ideas.</p>
