<h3>Question (ID-577467):</h3><h2>Pause in Python</h2><p>I am running commandline python scripts from the Windows taskbar by having a shortcut pointing to the python interpreter with the actual script as parameter.</p>

<p>After the script has been processed, the interpreter terminates and the output window is closed which makes it impossible to read script output.</p>

<p>What is the most straightforward way to keep the interpreter window open until any key is pressed?</p>

<p>In batch files, one can end the script with pause. The closest thing to this I found in python is raw_input() which is suboptimal because it requires pressing the return key (instead of any key).</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>One way is to leave a <code>raw_input()</code> at the end so the script waits for you to press Enter before it terminates.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>There's no need to wait for input before closing, just change your command like so:</p>

<pre><code>cmd /K python &lt;script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>/K</code> switch will execute the command that follows, but leave the command interpreter window open, in contrast to <code>/C</code>, which executes and then closes.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>In Windows, you can use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/msvcrt.html#msvcrt-console" rel="nofollow"><code>msvcrt</code></a> module. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>msvcrt.kbhit()</strong>
      Return true if a keypress is waiting to be read.</p>
  
  <p><strong>msvcrt.getch()</strong>
      Read a keypress and return the resulting character. Nothing is echoed
  to the console. This call will block
  if a keypress is not already
  available, but will not wait for Enter
  to be pressed.</p>

<p>If you want it to also work on Unix-like systems you can try <a href="http://pyfaq.infogami.com/how-do-i-get-a-single-keypress-at-a-time" rel="nofollow">this solution</a> using the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/termios.html" rel="nofollow">termios</a> and <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/fcntl.html" rel="nofollow">fcntl</a> modules.</p>

<p>The advantage of using raw_input() instead of msvcrt.* stuff is that the former is a part of standard Python (i.e. absolutely cross-platform). This also means that the script window will be alive after double-clicking on the script file icon, without the need to do </p>

<pre><code>cmd /K python &lt;script&gt;
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Try <code>os.system("pause")</code>I used it and it worked for me :)</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>An external WConio module can help here: <a href="http://newcenturycomputers.net/projects/wconio.html" rel="nofollow">http://newcenturycomputers.net/projects/wconio.html</a></p>

<pre><code>import WConio
WConio.getch()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><pre><code>import pdb
pdb.debug()
</code></pre>

<p>This is used to debug the script. Should be useful to break also.</p>
