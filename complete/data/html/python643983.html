<h3>Question (ID-643983):</h3><h2>What's the best way to replace the ternary operator in Python?</h2><p>If I have some code like:</p>

<pre><code>x = foo ? 1 : 2
</code></pre>

<p>How should I translate it to Python? Can I do this?</p>

<pre><code>if foo:
  x = 1
else:
  x = 2
</code></pre>

<p>Will x still be in scope outside the if / then blocks? Or do I have to do something like this?</p>

<pre><code>x = None
if foo:
  x = 1
else:
  x = 2
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Use the ternary operator(formally <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/expressions.html#boolean-operations" rel="nofollow">conditional expression</a>) in Python 2.5+.</p>

<pre><code>x = 1 if foo else 2
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The Ternary operator <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/643983/whats-the-best-way-to-replace-the-ternary-operator-in-python/644001#644001">mentioned</a> is only available from Python 2.5. From the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary%5Foperation" rel="nofollow">WeekeePeedeea</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Though it had been delayed for several
  years by disagreements over syntax, a
  ternary operator for Python was
  approved as Python Enhancement
  Proposal 308 and was added to the 2.5
  release in September 2006. </p>
  
  <p>Python's ternary operator differs from
  the common ?: operator in the order of
  its operands; the general form is <code>op1
  if condition else op2</code>. This form
  invites considering op1 as the normal
  value and op2 as an exceptional case. </p>
  
  <p>Before 2.5, one could use the ugly
  syntax <code>(lambda x:op2,lambda
  x:op1)[condition]()</code> which also takes
  care of only evaluating expressions
  which are actually needed in order to
  prevent side effects.</p>

<p>I use this (although I'm waiting for somebody to downvote or comment if it is incorrect):</p>

<pre><code>x = foo and 1 or 2
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You could use something like:</p>

<pre><code>val = float(raw_input("Age: "))
status = ("working","retired")[val&gt;65]
print "You should be",status
</code></pre>

<p>though it is not very <em>pythonic</em></p>

<p>(the other options are closer to C/PERL, but this involves more tuple magic)</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I'm still using 2.4 in one of my projects and have come across this a few times.  The most elegant solution I've see for this is:</p>

<pre><code>x = {True: 1, False: 2}[foo is not None]
</code></pre>

<p>I like this because it represents a more clear boolean test than using a list with the index values 0 and 1 to get your return value.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>A nice python trick is using this:</p>

<pre><code>foo = ["ifFalse","ifTrue"][booleanCondition]
</code></pre>

<p>It creates a 2 membered list, and the boolean becomes either 0 (false) or 1 (true), which picks the correct member.
Not very readable, but pythony :)</p>
