<h3>Question (ID-481692):</h3><h2>Can a lambda function call itself recursively in Python?</h2><p>A regular function can contain a call to itself in its definition, no problem.  I can't figure out how to do it with a lambda function though for the simple reason that the lambda function has no name to refer back to.  Is there a way to do it?  How?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The only way I can think of to do this amounts to giving the function a name:</p>

<pre><code>fact = lambda x: 1 if x == 0 else x * fact(x-1)
</code></pre>

<p>or alternately, for earlier versions of python:</p>

<pre><code>fact = lambda x: x == 0 and 1 or x * fact(x-1)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: using the ideas from the other answers, I was able to wedge the factorial function into a single unnamed lambda:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; map(lambda n: (lambda f, *a: f(f, *a))(lambda rec, n: 1 if n == 0 else n*rec(rec, n-1), n), range(10))
[1, 1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720, 5040, 40320, 362880]
</code></pre>

<p>So it's possible, but not really recommended!</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You can't directly do it, because it has no name. But with a helper function like the Y-combinator Lemmy pointed to, you can create recursion by passing the function as a parameter to itself (as strange as that sounds):</p>

<pre><code># helper function
def recursive(f, *p, **kw):
   return f(f, *p, **kw)

def fib(n):
   # The rec parameter will be the lambda function itself
   return recursive((lambda rec, n: rec(rec, n-1) + rec(rec, n-2) if n&gt;1 else 1), n)

# using map since we already started to do black functional programming magic
print map(fib, range(10))
</code></pre>

<p>This prints the first ten Fibonacci numbers: <code>[1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]</code>, </p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I have never used Python, but <a href="http://siddhi.blogspot.com/2007/08/y-combinator-in-python.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> is probably what you are looking for.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Yes. I have two ways to do it, and one was already covered. This is my preferred way.</p>

<pre><code>(lambda v: (lambda n: n * __import__('types').FunctionType(
        __import__('inspect').stack()[0][0].f_code, 
        dict(__import__=__import__, dict=dict)
    )(n - 1) if n &gt; 1 else 1)(v))(5)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>If you were truly masochistic, you might be able to do it using C extensions, but to echo Greg (hi Greg!), this exceeds the capability of a lambda (unnamed, anonymous) functon.</p>

<p>No.  (for most values of no).</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>without reduce, map, named lambdas or python internals:</p>

<pre><code>(lambda a:lambda v:a(a,v))(lambda s,x:1 if x==0 else x*s(s,x-1))(10)
</code></pre>
