<h3>Question (ID-8622493):</h3><h2>Using python, how can I merge or join two lists so that their values don't overlap?</h2><p>First off, I apologize for my inaccurate vocabulary. I am an absolute ground-zero beginner. Anyways, I am attempting to solve this problem: 
<a href="http://projecteuler.net/problem=1" rel="nofollow">http://projecteuler.net/problem=1</a></p>

<p>To be brief, I'm trying to write a script that will find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.</p>

<p>My (extremely basic) approach was with this program:</p>

<pre><code>##Multiples of 3
x = range(3, 1000, 3)

##Multiples of 5
y = range(5, 1000, 5)

a = sum(x)
b = sum(y)
n = a + b

print n
</code></pre>

<p>I realized that this was wrong because there are numbers like 15 that are included twice (it's a multiple of both 5 and 3).
So is there a way to fix this or am I approaching this problem from a completely wrong angle?
Or do I need to just study more before I try solving this problem?
I also apologize if this has been explained in a previous post, but I looked around for a bit. </p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You can use a <code>set</code> to eliminate the duplicates:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; len(x)
333
&gt;&gt;&gt; len(y)
199
&gt;&gt;&gt; s = set(x + y)
&gt;&gt;&gt; len(s)
532
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can <code>sum</code> the members of the set instead.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>It is called inclusion exclusion principle so you can do like</p>

<pre><code>##Multiples of 3
x = range(3, 1000, 3)

##Multiples of 5
y = range(5, 1000, 5)

##multiple of 15 are counted twice
z=range(15,1000,15)


a = sum(x)
b = sum(y)
c = sum(z)
n = a + b -c
print(n)
</code></pre>

<p>but beauty is in using generators or list comprehensions</p>

<pre><code>a = sum(i for i in range(1000) if i%3 == 0 or i%5 == 0 )
print(a)
</code></pre>

<p>Where % is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation" rel="nofollow">modulo</a> and is remainder in integer devision.
Nice thing about this is that codes reads so fluently and is direct translation of rules and can be read from left to right.</p>

<p>Both algorithms run times depends on n in this case is 1000. If n would be for instance 1000000000 you would have to wait for long time to complete. If you apply little mathematics you can find out that </p>

<pre><code>sum(a for a in range(a1,a2,n)) 
</code></pre>

<p>is actually <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression" rel="nofollow">arithmetic progression</a> and total of this can be calculated in constant time no matter how big n is.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Euler#Example_problem_and_solutions" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Euler#Example_problem_and_solutions</a></p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Simple method:</p>

<p><code>sum(set(x+y))</code></p>

<p><a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#set" rel="nofollow"><code>set</code>s</a> have a fair bit of functionality you'll find useful for the PE problems. </p>

<p>You could also do it with a simple loop over the entire range pretty easily. </p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You're looking for <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#set" rel="nofollow">sets</a>.</p>

<pre><code>##Multiples of 3
x = range(3, 1000, 3)

##Multiples of 5
y = range(5, 1000, 5)

x = list(set(x) - set(y))
</code></pre>

<p>Depending on what you're doing, you'll have to change the code.  The above removes everything in <code>y</code> from <code>x</code>.  It's like lists but you can do arithmetic on the items.  </p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>To merge sorted sequences you could use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/heapq.html#heapq.merge" rel="nofollow"><code>heapq.merge</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>import heapq
print list(heapq.merge(xrange(3, 20, 3), xrange(5, 20, 5)))
# -&gt; [3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 15, 18]
</code></pre>

<p>To remove duplicate items you could use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/itertools#recipes" rel="nofollow"><code>unique_justseen</code> recipe from itertools documentation</a>:</p>

<pre><code>print list(unique_justseen([3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 15, 18]))
# -&gt; [3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18]
</code></pre>

<p>In this case <code>unique_justseen()</code> could be simplified to:</p>

<pre><code>from itertools import groupby, imap
from operator  import itemgetter

def unique_justseen(iterable):
    return imap(itemgetter(0), groupby(iterable))
</code></pre>

<p>These functions don't require input arguments to be sequences. They accept arbitrary iterables (including infinite) e.g., to generate an infinite sequence of multiples of 3 or 5:</p>

<pre><code>import heapq
from itertools import count, takewhile

m3, m5 = count(3, 3), count(5, 5) 
m3_5 = heapq.merge(m3, m5)
uniq_m3_5 = unique_justseen(m3_5) # *all* unique multiples of 3 or 5
</code></pre>

<p>To find the solution:</p>

<pre><code>print sum(takewhile(lambda x: x &lt; 1000, uniq_m3_5))
# -&gt; 233168
# check that it is correct
print sum(set(range(3, 1000, 3) + range(5, 1000, 5)))
# -&gt; 233168
print sum(x for x in xrange(1000) if x % 3 == 0 or x % 5 == 0)
# -&gt; 233168
print sumk(3, 1000) + sumk(5, 1000) - sumk(15, 1000)
# -&gt; 233168
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>sumk()</code> is:</p>

<pre><code>def sumk(k, n):
    m = (n-1)//k
    return k*m*(m+1)//2
</code></pre>

<p>The formula is from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Euler#Example_problem_and_solutions" rel="nofollow">the Wikipedia link</a> provided by <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/8622594/4279">@ralu</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I don't know if this is less effecient, but making two sets and doing boolean operations on both to remove duplicates seems redundant since the definition of a set is </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset" rel="nofollow">an unordered collection of <strong><em>distinct</em></strong> hashable objects</a><br>
  (emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>so just add both ranges to one set and let "creating" the set remove the dupes:</p>

<pre><code>sum(set(range(3, 1000, 3) + range(5, 1000, 5)))
</code></pre>
