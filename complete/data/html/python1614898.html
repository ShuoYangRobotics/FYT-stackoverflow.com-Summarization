<h3>Question (ID-1614898):</h3><h2>Running Python from the Windows Command Line</h2><p>How do I run a Python file from the Windows Command Line (<code>cmd.exe</code>) so that I won't have to re-enter the code each time?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Wouldn't you simply save your Python code into a file, and then execute that file using Python?</p>

<p>Save your code into a file called <code>Test.py</code>.</p>

<p>And then run it?</p>

<pre><code>$ C:\Python24\Python.exe C:\Temp\Test.py
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>If you don't want to install an IDE, you can also use IDLE which includes a Python editor and a console to test things out, this is part of the standard installation.</p>

<p>If you installed the python.org version, you will see an <code>IDLE (Python GUI)</code> in your start menu. I would recommend adding it to your Quick Launch or your desktop - whatever you are most familiar with. Then right-click on the shortcut you have created and change the "Start in" directory to your project directory or a place you can mess with, not the installation directory which is the default place and probably a bad idea.</p>

<p>When you double-click the shortcut it will launch IDLE, a console in which you can type in Python command and have history, completion, colours and so on. You can also start an editor to create a program file (like mentioned in the other posts). There is even a debugger.</p>

<p>If you saved your application in "test.py", you can start it from the editor itself. Or from the console with <code>execfile("test.py")</code>, <code>import test</code> (if that is a module), or finally from the debugger.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If you put the Python executable (python.exe) on your path, you can invoke your script using <code>python script.py</code> where script.py is the Python file that you want to execute.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>A good tool to have is the <a href="http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/Documentation" rel="nofollow">IPython shell</a>.  Not only can it run your program (%run command), but it offers also many tools for using Python interactively in an efficient manner (automatic completion, syntax coloring, quick access to the documentation, good interaction with Matplotlib,â€¦).  After you install it, you'll have access to its shell in the Start menu.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Open a command prompt, by pressing <code>Win+R</code> and writing <code>cmd</code> in that , navigate to the script directory , and write : <code>python script.py</code></p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>In DOS you can use <code>edit</code> to create/modify text files, then execute them by typing <code>python [yourfile]</code></p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>You need to create environment variables. Follow the instructions here: <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/articles/command_line.shtml#environment-variables" rel="nofollow">http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/articles/command_line.shtml#environment-variables</a></p>
