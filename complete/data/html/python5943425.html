<h3>Question (ID-5943425):</h3><h2>Is there a dataset in python similar to structs in C++?</h2><p>Is there a dataset in python similar to structs in C++? I like the struct feature <code>myStruct.someName</code>. I know, that classes have this, but I don't want to write a class everytime I need a "container" for some data. =)</p>

<p>If you want to save some memory, you might also want to use <code>__slots__</code> so the objects don't have a <code>__dict__</code>. See <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html#slots" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html#slots</a> for details and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/472000/python-slots">Python __slots__</a> for some useful information.</p>

<p>For example, a class holding only two values (<code>a</code> and <code>b</code>) could looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>class AB(object):
    __slots__ = ('a', 'b')
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>If you actually want a dict but with <code>obj.item</code> access instead of <code>obj['item']</code>, you could subclass dict and implement <code>__getattr__</code> and <code>__setattr__</code> to behave like <code>__getitem__</code> and <code>__setitem__</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Please realise that in C++, the only difference between a class and a struct is that the elements of a class are by default private, as is the inheritance. The following are equivalent:</p>

<pre><code>class D : public B {
    public:
    ...
}; 

struct D {
    ...
};
</code></pre>

<p>In Python, it would make most sense to use a class if you want to use the dot operator to access elements.  In fact, it's even easier, as you only have to initialise the members you currently want, and can add/remove members later. Therefore, the following would work:</p>

<pre><code>class D(object):
    pass
</code></pre>

<p>You can then add as many members as you want simply by assigning to them.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>In addition to the dict type, there is a <a href="http://docs.python.org/dev/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple" rel="nofollow">namedtuple</a> type that behaves somewhat like a struct.</p>

<pre><code>MyStruct = namedtuple('MyStruct', ['someName', 'anotherName'])
aStruct = MyStruct('aValue', 'anotherValue')

print aStruct.someName, aStruct.anotherName
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I believe you're looking for a <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#dict" rel="nofollow"><code>dict</code></a>.</p>

<pre><code>d = dict({
        'name': 'myname',
        'val': 'myval'
        })

print d
print d['name']
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Try using a <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#dict" rel="nofollow"><code>dict</code></a>.</p>

<p>Here's a simplistic demonstration.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; something = {}
&gt;&gt;&gt; something['x'] = 42
&gt;&gt;&gt; something['y'] = 'cheese'
&gt;&gt;&gt; something
{'y': 'cheese', 'x': 42}
&gt;&gt;&gt; something['x']
42
&gt;&gt;&gt; something['y']
'cheese'
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You can always go for the dynamic approach:</p>

<pre><code>class foo(object):
    def __init__(self,**kwargs):
        self.__dict__.update(kwargs)
</code></pre>

<p>This'll make a class with the same methods that you pass in as a dict:</p>

<pre><code>bar = foo(bill="yo",heather="hi",sam="piss off")
</code></pre>

<p>leaving you with the following perfectly valid calls on <code>bar</code>:</p>

<pre><code>bar.bill
&gt;&gt; "yo"
bar.heater
&gt;&gt; "hi"
</code></pre>

<p>you get the idea...</p>
