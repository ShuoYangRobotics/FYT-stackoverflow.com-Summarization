<h3>Question (ID-743248):</h3><h2>Something wrong with output from list in Python</h2><p>I want a Python program to import a list of words from a text file and print out the content of the text file as two lists. The data in the text file is on this form: </p>

<pre><code>A Alfa
B Betta
C Charlie
</code></pre>

<p>I want a Python program to print out one list with A,B,C and one with Alfa, Betta, Charlie.</p>

<p>This is what I've written:</p>

<pre><code>english2german = open('english2german.txt', 'r')
englist = []
gerlist = []

for i, line in enumerate(english2german):
    englist[i:], gerlist[i:] = line.split()
</code></pre>

<p>This is making two lists, but will only print out the first letter in each word.
How can I make my code to print out the whole word?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You want something like this:</p>

<pre><code>english2german = open("english2german.txt")
englist = []
gerlist = []

for line in english2german:
    (e, g) = line.split()
    englist.append(e)
    gerlist.append(g)
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with your code before is that <code>englist[i:]</code> is actually a <em>slice</em> of a list, not just a single index. A string is also iterable, so you were basically stuffing a single letter into several indices. In other words, something like <code>gerlist[0:] = "alfa"</code> actually results in <code>gerlist = ['a', 'l', 'f', 'a']</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>And even shorter than <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/743248/something-wrong-with-output-from-list-in-python/743274#743274">amo-ej1's answer</a>, and likely faster:</p>

<pre><code>In [1]: english2german = open('english2german.txt')
In [2]: eng, ger = zip(*( line.split() for line in english2german ))
In [3]: eng
Out[3]: ('A', 'B', 'C')
In [4]: ger
Out[4]: ('Alfa', 'Betta', 'Charlie')
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using Python 3.0 or <code>from future_builtins import zip</code>, this is memory-efficient too.  Otherwise replace <code>zip</code> with <code>izip</code> from <code>itertools</code> if <code>english2german</code> is very long.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>just an addition: you're working with files.
please close them :) or use the with construct:</p>

<pre><code>with open('english2german.txt') as english2german:
  englist, gerlist = zip(*(line.split() for line in english2german))
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Like this you mean:</p>

<pre><code>english2german = open('k.txt', 'r')
englist = []
gerlist = []

for i, line in enumerate(english2german):
    englist.append(line.split()[0])
    gerlist.append(line.split()[1])

print englist
print gerlist
</code></pre>

<p>which generates:</p>

<p>['A', 'B', 'C']
['Alfa', 'Betta', 'Charlie']</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>The solutions already posted are OK if you have no spaces in any of the words (ie each line has a single space). If I understand correctly, you are trying to build a dictionary, so I would suggest you consider the fact that you can also have definitions of multiple word expressions. In that case, you'd better use some other character instead of a space to separate the definition from the word. Something like "|", which is impossible to appear in a word.</p>

<p>Then, you do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>for line in english2german:
    (e, g) = line.split("|")
    englist.append(e)
    gerlist.append(g)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Slightly meta-answer(?) to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/743248/something-wrong-with-output-from-list-in-python/743313#743313">Autoplectic's</a> suggestion of using <code>zip()</code></p>

<p>With 3 lines in the input file (from the supplied data in the question):</p>

<p>The <code>zip()</code> method takes an average of <code>0.404729390144</code> seconds, compared to <code>0.341339087486</code> with the simple for loop constructing two lists (the code from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/743248/something-wrong-with-output-from-list-in-python/743268#743268">mipadi's</a> currently accepted answer).</p>

<p>With 10,000 lines in the input file (random generated 3-12 character words. I reduced the <code>timeit.repeat()</code> values to 100 times, repeated twice):</p>

<p><code>zip()</code> took an average of <code>1.43965339661</code> seconds, compared to <code>1.52318406105</code> with the for loop.</p>

<p>Both benchmarks were done using Python version 2.5.1</p>

<p>Hardly a huge difference.. Given how much more readable the simple for loop is, I would recommend using it.. The <code>zip</code> code might be a bit quicker with large files, but the difference is about 0.083 seconds with 10,000 lines..</p>

<p>Benchmarking code:</p>

<pre><code>import timeit

# http://stackoverflow.com/questions/743248/something-wrong-with-output-from-list-in-python/743313#743313
code_zip = """english2german = open('english2german.txt')
eng, ger = zip(*( line.split() for line in english2german ))
"""

# http://stackoverflow.com/questions/743248/something-wrong-with-output-from-list-in-python/743268#743268
code_for = """english2german = open("english2german.txt")
englist = []
gerlist = []

for line in english2german:
    (e, g) = line.split()
    englist.append(e)
    gerlist.append(g)
"""

for code in [code_zip, code_for]:
    t = timeit.Timer(stmt = code)
    try:
        times = t.repeat(10, 10000)
    except:
        t.print_exc()
    else:
        print "Code:"
        print code
        print "Time:"
        print times
        print "Average:"
        print sum(times) / len(times)
        print "-" * 20
