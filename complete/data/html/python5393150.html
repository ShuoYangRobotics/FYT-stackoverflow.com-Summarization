<h3>Question (ID-5393150):</h3><h2>How do I obtain values(lines) from file2 using only indices in file1?</h2><p>I have one file1 with only indices, and second file2 contains the values of these indices of file1. How do I obtain these values from file2 using the indices in file1, and output its value to a third file.For simplicity sake, every index in file1 has its associated values in file2. </p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>file1:</p>

<pre><code>2
3
4
</code></pre>

<p>file2 contents:</p>

<pre><code>0.24  0.43             
0.34  0.28              
7.50  0.67               
0.23  0.78               
0.45  0.49              
</code></pre>

<p>Expected result</p>

<pre><code>7.50 0.67
0.23 0.78
0.45 0.49
</code></pre>

<p>file1 #contains only indices
file2 #every index in file1 contains values with associated indices</p>

<pre><code>fname = file1.readlines()
fname2 = file2.readlines()
outfile = open('Values.txt','w')

for index in fname:
  for line in fname2:
    if line == index:
      outfile.writelines(line)

print "all indices' values have been written to a file success

<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>These solutions do not rely on file1 being ordered, however they do load file2 into memory, which could be costly if file2 is large. you will notice however that wanted_lines and lines_out are generators in the first example, which should save a small amount of memory. </p>

<p>This example has no error handling, but is basically what you need. I'll knock together a better one in a sec.</p>

<pre><code>wanted_lines = (int(line) for line in open(file1).readlines())
all_lines = [line.strip() for line in open(file1).readlines()]
lines_out = (all_lines[index] for index in wanted_lines)
open(file3, 'w').writelines(lines_out)
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Better:</p>

<pre><code>all_lines = [line.strip() for line in open(file2).readlines()]
lines_out = []
for line in open(file1).readlines():
  try:
    index = int(line)
    lines_out.append(all_lines[index] + '\n')
  except IndexError:
    print file1, "is only", len(file1), "lines long, therefore has no", index+1, "th line."
  except:
    print "could not coerce", line.strip(), "to an int"
open(file3, 'w').writelines(lines_out)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><pre><code>fname = file1.readlines()
fname = [ int(i) for i in fname]
f = open("file2")
for number,line in enumerate(f):
    if number in fname :
         print line.rstrip()
f.close()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><pre><code>def copyLines(infname, outfname, lines, firstLine=0):
    lines = list(set(lines))   # remove duplicates
    lines.sort(reverse=True)   # sort in descending order
    with open(infname, 'r') as inf, open(outfname, 'w') as outf:
        try:
            i = firstLine
            while lines:
                seek = lines.pop()
                while i&lt;seek:
                    inf.next()
                    i += 1
                outf.write(inf.next())
                i += 1
        except StopIteration:  # hit end of file
            pass

def main():
    with open('file1') as inf:
        linesToRead = [int(ln) for ln in inf]

    copyLines('file2', 'Values.txt', linesToRead)

<p>Note that this will quit early if all desired lines have been found (ie if you only want lines 3-9 of a 1000-line file, it will only read to line 9).</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>If you only want to do that, you can use a oneliner bash</p>

<pre><code>join file1 &lt;(grep -v '^$' file2 | cat -n ) | cut -d ' ' -f 2- &gt; Values.txt
</code></pre>

<p>but here, indices starts at 1 instead of 0. To start at 0: </p>

<pre><code>join &lt;(awk '{print $1+1}' &lt; file1)  &lt;(grep -v '^$' file2 | cat -n) | cut -d ' ' -f 2- &gt; Values.txt
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>If file2's lines don't have to be written in the order they appear in file1, and if file1's contents are small enough to fit in RAM, this should do it efficiently:</p>

<pre><code>outfile = open('Values.txt','w')
desired = set(int(line) for line in open('file1').readlines())
for index, line in enumerate(open('file2')):
    if index in desired:
        outfile.write(line)
</code></pre>

<p>This differs from kurumi's answer mainly in that it uses a set to hold the line numbers from file1 (O(1) instead of O(n) for checking whether to emit a line), and it uses file.write so no whitespace is altered from the original lines in file2.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>This version does not assume that indices in file1 are sorted.</p>

<pre><code>indices = [int(x) for x in file("file1").readlines()]
data = file("file2").readlines()

for i in indices:
    print data[i]
</code></pre>
