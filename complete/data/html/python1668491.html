<h3>Question (ID-1668491):</h3><h2>Summing Consecutive Ranges Pythonically</h2><p>I have a sumranges() function, which sums all the ranges of consecutive numbers found in a tuple of tuples. To illustrate:</p>

<pre><code>def sumranges(nums):
    return sum([sum([1 for j in range(len(nums[i])) if
                     nums[i][j] == 0 or
                     nums[i][j - 1] + 1 != nums[i][j]]) for
                i in range(len(nums))])

&gt;&gt;&gt; nums = ((1, 2, 3, 4), (1, 5, 6), (19, 20, 24, 29, 400))
&gt;&gt;&gt; print sumranges(nums)
7
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, it returns the number of ranges of consecutive digits within the tuple, that is: len((1, 2, 3, 4), (1), (5, 6), (19, 20), (24), (29), (400)) = 7. The tuples are always ordered.</p>

<p>My problem is that my sumranges() is terrible. I hate looking at it. I'm currently just iterating through the tuple and each subtuple, assigning a 1 if the number is not (1 + previous number), and summing the total. I feel like I am missing a much easier way to accomplish my stated objective. Does anyone know a more pythonic way to do this?</p>

<p>Edit: I have benchmarked all the answers given thus far. Thanks to all of you for your answers.</p>

<p>The benchmarking code is as follows, using a sample size of 100K:</p>

<pre><code>from time import time
from random import randrange
nums = [sorted(list(set(randrange(1, 10) for i in range(10)))) for
        j in range(100000)]

for func in sumranges, alex, matt, redglyph, ephemient, ferdinand:
    start = time()
    result = func(nums)
    end = time()
    print ', '.join([func.__name__, str(result), str(end - start) + ' s'])
</code></pre>

<p>Results are as follows. Actual answer shown to verify that all functions return the correct answer:</p>

<pre><code>sumranges, 250281, 0.54171204567 s
alex, 250281, 0.531121015549 s
matt, 250281, 0.843333005905 s
redglyph, 250281, 0.366822004318 s
ephemient, 250281, 0.805964946747 s
ferdinand, 250281, 0.405596971512 s
</code></pre>

<p>RedGlyph does edge out in terms of speed, but the simplest answer is probably Ferdinand's, and probably wins for most pythonic.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>My 2 cents:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; sum(len(set(x - i for i, x in enumerate(t))) for t in nums)
7
</code></pre>

<p>It's basically the same idea as descriped in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1668491#answer-1668616">Alex' post</a>, but using a <code>set</code> instead of <code>itertools.groupby</code>, resulting in a shorter expression. Since <code>set</code>s are implemented in C and <code>len()</code> of a set runs in constant time, this should also be pretty fast.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Consider:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; nums = ((1, 2, 3, 4), (1, 5, 6), (19, 20, 24, 29, 400))
&gt;&gt;&gt; flat = [[(x - i) for i, x in enumerate(tu)] for tu in nums]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print flat
[[1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 4, 4], [19, 19, 22, 26, 396]]
&gt;&gt;&gt; import itertools
&gt;&gt;&gt; print sum(1 for tu in flat for _ in itertools.groupby(tu))
7
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>we "flatten" the "increasing ramps" of interest by subtracting the index from the value, turning them into consecutive "runs" of identical values; then we identify and could the "runs" with the precious <code>itertools.groupby</code>.  This seems to be a pretty elegant (and speedy) solution to your problem.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Just to show something closer to your original code:</p>

<pre><code>def sumranges(nums):
    return sum( (1 for i in nums
                   for j, v in enumerate(i)
                   if j == 0 or v != i[j-1] + 1) )
</code></pre>

<p>The idea here was to:</p>

<ul>
<li>avoid building intermediate lists but use a generator instead, it will save some resources</li>
<li>avoid using indices when you already have selected a subelement (i and v above).</li>
</ul>

<p>The remaining <code>sum()</code> is still necessary with my example though.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Here's my attempt:</p>

<pre><code>def ranges(ls):
    for l in ls:
        consec = False
        for (a,b) in zip(l, l[1:]+(None,)):
            if b == a+1:
                consec = True
            if b is not None and b != a+1:
                consec = False
            if consec:
                yield 1

'''
&gt;&gt;&gt; nums = ((1, 2, 3, 4), (1, 5, 6), (19, 20, 24, 29, 400))
&gt;&gt;&gt; print sum(ranges(nums))
7
'''
</code></pre>

<p>It looks at the numbers pairwise, checking if they are a consecutive pair (unless it's at the last element of the list). Each time there's a consecutive pair of numbers it yields 1.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>This could probably be put together in a more compact form, but I think clarity would suffer:</p>

<pre><code>def pairs(seq):
    for i in range(1,len(seq)):
        yield (seq[i-1], seq[i])

def isadjacent(pair):
    return pair[0]+1 == pair[1]

def sumrange(seq):
    return 1 + sum([1 for pair in pairs(seq) if not isadjacent(pair)])

def sumranges(nums):
    return sum([sumrange(seq) for seq in nums])


nums = ((1, 2, 3, 4), (1, 5, 6), (19, 20, 24, 29, 400))
print sumranges(nums)   # prints 7
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You could probably do this better if you had an <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/interval/1.0.0" rel="nofollow">IntervalSet class</a> because then you would scan through your ranges to build your IntervalSet, then just use the count of set members.</p>

<p>Some tasks don't always lend themselves to neat code, particularly if you need to write the code for performance.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>There is a formula for this, the sum of the first n numbers,  1+ 2+ ... + n = n(n+1) / 2 . Then if you want to have the sum of i-j then it is (j(j+1)/2) - (i(i+1)/2) this I am sure simplifies but you can work that out. It might not be pythonic but it is what I would use.</p>
