<h3>Question (ID-2580497):</h3><h2>Database on the fly with scripting languages</h2><p>I have a set of .csv files that I want to process. It would be far easier to process it with SQL queries. I wonder if there is some way to load a .csv file and use SQL language to look into it with a scripting language like python or ruby. Loading it with something similar to ActiveRecord would be awesome. </p>

<p>The problem is that I don't want to have to run a database somewhere prior to running my script. I souldn't have additionnal installations needed outside of the scripting language and some modules.</p>

<p>My question is which language and what modules should I use for this task. I looked around and can't find anything that suits my need. Is it even possible?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>There's <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/sqlite3" rel="nofollow"><code>sqlite3</code></a>, included into python. With it you can create a database (<strong>on memory</strong>) and add rows to it, and perform SQL queries.</p>

<p>If you want neat ActiveRecord-like functionality you should add an external ORM, like <a href="http://sqlalchemy.org" rel="nofollow">sqlalchemy</a>. That's a separate download though</p>

<p>Quick example using sqlalchemy:</p>

<pre><code>from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, String, Integer, MetaData, Table
from sqlalchemy.orm import mapper, create_session
import csv
CSV_FILE = 'foo.csv'
engine = create_engine('sqlite://') # memory-only database

table = None
metadata = MetaData(bind=engine)
with open(CSV_FILE) as f:
    # assume first line is header
    cf = csv.DictReader(f, delimiter=',')
    for row in cf:
        if table is None:
            # create the table
            table = Table('foo', metadata, 
                Column('id', Integer, primary_key=True),
                *(Column(rowname, String()) for rowname in row.keys()))
            table.create()
        # insert data into the table
        table.insert().values(**row).execute()

class CsvTable(object): pass
mapper(CsvTable, table)
session = create_session(bind=engine, autocommit=False, autoflush=True)
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can query the database, filtering by any field, etc.</p>

<p>Suppose you run the code above on this csv:</p>

<pre><code>name,age,nickname
nosklo,32,nosklo
Afila Tun,32,afilatun
Foo Bar,33,baz
</code></pre>

<p>That will create and populate a table in memory with fields <code>name</code>, <code>age</code>, <code>nickname</code>. You can then query the table:</p>

<pre><code>for r in session.query(CsvTable).filter(CsvTable.age == '32'):
    print r.name, r.age, r.nickname
</code></pre>

<p>That will automatically create and run a <code>SELECT</code> query and return the correct rows.</p>

<p>Another advantage of using sqlalchemy is that, if you decide to use another, more powerful database in the future, you can do so pratically without changing the code.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Use a DB in a library like <a href="http://sqlite.org/" rel="nofollow">SQLite</a>. 
There are <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/sqlite3.html" rel="nofollow">Python</a> and <a href="http://sqlite-ruby.rubyforge.org/" rel="nofollow">Ruby</a> versions .</p>

<p>Load your CSV into table, there might be modules/libraries to help you here too. Then SQL away.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Looked at Perl and and Text::CSV and DBI? There are many modules on CPAN to do exactly this. Here is an example (from <a href="http://perlmeme.org/tutorials/parsing_csv.html" rel="nofollow">HERE</a>):</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use DBI;

# Connect to the database, (the directory containing our csv file(s))

my $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect("DBI:CSV:f_dir=.;csv_eol=\n;");

# Associate our csv file with the table name 'prospects'

$dbh-&gt;{'csv_tables'}-&gt;{'prospects'} = { 'file' =&gt; 'prospects.csv'};

# Output the name and contact field from each row

my $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare("SELECT * FROM prospects WHERE name LIKE 'G%'");
$sth-&gt;execute();
while (my $row = $sth-&gt;fetchrow_hashref) {
     print("name = ", $row-&gt;{'Name'}, "  contact = ", $row-&gt;{'Contact'}. "\n");
}
$sth-&gt;finish();

name = Glenhuntly Pharmacy  contact = Paul
name = Gilmour's Shoes  contact = Ringo
</code></pre>

<p>Just type perldoc DBI   and perldoc Text::CSV at the command prompt for more.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>CSV files are not databases--they have no indices--and any SQL simulation you imposed upon them would amount to little more than searching through the entire thing over and over again. </p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You could use either scripting language to parse the CSV file and store the data into <a href="http://sqlite.org/" rel="nofollow">SQLite</a>, which just uses a single file for storage. From there you have it in a database and can run queries against it.</p>

<p>Alternatively, on windows you can setup an ODBC data source as a CSV file. But it may be difficult to automate this.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>PHP FlatfileDB available <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/flatfiledb/" rel="nofollow">here</a> is a very good option if you are building a web app</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I used nosklo's solution (thanks!) but I already had a primary key (passed in as pk_col) within the column line (first line of csv). So I thought I'd share my modification. I used a ternary. </p>

<pre><code>table = Table(tablename, metadata,
    *((Column(pk_col, Integer, primary_key=True)) if rowname == pk_col else (Column(rowname, String())) for rowname in row.keys()))
table.create()
</code></pre>
