<h3>Question (ID-2901847):</h3><h2>Integer array in Python</h2><p>How I can define array of integer numbers in Python code</p>

<p>Say if this code is ok. or no</p>

<pre><code>pos = [int]

len = 99

for i in range (0,99):
    pos[i]=7
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Why not just:</p>

<pre><code>pos = [7] * 99
</code></pre>

<p>This is the most pythonic, in my opinion.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><pre><code>import array

pos = array.array('l', 7 * [99])
</code></pre>

<p>The <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/array.html?highlight=array#module-array" rel="nofollow">array</a> module of Python's standard library is the only way to make an <em>array</em> that comes with Python (the third-party module <code>numpy</code> offers other ways, but needs do be downloaded and installed separately) -- what your Q is doing, as well as every answer so far, is building a <code>list</code>, <strong>not</strong> an <code>array</code>.</p>

<p>In particular, there is no constraint that the <code>pos</code> list built in your Q and the several As contains just integers -- while, with the snippet I give, you <em>do</em> get that constraint (32-bit signed integers in this case, to be precise), which rigidly limits you but also saves a bunch of memory (an array of integers should take about one fifth the amount of memory that a list filled with integers will take, unless there's a lot of perennial duplication in the lists' items).</p>

<p>BTW, if you say <code>array</code> when you mean <code>list</code> (just in case <code>list</code> <em>is</em> what you meant), you're sure to cause a lot of confusion -- saying what you mean, and meaning what you say, helps a <em>lot</em> in clear communication, unsurprisingly!-)</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>you do not declare the type of variables in python, so no <code>pos=[int]</code>
all you have to do:</p>

<pre><code>pos=[]
for i in range(99):
    pos.append(7)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You can simply do</p>

<pre><code>pos = [7] * 99
print pos #will print the whole array [7, 7, .... 7]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>If you just want to declare the array, all you have to do in python is:</p>

<pre><code>pos = []
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to fill the array with 99 7's:</p>

<pre><code>pos = [7] * 99
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to fill the array based on a pattern:</p>

<pre><code>pos = [i for i in range(99)]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>One way is:</p>

<pre><code>pos = [7 for _ in xrange(0,99)]
</code></pre>

<p>in Python 2 or:</p>

<pre><code>pos = [7 for _ in range(0,99)]
</code></pre>

<p>in Python 3.  These are <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow">list comprehensions</a>, and are easy to extend for more complex work.</p>

<p>Also:</p>

<pre><code>pos = [int]
</code></pre>

<p>doesn't make much sense.  You're creating a list with the only element being the type int.</p>
