<h3>Question (ID-2775049):</h3><h2>Good looking programs that are built using wxPython for their UI</h2><p>I need inspiration and motivation so I'm trying to find examples of different programs that have interesting and attractive UI's created free using wxPython. </p>

<p>My searches have been slow to find results.  I'm hoping you guys know of some of the best ones out there.</p>

<p>btw, I've seen these:
<a href="http://www.wxpython.org/screenshots.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.wxpython.org/screenshots.php</a></p>

<p>and the list under "Applications Developed with wxPython" on the wxPython Wikipedia page.</p>

<p>Update: only need Windows examples</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-10):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p><strong>The wxPython Demo</strong>
Some nice guis can be found in the <a href="http://www.wxpython.org/download.php" rel="nofollow">wxpython demo</a>. Actually the demo is a GUI ;-)</p>

<p><strong>GUI2Exe</strong>
Another interesting example is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gui2exe/" rel="nofollow">GUI2exe</a> from Andrea Gavana an expert on wxpython and a prolific widget creator.</p>

<p><strong>SPE</strong>
And finally, my recommendation is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stani%27s_Python_Editor" rel="nofollow">Stanis python editor (SPE)</a>. Here you will find all kind of stuff (interpreter shell embedded, third party applications neatly integrated in the main program, code editor, and more...) everything running on wxpython.  SPE is just about good design both in terms of code and of usability. It runs in windows and linux. Stani is also the author of Phatch another application based on wxpython mentioned in one of the comments as a good example of design. These and <a href="http://pythonide.blogspot.com/2008/10/how-to-make-money-with-free-software.html" rel="nofollow">other facts</a> about this guy are not coincidences... </p>

<p><strong>DABO</strong>
I forgot to mention <a href="http://dabodev.com/" rel="nofollow">Dabo</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dabo is a 3-tier, cross-platform
  application development framework,
  written in Python atop the wxPython
  GUI toolkit. And while Dabo is
  designed to create database-centric
  apps, that is not a requirement. Lots
  of people are using Dabo for the GUI
  tools to create apps that have no need
  to connect to a database at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dabo has a demo GUI build-in that allows to create/access your database and manage the data. </p>

<p><strong>Editra</strong>
Ooops I forgot also <a href="http://editra.org/" rel="nofollow">editra</a> a multilanguaje editor/IDE (still I prefer SPE although SPE is python specific). One interesting feature is that Editra can be extended with plugins.</p>

<p>I use all this programs myself in windowsXP.</p>

<p><strong>Later Edit</strong>: two more applications using wxpython:</p>

<p><strong>PyChem</strong>
Another application I use for my research tasks is <a href="http://pychem.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">PyChem</a>. PyChem is an application for data analysis (classification, PCAs, etc). Like Gui2Exe, but differently to others GUIs mentioned above, it uses 'new style' widgets ('2D feeling'), so it is interesting in this respect. It shows how to implement data grids and several kind of graphics, and makes intensive use of numpy/scipy and biopython libraries.</p>

<p><strong>BoaConstructor</strong>
Not sure if it has been mentioned before. <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/boa-constructor/files/" rel="nofollow">BoaConstructor</a> is one of the classic python IDEs. I have not used it very often myself because I feel more comfortable with SPE combined with <a href="http://wxglade.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">wxglade</a> (hell! wxglade is another wxpython application!). It combines GUI building  with code building. Unfortunately I'm not sure about how alive the project is. Maybe you should check SVN because the last builds were made in 2007. </p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>If you're on Debian or Ubuntu, there's a neat tool called apt-rdepends which lists package dependencies.</p>

<p><code>apt-rdepends --reverse python-wxtools</code></p>

<p>This gives me a list of three programs that apparently depend on wxPython:</p>

<ul>
<li>model-builder</li>
<li>pyragua</li>
<li>spe</li>
</ul>

<p>Not that many, and SPE was already mentioned; but for the next time, now you know how to find them :-)</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I'm a contributer to <a href="http://www.phatch.org" rel="nofollow">Phatch</a> so that may sound a bit biased. But phatch has a clean, simple yet great looking UI. We gave a talk about it in PyCon 2010: <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2010/conference/schedule/event/38/" rel="nofollow">Cross platform application development and distribution</a>. You can find more details and tips in our paper. Especially in the <a href="http://us.pycon.org/media/2010/talkdata/PyCon2010/038/paper.html#cross-platform-gui-development" rel="nofollow">Cross-Platform GUI Development section</a>. All the GUI examples use wxPython.</p>

<p>The paper focuses on solving cross platform issues and making good design decision. But it can still help even if you are only developing for windows.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p><a href="http://mockupscreens.com/" rel="nofollow">Mockup Screens</a> is a Windows program written in wxpython.</p>

<p><a href="http://mockupscreens.com/index.php?page=Screen-Prototypes" rel="nofollow">Screenshots here</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.taskcoach.org/" rel="nofollow">Task Coach</a> uses some pretty advanced widgets + AUI.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>It's a game tool, but Wrye Mash has a good GUI and uses wxPython. It uses colors heavily and plenty of other features, and looks and feels like any other GUI.</p>

<p><a href="http://wryemusings.com/Wrye+Mash.html" rel="nofollow">http://wryemusings.com/Wrye+Mash.html</a></p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/ulipad/" rel="nofollow">Ulipad IDE</a> is quite good looking program written in wxPython</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>I've tried to maintain native platform consistencies with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/dicompyler/" rel="nofollow">dicompyler</a> via wxPython. Some widgets are custom, some are drawn using wxGraphicsContext and one of the widgets is using matplotlib.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>The SaaS Test Management software <a href="http://www.testuff.com/screenshots" rel="nofollow" title="TestStuff">testuff</a>.</p>

<p>Check the bottom of the Services page to see the Python tools they used, including wxPython.</p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>Trelby is a screenwriting program written in wxPython.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.trelby.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.trelby.org</a></p>

<p>The editor is a custom control, and so is the TAB. So a large part of the interface is tuned to the program's needs.</p>
