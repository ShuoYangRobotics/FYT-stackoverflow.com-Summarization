<h3>Question (ID-746774):</h3><h2>Basic python. Quick question regarding calling a function</h2><p>I've got a basic problem in python, and I would be glad for some help :-)</p>

<p>I have two functions. One that convert a text file to a dictionary. And one that splits a sentence into separate words: </p>

<p>(This is the functiondoc.txt)</p>

<pre><code>def autoparts():

    list_of_parts= open('list_of_parts.txt', 'r')
    for line in list_of_parts:
        k, v= line.split()
        list1.append(k)
        list2.append(v)

    dictionary = dict(zip(k, v))

def splittext(text):
    words = text.split()

    print words
</code></pre>

<p>Now I want to make a program that uses these two functions. </p>

<p>(this is the program.txt)</p>

<pre><code>from functiondoc import *

# A and B are keys in the dict. The values are 'rear_bumper' 'back_seat'
text = 'A B'    # Input

# Splits the input into separate strings.
input_ = split_line(text)
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the part I cant get right. I need to use the <code>autoparts</code> function to output the values (<code>rear_bumper back_seat</code>), but I'm not sure how to call that function so it does that. I don't think it's that hard. But I can't figure it out...</p>

<p>Kind Regards,</p>

<ul>
<li>You should not name Python source files ".txt", you should use ".py".</li>
<li>Your indents look wrong, but that might just be Stack Overflow.</li>
<li>You need to call the <code>autoparts()</code> function to set up the dictionary.</li>
<li>The <code>autoparts()</code> function should probably return the dictionary, to make it usable by other code.</li>
<li>When <code>open</code>ing a text file, you should use the <code>t</code> mode specifier. On some platforms, the lower-level I/O code must know that it is reading text, so you need to tell it.</li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>In addition to all of the other hints and tips, I think you're missing something crucial: your functions actually need to <em>return</em> something.</p>

<p>When you create <code>autoparts()</code> or <code>splittext()</code>, the idea is that this will be a function that you can call, and it can (and should) give something back.</p>

<p>Once you figure out the output that you want your function to have, you need to put it in a <code>return</code> statement.</p>

<p>For example, if you wanted to <code>splittext</code> to return the list of words, rather than print them, you would need the line <code>return words</code>. If you want your <code>autoparts</code> to return the dictionary you've built, you would use <code>return dictionary</code>.</p>

<p>To be more precise (and to answer your comment/question below): you don't want to "return a function that makes a dictionary"; you want to return the dictionary while inside the function. So, the last line of your function should be <code>return dictionary</code> (inside the function!) See, for example, the (accepted!) solution from dbr, above.</p>

<p>I think you need to go back to the beginning and read a book or website about python in particular and programming in general, since you are slightly rusty on some of the concepts. One good one (others are available, of course) is <a href="http://diveintopython.org/" rel="nofollow">http://diveintopython.org/</a></p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>As people have pointed out, you need to use the <code>py</code> extension for python source files. Your files would become "functiondoc.py" and "program.py". This will make your <code>import functiondoc</code> work correctly (as long as they are in the same directory)</p>

<p>The biggest problem with the <code>autoparts</code> function is you never returned anything. The other big problem is you used the wrong variable..</p>

<pre><code>for line in list_of_parts:
    k, v = line.split()
    list1.append(k)
    list2.append(v)

# k and v are now the last line split up, *not* the list you've been constructing.
# The following incorrect line:
dictionary = dict(zip(k, v))
# ...should be:
dictionary = dict(zip(list1, list2))
# ..although you shouldn't use zip for this:
</code></pre>

<p>You almost <em>never</em> have to use <code>zip</code>, there are times when it can be useful, but for creating a simple dict, it's incorrect.. Instead of doing..</p>

<pre><code>for line in list_of_parts:
    ...
dictionary = dict(zip(k, v))
</code></pre>

<p>..simply create an empty dict before the loop, then do mydict[key_variable] = value_variable</p>

<p>For example, how I might have written the function..</p>

<pre><code>def autoparts():
    # open() returns a file object, not the contents of the file,
    # you need to use .read() or .readlines() to get the actual text
    input_file = open('list_of_parts.txt', 'r')
    all_lines = input_file.read_lines() # reads files as a list (one index per line)

    mydict = {} # initialise a empty dictionary

    for line in list_of_parts:
        k, v = line.split()
        mydict[k] = v

    return mydict # you have to explicitly return stuff, or it returns None
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Don't bother creating the lists first, just go straight to the dictionary:</p>

<pre><code>parts_dict={}
list_of_parts = open('list_of_parts.txt', 'r')
for line in list_of_parts:
        k, v = line.split()
        parts_dict[k] = v
</code></pre>

<p>Also, are these keys unique? Because if not some of the values will get overwritten.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>There are a lot of problems with what you've written so far, but your question was how to call the auto parts function. Here's how; first, rename your files to functiondocs.py and program.py - they're python so make them python files.</p>

<p>Next, to call the autoparts function, you simply change your main program listing from:</p>

<pre><code>from functiondoc import *

# A and B are keys in the dict. The values are 'rear_bumper' 'back_seat'
text = 'A B'    # Input

# Splits the input into separate strings.
input_ = split_line(text)
</code></pre>

<p>to:</p>

<pre><code>from functiondoc import *

# Call the autparts function
autoparts()
</code></pre>

<p>In my opinion, it looks like you're asking us to do a CS homework assignment.. but maybe I'm just cynical ;-)</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Here's about the simplest way you could do this:</p>

<pre><code>def filetodict(filename):
    return dict(line.split() for line in open(filename))

parts = filetodict("list_of_parts.txt")
print parts
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the output:</p>

<pre><code>{'a': 'apple', 'c': 'cheese', 'b': 'bacon', 'e': 'egg', 'd': 'donut'}
</code></pre>

<p>The file contents:</p>

<pre><code>a apple
b bacon
c cheese
d donut
e egg
</code></pre>
