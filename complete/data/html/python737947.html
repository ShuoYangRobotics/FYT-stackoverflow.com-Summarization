<h3>Question (ID-737947):</h3><h2>Scratch disks in Python?</h2><p>I understood that in certain Windows XP programs, like Photoshop, there is something called "scratch disks". What I understood that this means, and please correct me if I'm wrong, is that Photoshop manages its own virtual memory on the hard-drive, instead of letting Windows manage it. I understood that the reason for this is some limitation by Windows XP on how much total memory a process can take, regardless of HD space. I think it's around 3 GB. Did I get it right so far?</p>

<p>I am making an application in Python for running simulations. It will take a lot of memory, and will run on Windows XP. Is it possible for it to use scratch disks? How?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Until you ACTUALLY run out of memory, thinking about this is a waste of time.</p>

<p>When you finally do run out of memory, you'll need to use a temporary file to store objects that your process needs, but can't fit into memory.</p>

<p>Use pickle or shelve (see <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/persistence.html" rel="nofollow">Data Persistence</a>) your objects in a file.  If that file happens to be on a disk named "scratch", well that's nice.</p>

<p>Sometimes you want your temporary files to be on a separate disk from your other working files for performance reasons.  In some environments (SAN, NAS, storage arrays) your disks are virtual and looking for a "scratch" disk doesn't have any performance benefit.  In other environments (i.e., you own all the hardware) you can put temporary files on some other drive, making that drive a "scratch" disk.</p>

<p>Just an FYI, this is more a limitation of a 32-bit OS rather than being a Windows XP problem.  You'll have the same problem in 32-bit Vista, linux, bsd... you get the idea.  If you go the 64-bit route, you don't have these problems.</p>

<p>For example, Windows XP x64 allows up to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows%5Fxp%5Ftablet%5Fpc%5Fedition#Advantages" rel="nofollow">8 terabytes of memory per process</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Scratch disks will benefit your application in the case that it works with very big files, </p>

<p>Is that the case? </p>

<p>If not, then i don't think you may find something that will benefit your application in scratch disks.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p><a href="http://docs.python.org/library/mmap.html" rel="nofollow">Memory mapped files</a> might be what you are looking for.  Python's implementation lets you use a file like a mutable string in memory.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>The Win32 API provides this: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa366527%28VS.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">link text</a>.
You may be able to use these functions through PyWin32.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You could combine S.Lott's answer about using pickle (you should use cPickle though for better performance) with SqlLite.</p>

<p>sqlite is built into python 2.5 and up, so all you'll need to do is import :), then just store the pickled objects as strings in there and you'll have a nice fast method of accessing the data (compared to building your own method) that will help keep you organized as well.</p>

<p>note: cPickle is almost identical to pickle in use. Only difference is that it is written in C</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong>: It may be a good idea to have a user controlled memory usage limit. It would be a shame to be storing a bunch a data on disk and waiting on slow-ass disk I/O when the user has 8GB of RAM ;)</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>You are probably looking for something like ZODB.  However, though ZODB tries hard to be transparent, no solution is going to be 100% free of artifacts.  You have to write your code with an awareness that your objects primarily live in a database, but that there are multiple representations of your objects, there are caching/syncing issues, etc.  Nothing is going to make this very difficult problem completely trivial for you.</p>
