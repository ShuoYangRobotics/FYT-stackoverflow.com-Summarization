<h3>Question (ID-458340):</h3><h2>Is there a better layout language than HTML for printing?</h2><p>I'm using Python and Qt 4.4 and I have to print some pages. Initially I thought I'd use HTML with CSS to produce those pages. But HTML has some limitations.</p>

<p>Now the question is: is there anything that's better than HTML but just (or almost) as easy to use? Additionally, it should be GPL-compatible.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p><em>kdgregory &amp; Mark G:</em> The most obvious limitation is that I can't specify the printer margins. There is another problem: How do I add page numbers?</p>

<p><em>Jeremy French:</em> One thing I have to print is a list of all the products someone ordered which can spread over a few pages.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I have been fighting with printed (or PDF) output from Python for 8 years now and so far I came across the following approaches (in order of personal preference):</p>

<ul>
<li>Using <a href="http://www.jaspersoft.com/JasperSoft%5FJasperReports.html?utm%5Fsource=google&amp;utm%5Fmedium=cpc&amp;utm%5Fcontent=JasperReports&amp;utm%5Fcampaign=JasperReportsSearchjasperreports" rel="nofollow">JasperReports</a> via <a href="http://cybernetics.hudora.biz/projects/wiki/pyJasper" rel="nofollow">pyJasper</a> (written by me) or <a href="http://blogs.23.nu/c0re/2008/07/antville-18473/" rel="nofollow">JasperServer</a>. You can use the WYSIWYG design tool <a href="http://www.jaspersoft.com/JasperSoft%5FiReport.html" rel="nofollow">iReport</a> to define your layout. Your Python code will contact the Java based Jasper engine via HTTP and make it render a PDF (pyJasper handles that). We use that for a few thousand pages a day.</li>
<li>Use plain text output. You can't get any faster. We use that for a few hundred pages per day.</li>
<li>Use XSLT-FO. You also have to call a Java based rendering engine like FOB. Might result in performance issues but can be mitigated by having a long running Java server process  - same approach than with Jasper. We use that for a few hundred pages per day but writing XSLT-FO documents made my head hurt. Not used for new code.</li>
<li>Generate <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/" rel="nofollow">LaTeX</a> source and use a latex software package to render to PDF. Getting LaTeX to look like <strong>you</strong> like is quite difficult. But as long as you go with the provided LaTeX styles, you are fine. Not used in production at my shop.</li>
<li>PDF generation with the <a href="http://www.reportlab.org/rl%5Ftoolkit.html" rel="nofollow">ReportLab Toolkit</a>. Somewhat low level. Even more low level: <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyFPDF/" rel="nofollow">FPDF</a>. We use FPDF-Ruby for a few hundred pages a day. Took a lot of fiddeling to get the layout we wanted.</li>
<li>Directly generate Postscript. Strange but you nearly can't get more in terms of speed and control. We used that to generate contact sheets with a few hundred thousand Jpegs per day. Takes fiddling but is fun.</li>
<li>use <a href="http://www.troff.org/" rel="nofollow">troff</a>/groff to generate Postscript/PDF. Very low level bute nice to do simple, high volume things. Never used it thus in production.</li>
</ul>

<p>For orders, invoices and the like I highly recommend JasperReports. The ability to use a visual editor to define the layout is a huge time saver.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>There's LaTeX. Not sure if that falls into the "as easy to use as html" category, but it's not hard. </p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>By <em>print</em> do you mean a printer? If so, check <a href="http://www.reportlab.org/" rel="nofollow">ReportLab</a>'s PDF tools.</p>

<pre><code>from reportlab.pdfgen import canvas
from reportlab.lib.units import cm
c = canvas.Canvas("hello.pdf")
c.drawString(9*cm, 22*cm, "Hello World!")
c.showPage()
c.save()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>XSL Formatting Objects (part of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/" rel="nofollow">The Extensible Stylesheet Language Family (XSL)</a>) if you need <em>total</em> control over printed documents.</p>

<p>Then, you'll need a Formatting Objects processor, like <a href="http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/" rel="nofollow">FOP</a> or <a href="http://www.antennahouse.com/" rel="nofollow">Antenna house</a>, to transform the XSL-FO document into PDF, or PostScript.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You might consider <a href="http://sphinx.pocoo.org/" rel="nofollow">Sphinx</a>, a package that translates reStructuredText files into various output formats, including HTML, and LaTeX, for printable PDF.  It's licensed under BSD and is now the official Python documentation tool.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>What's wrong with just using <a href="http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/printing.html" rel="nofollow">Qt's native printing</a>?</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Or if you're on a mac, you could check out <a href="http://developer.apple.com/DOCUMENTATION/GraphicsImaging/Conceptual/drawingwithquartz2d/dq_python/chapter_17_section_1.html" rel="nofollow">quartz bindings for Python</a>, but it's obviously not GPL.</p>
