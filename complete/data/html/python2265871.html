<h3>Question (ID-2265871):</h3><h2>showing list item in python</h2><p>I want to manipulate feed which contains frequently updated (with time) contents using feed parser. Goal is to show all the contents of the updated feed.</p>

<pre><code>import feedparser
d = feedparser.parse("some URL")

print "Information of user" 
i = range(10)

for i in d:
    print d.entries[i].summary 

print " " 
</code></pre>

<p>As parsing data is list, and list don't accept string as indices, it shows error</p>

<p>like:</p>

<pre><code>File "F:\JavaWorkspace\Test\src\rss_parse.py", line 18, in &lt;module&gt;
print d.entries[i].summary 
TypeError: list indices must be integers
</code></pre>

<p>Then how can I get all contents? can anyone please show me some light on this issue? Thanks in advance!</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p><code>i</code> is not an integer. I guess <code>i</code> is already an entry of the feed but better rename it:</p>

<p>Try: </p>

<pre><code>for entry in d.entries:
  print entry.summary
</code></pre>

<p>If you want the first 10 entries you have to do:</p>

<pre><code>try:
  for i in range(10):
    print d.entries[i].summary
except IndexError:
  pass
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><pre><code>for i in range(10):
    print d.entries[i].summary
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You first assign a list of integers to i (<code>i = range(10)</code>) and then just lose the reference to this list. Are you sure you didn't mean:</p>

<pre><code>r = range(10)

for i in r:
</code></pre>

<p>or simply:</p>

<pre><code>for i in range(10):
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>for all entries make:</p>

<pre><code>import feedparser
d = feedparser.parse("some URL")

print "Information of user" 

for i in range(len(d['entries'])):
    print d.entries[i].summary 

print " "
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><pre><code>import feedparser
from StringIO import StringIO
d = feedparser.parse("some URL")
buff = StringIO()
print &gt;&gt;buff, "Information of user" 

for i,e in enumerate(d.entries):
    print &gt;&gt;buff, i, e.summary 

print &gt;&gt;buff," "
print buff
</code></pre>

<p>If you need the index, I suggest also to use a String Buffer to do I/O operations on big string.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Say you want to print the 10 first elements of the list if there is 10 or more, or what it contains otherwise. Felix allready proposed a working solution with exception management. You could also use itertools like below. </p>

<pre><code>import feedparser
d = feedparser.parse('http://feedparser.org/docs/examples/atom10.xml')

from itertools import islice

for elt in islice(d.entries, 1, 10):
    print elt.summary
</code></pre>

<p>What is nice with islice is that if you want to access to elements from say 3 to 10 (a slice) it also works as easily. Just have to replace 1 with 3. It also works with step if you want say only even elements, etc.</p>
