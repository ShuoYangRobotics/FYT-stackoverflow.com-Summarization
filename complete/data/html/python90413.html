<h3>Question (ID-90413):</h3><h2>what is the best/easiest to use encryption library in python</h2><p>I want to encrypt few files using python what is the best way
i can use gpg but are there any standarad/famous python libraries?</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Try <a href="http://code.google.com/p/keyczar/">KeyCzar</a> </p>

<p>Very easy to implement. </p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I use <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/related_software/gpgme/index.en.html" rel="nofollow">GPGme</a> The main strength of GPGme is that it read and writes files at the OpenPGP standard (<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4880.txt" rel="nofollow">RFC 4880</a>) which can be important if you want to interoperate with other PGP programs. </p>

<p>It has a <a href="http://pyme.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">Python interface</a>. Warning: it is a low-level interface, not very Pythonic.</p>

<p>If you read French, <a href="http://www.bortzmeyer.org/gpgme.html" rel="nofollow">see examples</a>.</p>

<p>Here is one, to check a signature:</p>

<pre><code>signed = core.Data(sys.stdin.read())
plain = core.Data()
context = core.Context()

context.op_verify(signed, None, plain)
result = context.op_verify_result()

sign = result.signatures
while sign:
    if sign.status != 0:
        print "BAD signature from:"
    else:
        print "Good signature from:"
    print "  uid:        ", context.get_key(sign.fpr, 0).uids.uid
    print "  timestamp:  ", sign.timestamp
    print "  fingerprint:", sign.fpr
    sign = sign.next
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>See Google's <a href="http://code.google.com/p/keyczar/" rel="nofollow">Keyczar</a> project, which provides  a nice  set of interfaces to PyCrypto's functionality.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I use <a href="http://www.egenix.com/products/python/pyOpenSSL/" rel="nofollow">pyOpenSSL</a>, its a python binding for <a href="http://www.openssl.org/" rel="nofollow">OpenSSL</a> which has been around for a long time and is very well tested.  I did some benchmarks for my application, which is very crypto intensive and it won hands down against pyCrypto.  YMMV.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I like pyDes (<a href="http://twhiteman.netfirms.com/des.html" rel="nofollow">http://twhiteman.netfirms.com/des.html</a>). It's not the quickest, but it's pure Python and works very well for small amounts of encrypted data.</p>
