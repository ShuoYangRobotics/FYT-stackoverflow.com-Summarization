<h3>Question (ID-1401218):</h3><h2>CRC32 to make short URL for web</h2><p>I am trying to understand crc32 to generate the unique url for web page.</p>

<p>If we use the crc32, what is the maximum number of urls can be used so that we can avoid duplicates?</p>

<p>What could be the approximative string length to keep the checksum to be 2^32?</p>

<p>When I tried UUID for an url and convert the uuid bytes to base 64, I could reduce to 22 chars long. I wonder I can reduce still further.</p>

<p>Mostly I want to convert the url (maximum 1024 chars) to shorted id.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>There is no such number as the "maximum number of urls can be used so that we can avoid duplicates" for CRC32.</p>

<p>The problem is that CRC32 can produce duplicates, and it's not a function of how many values you throw at it, it's a function of what those values look like.</p>

<p>So you might have a collision on the second url, if you're unlucky.</p>

<p>You should not base your algorithm on producing a unique hash, instead produce a unique value for each url manually.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>If you're already storing the full URL in a database table, an integer ID is pretty short, and can be made shorter by converting it to base 16, 64, or 85. If you can use a UUID, you can use an integer, and you may as well, since it's shorter and I don't see what benefit a UUID would provide in your lookup table.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>CRC32 means <em>cyclic redundancy check</em> with 32 bits where any arbitrary amount of bits is summed up to a 32 bit check sum. And check sum functions are surjective, that means multiple input values have the same output value. So you cannot inverse the function.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>No, even you use md5, or any other check sum, the URL CAN BE duplicate, it all depends on your luck.</p>

<p>So don't make an unique url base on those check sum</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>The right way to make a short URL is to store the full one in the database and publish something that maps to the row index.  A compact way is to use the Base64 of the row ID, for example.  Or you could use a UID for the primary key and show that.</p>

<p>Do not use a checksum, because it's too small and very likely to conflict.  A cryptographic hash is larger and less likely, but it's still not the right way to go.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>The quickest (and perhaps best!) way to solve things may be to simply use a hash of the local path and query of a given URI, as follows:</p>

<pre><code>using System;

namespace HashSample
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Uri uri = new Uri(
                "http://host.com/folder/file.jpg?code=ABC123");

            string hash = GetPathAndQueryHash(uri);

            Console.WriteLine(hash);
        }

        public static string GetPathAndQueryHash(Uri uri)
        {
            return uri.PathAndQuery.GetHashCode().ToString();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The above presumes that the URI scheme and host remain the same.  If not GetHashCode will work with any string.</p>
