<h3>Question (ID-1241703):</h3><h2>Controlling getter and setter for a python's class</h2><p>Consider the following class :</p>

<pre><code>class Token:
    def __init__(self):
        self.d_dict = {}

    def __setattr__(self, s_name, value):
        self.d_dict[s_name] = value

    def __getattr__(self, s_name):
        if s_name in self.d_dict.keys():
            return self.d_dict[s_name]
        else:
            raise AttributeError('No attribute {0} found !'.format(s_name))
</code></pre>

<p>In my code Token have some other function (like get_all() wich return d_dict, has(s_name) which tell me if my token has a particular attribute).</p>

<p>Anyway, I think their is a flaw in my plan since it don't work : when I create a new instance, python try to call <code>__setattr__('d_dict', '{}')</code>.</p>

<p>How can I achieve a similar behaviour (maybe in a more pythonic way ?) without having to write something like Token.set(name, value) and get(name) each I want to set or get an attribute for a token.</p>

<p>Critics about design flaw and/or stupidity welcome :)</p>

<p>Thank !</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The special-casing of <code>__dict__</code> works like this:</p>

<pre><code>def __init__(self):
    self.__dict__['d_dict'] = {}
</code></pre>

<p>There is no need to use a new-style class for that.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>the problem seems to be in time of evaluation of your code in __init__ method.
You could define __new__ method and initialize d_dict variable there instead of __init__.
Thats a bit hackish but it works, remember though to comment it as after few months it'll be total magic.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class  Foo(object):
...     def __new__(cls, *args):
...             my_cls = super(Foo, cls).__new__(cls, *args)
...             my_cls.d_dict = {}
...             return my_cls

&gt;&gt;&gt; f = Foo()
&gt;&gt;&gt; id(f.d_dict)
3077948796L
&gt;&gt;&gt; d = Foo()
&gt;&gt;&gt; id(d.d_dict)
3078142804L
</code></pre>

<p>Word of explanation why I consider that hackish: call to __new__ returns new instance of <em>class</em> so then <em>d_dict</em> initialised in there is kind of <strong>static</strong>, but it's initialised with new instance of dictionary each time class is "<em>created</em>" so everything works as you need.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You need to special-case d_dict.</p>

<p>Although of course, in the above code, all you do is replicate what any object does with <code>__dict__</code> already, so it's pretty pointless. Do I guess correctly if you intended to special case some attributes and actally use methods for those?</p>

<p>In that case, you can use properties.</p>

<pre><code>class C(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self._x = None

    @property
    def x(self):
        """I'm the 'x' property."""
        return self._x

    @x.setter
    def x(self, value):
        self._x = value

    @x.deleter
    def x(self):
        del self._x
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>A solution, not very pythonic but works. As Lennart Regebro pointed, you have to use a special case for d_dict.</p>

<pre><code>class Token(object):

    def __init__(self):
        super(Token,self).__setattr__('d_dict', {})

    def __getattr__(self,name):
        return self.a[name]

    def __setattr__(self,name,value):
        self.a[name] = value
</code></pre>

<p>You need to use new style classes.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>It's worth remembering that <code>__getattr__</code> is only called if the attribute doesn't exist in the object, whereas <code>__setattr__</code> is always called.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I think we'll be able to say something about the overall design of your class if you explain its purpose. For example, </p>

<pre><code># This is a class that serves as a dictionary but also has user-defined methods
class mydict(dict): pass

# This is a class that allows setting x.attr = value or getting x.attr:
class mysetget: pass

# This is a class that allows setting x.attr = value or getting x.attr:
class mygetsethas: 
    def has(self, key):
        return key in self.__dict__

x = mygetsethas()
x.a = 5
print(x.has('a'), x.a)
</code></pre>

<p>I think the last class is closest to what you meant, and I also like to play with syntax and get lots of joy from it, but unfortunately this is not a good thing. Reasons why it's not advisable to use object attributes to re-implement dictionary: you can't use <code>x.3</code>, you conflict with <code>x.has()</code>, you have to put quotes in <code>has('a')</code> and many more.</p>
