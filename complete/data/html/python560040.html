<h3>Question (ID-560040):</h3><h2>Conditional compilation in Python</h2><p>How to do conditional compilation in Python ?</p>

<p>Is it using DEF ?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Python isn't compiled in the same sense as C or C++ or even Java, python files are compiled "on the fly", you can think of it as being similar to a interpreted language like Basic or Perl.<sub>1</sub></p>

<p>You can do something equivalent to conditional compile by just using an if statement. For example:</p>

<pre><code>if FLAG:
    def f():
        print "Flag is set"
else:
    def f():
        print "Flag is not set"
</code></pre>

<p>You can do the same for the creation classes, setting of variables and pretty much everything.</p>

<p>The closest way to mimic IFDEF would be to use the hasattr function. E.g.:</p>

<pre><code>if hasattr(aModule, 'FLAG'):
    # do stuff if FLAG is defined in the current module.
</code></pre>

<p>You could also use a try/except clause to catch name errors, but the idiomatic way would be to set a variable to None at the top of your script.</p>

<li>Python code is byte compiled into an intermediate form like Java, however there generally isn't a separate compilation step. The "raw" source files that end in .py are executable.</li>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>There is actually a way to get conditional compilation, but it's very limited.</p>

<pre><code>if __debug__:
    doSomething()
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>__debug__</code> flag is a special case.  When calling python with the <code>-O</code> or <code>-OO</code> options, <code>__debug__</code> will be false, and the compiler will ignore that statement.  This is used primarily with asserts, which is why assertions go away if you 'really compile' your scripts with optimization.</p>

<p>So if your goal is to add debugging code, but prevent it from slowing down or otherwise affecting a 'release' build, this does what you want.  But you cannot assign a value to <code>__debug__</code>, so that's about all you can use it for.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Doesn't make much sense in a dynamic environment. If you are looking for conditional definition of functions, you can use <code>if</code>:</p>

<pre><code>if happy:
    def makemehappy():
        return "I'm good"
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Python compiles a module automatically when you import it, so the only way to avoid compiling it is to not import it. You can write something like:</p>

<pre><code>if some_condition:
  import some_module
</code></pre>

<p>But that would only work for complete modules. In C and C++ you typically use a preprocessor for conditional compilation. There is nothing stopping you from using a preprocessor on your Python code, so you could write something like:</p>

<pre><code>#ifdef SOME_CONDITION
def some_function():
  pass
#endif
</code></pre>

<p>Run that through a C preprocessor and you'd have real conditional compilation and <code>some_function</code> will only be defined if <code>SOME_CONDITION</code> is defined.</p>

<p>BUT (and this is important): Conditional compilation is probably not what you want. Remember that when you import a module, Python simply executes the code in it. The def and class statements in the module are actually <em>executed</em> when you import the module. So the typical way of implementing what other languages would use conditional compilation for is just a normal if statement, like:</p>

<pre><code>if some_condition:
  def some_function():
    pass
</code></pre>

<p>This will only define <code>some_function</code> if <code>some_condition</code> is true.</p>

<p>It's stuff like this that makes dynamic languages so powerful while remaining conceptually simple.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Use <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pypreprocessor/" rel="nofollow">pypreprocessor</a></p>

<p>Which can also be found on <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pypreprocessor" rel="nofollow">PYPI (Python Package Index)</a> and can be fetched using pip.</p>

<p>The basic example of usage is:</p>

<pre><code>from pypreprocessor import pypreprocessor

pypreprocessor.parse()

#define debug

#ifdef debug
print('The source is in debug mode')
#else
print('The source is not in debug mode')
#endif
</code></pre>

<p>You can also output the postprocessed code to a file by specifying...</p>

<pre><code>pypreprocessor.output = 'output_file_name.py'
</code></pre>

<p>anywhere between the pypreprocessor import and the call to parse().</p>

<p>The module is essentially the python implementation of C preprocessor conditional compilation.</p>
