<h3>Question (ID-276761):</h3><h2>Exposing a C++ API to Python</h2><p>I'm currently working on a project were I had to wrap the C++ classes with Python to be able to script the program. So my specific experience also involved embedding the Python interpreter in our program.</p>

<p>The alternatives I tried were:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Boost.Python</p>

<p>I liked the cleaner API produced by Boost.Python, but the fact that it would have required that users install an additional dependency made us switch to SWIG.</p></li>
<li><p>SWIG</p>

<p>SWIG's main advantage for us was that it doesn't require end users to install it to use the final program.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>What have you used to do this, and what has been your experience with it?</p>

<p><strong>Great</strong> integration with C++ types, and creates a single .cpp file to compile and include in your shared object.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I've used both (for the same project): Boost is better integrated with the STL, and especially C++ exceptions.  Also, its memory management mechanism (which tries to bridge C++ memory management and Python GC) is way more flexible than SWIG's.  However, SWIG has <em>much</em> better documentation, no external dependencies, and if you get the library wrapped in SWIG for Python you're more than half-way there to getting a Java/Perl/Ruby wrapper as well.</p>

<p>I don't think there's a clear-cut choice: for smaller projects, I'd go with Boost.Python again, for larger long-lived projects, the extra investment in SWIG is worth it.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/greg.ewing/python/Pyrex/" rel="nofollow">pyrex</a> or <a href="http://cython.org/" rel="nofollow">cython</a> are also good and easy ways for mixing the two worlds.</p>

<p>Wrapping C++ using these tools is a bit trickier then wrapping C but it can be done. <a href="http://wiki.cython.org/WrappingCPlusPlus" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is the wiki page about it.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I suggest <a href="http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/sip/intro" rel="nofollow">SIP</a>. SIP is better than SWIG due to the following reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>For a given set of files, swig generates more duplicate (overhead) code than SIP. SIP manages to generate less duplicate (overhead) code by using a library file which can be statically or dynamically linked. In other words SIP has better scalability.</p></li>
<li><p>Execution time of SIP is much less than that of SWIG. Refer <a href="http://people.web.psi.ch/geus/talks/europython2004_geus.pdf" rel="nofollow">Python Wrapper Tools: A Performance Study</a>. Unfortunately link appears broken. I have a personal copy which can be shared on request.</p></li>
</ol>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>A big plus for Boost::Python is that it allows for tab completion in the ipython shell: You import a C++ class, exposed by Boost directly, or you subclass it, and from then on, it really behaves like a pure Python class.</p>

<p>The downside: It takes so long to install and use Boost that all the  Tab-completion time-saving won't ever amortize ;-(</p>

<p>So I prefer Swig: No bells and whistles, but works reliably after a short introductory example.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Does boost.python require any dependacy for the python consumer?  I thought
it staticaly linked with the c++ library you were exposing?</p>

<p>There is also <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/python-sip/" rel="nofollow">SIP</a> which is similair to SWIG, but I don't have any experience of it.</p>
