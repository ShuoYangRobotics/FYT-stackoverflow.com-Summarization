<p>Hi there,</p>

<p>This question is similar to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16248/getting-the-subversion-repository-number-into-code">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16248/getting-the-subversion-repository-number-into-code</a></p>

<p>The differences being:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I would like to add the revision number to Python</p></li>
<li><p>I want the revision of the repository (not the checked out file)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I.e. I would like to extract the Revision number from the return from 'svn info', likeso:</p>

<p>$ svn info</p>

<pre><code>Path: .
URL: svn://localhost/B/trunk
Repository Root: svn://localhost/B
Revision: 375
Node Kind: directory
Schedule: normal
Last Changed Author: bmh
Last Changed Rev: 375
Last Changed Date: 2008-10-27 12:09:00 -0400 (Mon, 27 Oct 2008)
</code></pre>

<p>I want a variable with 375 (the Revision). It's easy enough with put $Rev$ into a variable to keep track of changes on a file. However, I would like to keep track of the repository's version, and I understand (and it seems based on my tests) that $Rev$ only updates when the file changes.</p>

<p>My initial thoughts turn to using the svn/libsvn module built in to Python, though I can't find any documentation on or examples of how to use them.</p>

<p>Alternatively, I've thought calling 'svn info' and regex'ing the code out, though that seems rather brutal. :)</p>

<p>Help would be most appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks &amp; Cheers.</p>

<pre><code>def get_svn_revision(path=None):
    rev = None
    if path is None:
        path = MODULE.__path__[0]
    entries_path = '%s/.svn/entries' % path

    if os.path.exists(entries_path):
        entries = open(entries_path, 'r').read()
        # Versions &gt;= 7 of the entries file are flat text.  The first line is
        # the version number. The next set of digits after 'dir' is the revision.
        if re.match('(\d+)', entries):
            rev_match = re.search('\d+\s+dir\s+(\d+)', entries)
            if rev_match:
                rev = rev_match.groups()[0]
        # Older XML versions of the file specify revision as an attribute of
        # the first entries node.
        else:
            from xml.dom import minidom
            dom = minidom.parse(entries_path)
            rev = dom.getElementsByTagName('entry')[0].getAttribute('revision')

    if rev:
        return u'SVN-%s' % rev
    return u'SVN-unknown'
</code></pre>

<p>Adapt as appropriate. YOu might want to change MODULE for the name of one of your codemodules.</p>

<p>This code has the advantage of working even if the destination system does not have subversion installed.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Python has direct bindings to libsvn, so you don't need to invoke the command line client at all. See <a href="http://jtauber.com/python_subversion_binding/" rel="nofollow">this blog post</a> for more details.</p>

<p>EDIT: You can basically do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>from svn import fs, repos, core
repository = repos.open(root_path)
fs_ptr = repos.fs(repository)
youngest_revision_number = fs.youngest_rev(fs_ptr)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>There is a command called <code>svnversion</code> which comes with subversion and is meant to solve exactly that kind of problem.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I use a technique very similar to this in order to show the current subversion revision number in my shell:</p>

<pre><code>svnRev=$(echo "$(svn info)" | grep "^Revision" | awk -F": " '{print $2};')
echo $svnRev
</code></pre>

<p>It works very well for me.</p>

<p>Why do you want the python files to change every time the version number of the entire repository is incremented? This will make doing things like doing a diff between two files annoying if one is from the repo, and the other is from a tarball..</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>If you want to have a variable in one source file that can be set to the current working copy revision, and does not replay on subversion and a working copy being actually available at the time you run your program, then <a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-subwcrev.html" rel="nofollow">SubWCRev</a> my be your solution.</p>

<p>There also seems to be a linux port called <a href="http://svnwcrev.tigris.org/" rel="nofollow">SVNWCRev</a></p>

<p>Both perform substitution of $WCREV$ with the highest commit level of the working copy. Other information may also be provided.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Based on CesarB's response and the link Charles provided, I've done the following:</p>

<pre><code>try:
  from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
  _p = Popen(["svnversion", "."], stdout=PIPE)
  REVISION= _p.communicate()[0]
  _p = None # otherwise we get a wild exception when Django auto-reloads
except Exception, e:
  print "Could not get revision number: ", e
  REVISION="Unknown"
</code></pre>

<p>Golly Python is cool. :)</p>
