<h3>Question (ID-2168522):</h3><h2>python string split</h2><p>I am trying to recognise user typed strings such as "exit" or "add number" using this:</p>

<pre><code> command, data = input('&gt;').split(" ", 1)
</code></pre>

<p>It works for two word input, but not one word of input ("need more than 1 value to unpack").</p>

<p>What is the best way of accepting both one/two word inputs?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Unless you're using Python 3 you shouldn't be using the <code>input</code>-function for user input. Use the <code>raw_input</code>-function instead.</p>

<p>As for the actual question; retrieve the result of the split as a list.</p>

<p>The first item in the list will be the command, and the optional following items will be the "arguments".</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>This is what <code>partition</code> is for:</p>

<pre><code>command, _, data = raw_input('&gt;').partition(" ")
</code></pre>

<p>If only one word was specified, <code>data</code> will be assigned an empty string.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I am certain that someone is going to come up with a "Pythonic" solution, but what ever happened to just accepting it as a list and checking it afterward?</p>

<pre><code>command_data = raw_input('&gt;').split(" ", 1)
if len(command_data) &gt; 1:
  do some brilliant stuff next
</code></pre>

<p>Sorry, I think the C++ side of my brain is getting moody :)</p>

<p>Edit: Maybe str.partition is what you're looking for. At least you're guaranteed a 3-tuple to unpack. Mind you if you ever add a second argument to the command you'll have to find a new solution.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The <em>best</em> way is to build a parser, but if you just want something to work quickly you could just have a list of the commands you want to allow, such as:</p>

<pre><code>commands = ['foo', 'bar', 'exit', 'hello world', 'add number']
</code></pre>

<p>Then for each command check if your input satisfies <code>s.startswith(command)</code>. If so, you can do the appropriate thing for that command.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><pre><code>line = raw_input('&gt;').split(" ", 1)
command = line[0]
data = line[1] if len(line) &gt; 1 else ""
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure you use <code>raw_input</code> if you don't want your data being evaluated as a Python expression.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><pre><code>command, data = (input('&gt;') + ' ').split(" ", 1)
</code></pre>
