<h3>Question (ID-639962):</h3><h2>Unzipping directory structure with python</h2><p>I have a zip file which contains the following directory structure:</p>

<pre><code>dir1\dir2\dir3a
dir1\dir2\dir3b
</code></pre>

<p>I'm trying to unzip it and maintain the directory structure however I get the error:</p>

<pre><code>IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'C:\\\projects\\\testFolder\\\subdir\\\unzip.exe'
</code></pre>

<p>where testFolder is dir1 above and subdir is dir2.</p>

<p>Is there a quick way of unzipping the file and maintaining the directory structure?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The extract and extractall methods are great if you're on Python 2.6.  I have to use Python 2.5 for now, so I just need to create the directories if they don't exist.  You can get a listing of directories with the <code>namelist()</code> method.  The directories will always end with a forward slash (even on Windows) e.g.,</p>

<pre><code>import os, zipfile

z = zipfile.ZipFile('myfile.zip')
for f in z.namelist():
    if f.endswith('/'):
        os.makedirs(f)
</code></pre>

<p>You probably don't want to do it <em>exactly</em> like that (i.e., you'd probably want to extract the contents of the zip file as you iterate over the namelist), but you get the idea.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><strong>Don't</strong> trust extract() or extractall().</p>

<p>These methods blindly extract files to the paths given in their filenames. But ZIP filenames can be anything at all, including dangerous strings like “x/../../../etc/passwd”. Extract such files and you could have just compromised your entire server.</p>

<p>Maybe this should be considered a reportable security hole in Python's zipfile module, but any number of zip-dearchivers have exhibited the exact same behaviour in the past. To unarchive a ZIP file with folder structure safely you need in-depth checking of each file path.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I tried this out, and can reproduce it.  The extractall method, as suggested by other answers, does <strong>not</strong> solve the problem.  This seems like a bug in the zipfile module to me (perhaps Windows-only?), unless I'm misunderstanding how zipfiles are structured.</p>

<pre><code>testa\
testa\testb\
testa\testb\test.log
&gt; test.zip

&gt;&gt;&gt; from zipfile import ZipFile
&gt;&gt;&gt; zipTest = ZipFile("C:\\...\\test.zip")
&gt;&gt;&gt; zipTest.extractall("C:\\...\\")
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  File "...\zipfile.py", line 940, in extractall
  File "...\zipfile.py", line 928, in extract
  File "...\zipfile.py", line 965, in _extract_member
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'C:\\...\\testa\\testb\\test.log'
</code></pre>

<p>If I do a <code>printdir()</code>, I get this (first column):</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; zipTest.printdir()
File Name
testa/testb/
testa/testb/test.log
</code></pre>

<p>If I try to extract just the first entry, like this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; zipTest.extract("testa/testb/")
'C:\\...\\testa\\testb'
</code></pre>

<p>On disk, this results in the creation of a folder <code>testa</code>, with a <strong>file</strong> <code>testb</code> inside.  This is apparently the reason why the subsequent attempt to extract <code>test.log</code> fails; <code>testa\testb</code> is a file, not a folder.</p>

<p>Edit #1: If you extract just the file, then it works:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; zipTest.extract("testa/testb/test.log")
'C:\\...\\testa\\testb\\test.log'
</code></pre>

<p>Edit #2: Jeff's code is the way to go; iterate through <code>namelist</code>; if it's a directory, create the directory.  Otherwise, extract the file.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>There's a very easy way if you're using Python 2.6: the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipFile.extractall" rel="nofollow">extractall</a> method.</p>

<p>However, since the <code>zipfile</code> module is implemented completely in Python without any C extensions, you can probably copy it out of a 2.6 installation and use it with an older version of Python; you may find this easier than having to reimplement the functionality yourself.  However, the function itself is quite short:</p>

<pre><code>def extractall(self, path=None, members=None, pwd=None):
    """Extract all members from the archive to the current working
       directory. `path' specifies a different directory to extract to.
       `members' is optional and must be a subset of the list returned
       by namelist().
    """
    if members is None:
        members = self.namelist()

    for zipinfo in members:
        self.extract(zipinfo, path, pwd)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I know it may be a little late to say this but Jeff is right.
It's as simple as:</p>

<pre><code>import os
from zipfile import ZipFile as zip

def extractAll(zipName):
    z = zip(zipName)
    for f in z.namelist():
        if f.endswith('/'):
            os.makedirs(f)
        else:
            z.extract(f)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    zipList = ['one.zip', 'two.zip', 'three.zip']
    for zip in zipList:
        extractAll(zipName)
</code></pre>

<p>So thanks Jeff you helped me heaps :)</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>It sounds like you are trying to run unzip to extract the zip.</p>

<p>It would be better to use the python <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/zipfile.html" rel="nofollow"><code>zipfile</code></a> module, and therefore do the extraction in python.</p>

<pre><code>import zipfile

def extract(zipfilepath, extractiondir):
    zip = zipfile.ZipFile(zipfilepath)
    zip.extractall(path=extractiondir)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Note that zip files can have entries for directories as well as files. When creating archives with the <code>zip</code> command, pass the <code>-D</code> option to disable adding directory entries explicitly to the archive. When Python 2.6's <code>ZipFile.extractall</code> method runs across a directory entry, it seems to create a <em>file</em> in its place. Since archive entries aren't necessarily in order, this causes <code>ZipFile.extractall</code> to fail quite often, as it tries to create a file in a subdirectory of a file. If you've got an archive that you want to use with the Python module, simply extract it and re-zip it with the <code>-D</code> option. Here's a little snippet I've been using for a while to do exactly that:</p>

<pre><code>P=`pwd` &amp;&amp; 
Z=`mktemp -d -t zip` &amp;&amp; 
pushd $Z &amp;&amp; 
unzip $P/&lt;busted&gt;.zip &amp;&amp; 
zip -r -D $P/&lt;new&gt;.zip . &amp;&amp; 
popd &amp;&amp; 
rm -rf $Z
</code></pre>

<p>Replace <code>&lt;busted&gt;.zip</code> and <code>&lt;new&gt;.zip</code> with real filenames relative to the current directory. Then just copy the whole thing and paste it into a command shell, and it will create a new archive that's ready to rock with Python 2.6. There <em>is</em> a <code>zip</code> command that will remove these directory entries without unzipping but IIRC it behaved oddly in different shell environments or zip configurations.</p>
