<h3>Question (ID-5242933):</h3><h2>Why in python list += [elem] modifies the original list?</h2><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; list1 = []
&gt;&gt;&gt; list2 = list1
&gt;&gt;&gt; list2 += [1]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print list1
[1]
</code></pre>

<p>Comparing this to</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; list1 = []
&gt;&gt;&gt; list2 = list1
&gt;&gt;&gt; list2 = list2 + [1]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print list1
[]
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a reason why the '+='-operation modifies the original list?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT: just to make my question a bit clearer</strong></p>

<p>In most of the languages that I know the '+='-operator doesn't work this way and I would like to know why it was designed in this way in python.</p>

<p>some examples:</p>

<p>Ruby</p>

<pre><code>irb(main):001:0&gt; l = []
irb(main):002:0&gt; a = l
irb(main):003:0&gt; a += [2]
irb(main):004:0&gt; l
=&gt; []
</code></pre>

<p>Scala etc..</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Lists in Python as stored by <em>reference</em>.</p>

<p>This means that when you do <code>list2 = list1</code>, you are not making a copy of the list - you are merely saying "<code>list2</code> refers to the same thing <code>list1</code> does," namely, the list you originally created when you did <code>list1 = []</code>.</p>

<p>Python specifies <code>+=</code> to mean "append in place" for lists, because most of the time when you're using <code>+=</code> on lists, that's what you want to do - you usually don't want to create new lists every single time you add an element.</p>

<p>Thus, when you append to <code>list2</code>, which "refers to the same object <code>list1</code> does," and then read from <code>list1</code>, you see the appended item, as is expected since both of them point at the same list.</p>

<p>With <code>+</code>, however, a new list is always created because it doesn't make sense to modify either of the operands in place (since <code>a+b</code> doesn't imply the modification of <code>a</code> or <code>b</code>).</p>

<p>Therefore, when you do <code>list2 = list2 + [1]</code>, you create a new list that has all of the contents of the original object pointed to by <code>list2</code> and also <code>1</code>, and then say that <code>list2</code> now references that new list. Since it now references a different list than <code>list1</code> does, when you go to read from <code>list1</code> you still see the original list without the extra <code>1</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>From the Python 2.6.4 documentation, Section 6.2.1. (Augmented assignment statements)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An augmented assignment expression like <code>x += 1</code> can be rewritten as <code>x = x + 1</code> to achieve a similar, but not exactly equal effect. In the augmented version, x is only evaluated once. Also, when possible, <strong>the actual operation is performed in-place</strong>, meaning that rather than creating a new object and assigning that to the target, the old object is modified instead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[Emphasis added]</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>See in the <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html#object.__iadd__" rel="nofollow">documentation regarding <em>Emulating numeric types</em></a>, which describes the methods that implement this behaviour. This also applies to lists:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These methods are called to implement the augmented arithmetic assignments (<code>+=, -=, *=, /=, //=, %=, **=, &lt;&lt;=, &gt;&gt;=, &amp;=, ^=, |=</code>). <strong>These methods should attempt to do the operation in-place</strong> (modifying <code>self</code>) and return the result (which could be, but does not have to be, <code>self</code>). If a specific method is not defined, the augmented assignment falls back to the normal methods. For instance, to execute the statement <code>x += y</code>, where <code>x</code> is an instance of a class that has an <code>__iadd__()</code> method, <code>x.__iadd__(y)</code> is called. If <code>x</code> is an instance of a class that does not define a <code>__iadd__()</code> method, <code>x.__add__(y)</code> and <code>y.__radd__(x)</code> are considered, as with the evaluation of <code>x + y</code>.</p>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>When you do <code>list2 += [1]</code> you are modifying the list in place. And that is why you don't change the reference the list points to, but you are changing the list directly. When you do a <code>list2 = list2 + [1]</code>, you are creating a new list. </p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; l = []
&gt;&gt;&gt; id(l)
41523720L
&gt;&gt;&gt; l += [3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; id(l)
41523720L     # same as l = []
&gt;&gt;&gt; l = l+[3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; id(l)
41532232L
</code></pre>

<p>That explains the difference. </p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Well, because that's how it works. When you write <code>list2 = list2 + [1]</code>, you create new list and bind it to <code>list2</code> name. When you use <code>+=</code>, operation happens "in place". So when <code>list1</code> and <code>list2</code> references the same object, which is case here, you modify it with <code>+=</code> operator.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>That's how <code>+=</code> is supposed to work. In general,</p>

<pre><code>a += b
</code></pre>

<p>means</p>

<pre><code>a = a + b
</code></pre>

<p>But your particular scenario has a different problem. When you write</p>

<pre><code>list2 = list1
</code></pre>

<p>no copy is made; <code>list2</code> is now a reference to the very same list. Any modifications to <code>list2</code> will be visible in <code>list1</code> and vice versa.</p>

<p>In your second code snippet, <code>list2 + [1]</code> constructs a <em>new</em> list which is subsequently assigned to <code>list2</code>. Since this copy is independent of <code>list1</code>, no change to <code>list1</code> is visible.</p>

<p>(Nitpicker's corner: Using operator overloading, it <em>is</em> possible to construct a class that behaves differently for <code>+=</code>. Don't. Just... don't.)</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>In python, what you think of as variable names are more akin to pointers in most cases; "=" doesn't copy an object, it binds a new name to that object ("copy by reference" in other contexts). So <code>list2 = list1</code> means that both of those names point to the <em>same</em> list, not just two copies of an identical list. Hence, "+=" modifies the single list which is pointed at by both names.</p>

<p>You can copy the list element-by-element (<code>list2 = [i for in list1]</code>) or by using the <code>copy</code> module (<code>list2 = copy.copy(list1)</code>)</p>
