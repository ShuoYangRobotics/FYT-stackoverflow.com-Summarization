<h3>Question (ID-1398164):</h3><h2>Initialize a string variable in Python: "" or None?</h2><p>Suppose I have a class with a <strong>string</strong> instance attribute.
Should I initialize this attribute with <strong>""</strong> value, or <strong>None</strong> is OK either?</p>

<pre><code>def __init__(self, mystr = "")
   self.mystr = mystr
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>def __init__(self, mystr = None)
   self.mystr = mystr
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: What I thought is that if I use <strong>""</strong> as an initial value, I "<em>declare</em>" a variable to be of <strong>string</strong> type. And then I won't be able to assign any other type to it later. Am I right?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I think it's important to note here, that my suggestion was WRONG. And there is no problem to assign another type to a variable. I liked a comment of <strong>S.Lott</strong>: "<em>Since nothing in Python is "declared", you're not thinking about this the right way.</em>"</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>If not having a value has a meaning in your program (e.g. an optional value), you should use None. That's its purpose anyway. </p>

<p>If the value must be provided by the caller of __init__, I would recommend not to initialize it.</p>

<p>If "" makes sense as a default value, use it.</p>

<p>In Python the type is deduced from the usage. Hence, you can change the type by just assigning a value of another type.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = None
&gt;&gt;&gt; print type(x)
&lt;type 'NoneType'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = "text"
&gt;&gt;&gt; print type(x)
&lt;type 'str'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 42
&gt;&gt;&gt; print type(x)
&lt;type 'int'&gt;
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>It depends. If you want to distinguish between no parameter passed in at all, and an empty string passed in, you could use None.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Either is fine, though <code>None</code> is more common as a convention - <code>None</code> indicates that no value was passed for the optional parameter.</p>

<p>There <em>will</em> be times when "" is the correct default value to use - in my experience, those times occur less often.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Since both None and "" are false, you can do both. See <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#truth-value-testing" rel="nofollow">6.1. Truth Value Testing</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>To answer the question in your edit: No, you can assign a different type.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = ""
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(a)
&lt;type 'str'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(a)
&lt;type 'int'&gt;
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Either <em>might</em> be fine, but I don't think there is a definite answer.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you want to indicate that the value has not been set, comparing with <code>None</code> is better than comparing with <code>""</code>, since <code>""</code> might be a valid value,</li>
<li>If you just want a default value, <code>""</code> is probably better, because its actually a string, and you can call string methods on it. If you went with <code>None</code>, these would lead to exceptions.</li>
<li>If you wish to indicate to future maintainers that a string is required here, <code>""</code> can help with that.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Complete side note:</h3>

<p>If you have a loop, say:</p>

<pre><code>def myfunc (self, mystr = ""):
    for other in self.strs:
        mystr = self.otherfunc (mystr, other)
</code></pre>

<p>then a potential future optimizer would know that <code>str</code> is always a string. If you used <code>None</code>, then it might not be a string until the first iteration, which would require loop unrolling to get the same effects. While this isn't a hypothetical (it comes up a lot in my PHP compiler) you should certainly never write your code to take this into account. I just thought it might be interesting :)</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>For lists or dicts, the answer is more clear,
according to <a href="http://python.net/~goodger/projects/pycon/2007/idiomatic/handout.html#default-parameter-values" rel="nofollow">http://python.net/~goodger/projects/pycon/2007/idiomatic/handout.html#default-parameter-values</a>
use None as default parameter.</p>

<p>But also for strings, a (empty) string object is instanciated at runtime for
the keyword parameter.</p>

<p>The cleanest way is probably:</p>

<pre><code>def myfunc(self, my_string=None):
    self.my_string = my_string or "" # or a if-else-branch, ...
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>None is used to indicate "not set", whereas any other value is used to indicate a "default" value.</p>

<p>Hence, if your class copes with empty strings and you like it as a default value, use "". If your class needs to check if the variable was set at all, use None.</p>

<p>Notice that it doesn't matter if your variable is a string initially. You can change it to any other type/value at any other moment.</p>
