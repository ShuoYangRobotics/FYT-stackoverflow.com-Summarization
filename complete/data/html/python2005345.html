<h3>Question (ID-2005345):</h3><h2>String manipulation in Python</h2><p>I am trying to write a command but I do not want one long line that looks untidy. I am looking to add the strings together to be executed as on command. I have some code below which is part of an email function:</p>

<pre><code>msg = MIMEText("The nightly build status was a SUCCESS\n\nBuild File: http://www.python.org\n\n Build Results File: http://10.51.54.57/sandboxes/", project, "\n")
</code></pre>

<p>This shows the one line, I am hoping for a better way to do this. I have tried the below code but it does not work.</p>

<pre><code>msg = MIMEText("The nightly build status was a SUCCESS\n\nBuild File: ")
msg += MIMEText("http://www.python.org\n\n Build Results File: ")
msg += MIMEText("http://10.51.54.57/sandboxes/", project, "\n")
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks for any help.</p>

<p>I have tried the below code but get:</p>

<pre><code>msg = MIMEText("""The nightly build status was a SUCCESS\n\n
   Build File: """,  
   build_file, """
   \n\n 
   Build Results File: """, 
   build_file, """
   \n\n
   Sandbox Folder:""", 
   sandbox, """ 
   \n\n
   Antibrick File: """,
   antibrick, "\n\n")
</code></pre>

<p>Now I get the message:</p>

<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test_email.py", line 45, in &lt;module&gt;
    if __name__ == '__main__': myObject = email_success()
  File "test_email.py", line 32, in email_success
    antibrick, "\n\n")
TypeError: __init__() takes at most 4 arguments (10 given)
</code></pre>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Thanks S.Mark, I tried this but when the email is sent it is not as a hyperlink but sent as:</p>

<pre><code>The nightly build status was a SUCCESS


Build File: ('http://10.67.54.57/sandboxes/', '2010-01-05/new_sandbox', 'basebuild') 



Build Results File: ('http://10.67.54.57/sandboxes/', '2010-01-05/new_sandbox', 'basebuild') 



Sandbox Folder: ('http://10.67.54.57/sandboxes/', '2010-01-05/new_sandbox')

<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Try:</p>

<pre><code>msg = MIMEText("""The nightly build status was a SUCCESS

Build File:
http://www.python.org

Build Results File: 
http://10.51.54.57/sandboxes/""", project, "\n")
</code></pre>

<p>If the additional space at the beginning of each line is a problem, remove them with a regexp (<code>r'^\s+'</code>)</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>How about</p>

<pre><code>msg = MIMEText(
"The nightly build status was a SUCCESS\n\n"
"Build File: http://www.python.org\n\n"
"Build Results File: http://10.51.54.57/sandboxes/"
, project
, "\n"
)
</code></pre>

<p>Or</p>

<pre><code>msg = MIMEText("""The nightly build status was a SUCCESS

Build File: http://www.python.org

Build Results File: http://10.51.54.57/sandboxes/""", project, "\n")
</code></pre>

<p>Or</p>

<pre><code>msg = MIMEText("The nightly build status was a SUCCESS\n\n"
"Build File: http://www.python.org\n\n"
"Build Results File: http://10.51.54.57/sandboxes/"
, project, "\n")
</code></pre>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: because OP added another question</p>

<pre><code>msg=MIMEText("""The nightly build status was a SUCCESS\n\n
    Build File: %s
    \n\n 
    Build Results File: %s
    \n\n
    Sandbox Folder: %s 
    \n\n
    Antibrick File: """ % (build_file,build_file,sandbox),
    antibrick, 
    "\n\n"
)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Why not</p>

<pre><code>msg= MIMEText("The nightly build status was a SUCCESS\n\nBuild File: "+ \
  "http://www.python.org\n\n Bu..... ") 
</code></pre>

<p>etc.</p>

<p>(I.e., use the line continuation backslash).</p>

<p>Also note  that the following each give you <em>abcdef</em></p>

<pre><code>s ="abc" "def"

s= "abc" \
     "def"
</code></pre>

<p>Also, </p>

<pre><code> s="""xyz
    wvu"""
</code></pre>

<p>gives you </p>

<pre><code>'xyz\nwvu'
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Python supports multi-line strings using triple quotes:</p>

<pre><code>text = """The nightly build status was a SUCCESS\n\nBuild File: 
http://www.python.org\n\n Build Results File: 
http://10.51.54.57/sandboxes/"""
msg = MIMEText(text, project, "\n")
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>you can use triple quotes</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s="""The nightly build status was a SUCCESS

Build File: http://www.python.org

Build Results File: http://10.51.54.57/sandboxes/"""

&gt;&gt;&gt; msg=MimeType(s,project,"\n")

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Hmm, what exactly is the module are you using? I am guessing, that it is deprecated, because the modern interface is <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/email.html" rel="nofollow">email</a> (if I've guessed your intentions correctly). More specifically, to create a <code>MIMEText</code> object you use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/email.mime.html#email.mime.text.MIMEText" rel="nofollow">this class</a>. The signature is </p>

<pre><code>email.mime.text.MIMEText(_text[, _subtype[, _charset]])
