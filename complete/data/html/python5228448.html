<h3>Question (ID-5228448):</h3><h2>How do I match a word in a text file using python?</h2><p>I want to search and match a particular word in a text file.</p>

<pre><code>with open('wordlist.txt', 'r') as searchfile:
        for line in searchfile:
            if word in line:
                    print line
</code></pre>

<p>This code returns even the words that contain substrings of the target word. For example if the word is "there" then the search returns "there", "therefore", "thereby", etc.</p>

<p>I want the code to return only the lines which contain "there". Period.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>split the line into tokens: <code>if word in line.split():</code></p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><pre><code>import re

file = open('wordlist.txt', 'r')

for line in file.readlines():
    if re.search('^there$', line, re.I):
        print line
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>re.search</code> function scans the string <code>line</code> and returns true if it finds the regular expression defined in the first parameter, ignoring case with <code>re.I</code>. The <code>^</code> character means 'beginning of the line' while the <code>$</code> character means 'end of the line'. Therefore, the search function will only return true if it matches <em>there</em> preceded by the beginning of the line, and followed by the end of the line, aka isolated on its own.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You ought to use a regular expression. The <a href="http://docs.python.org/howto/regex.html" rel="nofollow">regular expression howto</a> from the Python docs might be a good place to start.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Look up the re module (regular expressions).  re.search with the regex ' there ' is what you want.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You can always use regex, something along the lines of:</p>

<pre><code>import re

with open('wordlist.txt', 'r') as searchfile:
        for line in searchfile:
            if re.search( r'\sthere\s', line, re.M|re.I):
                    print line
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><code>\sthere\s</code> - any space followed by 'there' followed by any space</li>
<li><code>re.I</code> - means case insensitive</li>
<li><code>re.M</code> - doesn't really matter in this case (since lines only have 1 \n)</li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Without <code>re</code> module:</p>

<pre><code>specialWord = "Maciej"
with open('wordlist.txt', 'r') as searchfile:
    for line in searchfile:
        lineL = line.split()
        for word in lineL:
            if word == specialWord:
                print line,
</code></pre>
