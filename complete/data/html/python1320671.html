<h3>Question (ID-1320671):</h3><h2>How to encrypt a string using the key</h2><p>I have a 'public key' in a variable named varkey, for gettting the public key i used the urllib and stored that public key in a variable now i want to encrypt a msg/string using the public key .</p>

<p>its ok if somebody guide me for any API library</p>

<p>Thanks </p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>My blog post (the passingcuriosity.com link in John Boker's answer) does AES -- a symmetric encryption algorithm -- using the M2Crypto library. M2Crypto is a Python wrapper around OpenSSL. The API is pretty much a straight translation of OpenSSL's into Python, so the somewhat sketchy documentation shouldn't be too much of a problem. If the public key encryption algorithm you need to use is supported by M2Crypto, then you could very well use it to do your public key cryptography.</p>

<p>I found the <a href="http://svn.osafoundation.org/m2crypto/trunk/tests/">M2Crypto test suite</a> to be a useful example of using its API. In particular, the RSA (in test_rsa.py), PGP (in test_pgp.py), and EVP (in test_evp.py) tests will help you figure out how to set up and use the library. Do be aware that they are unit-tests, so it can be a little tricky to figure out exactly what code is necessary and what is an artefact of being a test.</p>

<p>PS: As I'm new, my posts can only contain one link so I had to delete most of them. Sorry.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<pre><code>from M2Crypto import RSA

rsa = RSA.load_pub_key('rsa.pub.pem')
encrypted = rsa.public_encrypt('your message', RSA.pkcs1_oaep_padding)
print encrypted.encode('base64')
</code></pre>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>From my recent python experience, python doesn't do encryption natively.  You need to use an external (3rd party) package.  Each of these, obviously, offers a different experience.  Which are you using?  This will probably determine how your syntax will vary.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Very funny. Have you ever heard about "RSAError: data too large for key size" ? No???? Try your sample with more long message:</p>

<pre><code>encrypted = rsa.public_encrypt('My blog post (the passingcuriosity.com link in John Boker's answer) does AES -- a symmetric encryption algorithm -- using the M2Crypto library', RSA.pkcs1_oaep_padding)
</code></pre>

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You could use MD5 or SHA1 hashing along with your key...</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Here's the script that demonstrates how to encrypt a message using M2Crypto (<code>$ easy_install m2crypto</code>) given that public key is in <code>varkey</code> variable:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
import urllib2
from M2Crypto import BIO, RSA

def readkey(filename):
    try:
        key = open(filename).read()
    except IOError:
        key = urllib2.urlopen(
            'http://svn.osafoundation.org/m2crypto/trunk/tests/' + filename
            ).read()
        open(filename, 'w').write(key)
    return key

def test():
    message = 'disregard the -man- (I mean file) behind curtain'
    varkey = readkey('rsa.pub.pem')
    # demonstrate how to load key from a string
    bio = BIO.MemoryBuffer(varkey)
    rsa = RSA.load_pub_key_bio(bio)
    # encrypt
    encrypted = rsa.public_encrypt(message, RSA.pkcs1_oaep_padding)
    print encrypted.encode('base64')
    del rsa, bio    
    # decrypt
    read_password = lambda *args: 'qwerty'
    rsa = RSA.load_key_string(readkey('rsa.priv2.pem'), read_password)
    decrypted = rsa.private_decrypt(encrypted, RSA.pkcs1_oaep_padding)
    print decrypted
    assert message == decrypted

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test()
