<h3>Question (ID-132988):</h3><h2>Is there a difference between `==` and `is` in python?</h2><p>My Google-fu has failed me.</p>

<p>In Python, are these:</p>

<pre><code>n = 5
# Test one.
if n == 5:
    print 'Yay!'

# Test two.
if n is 5:
    print 'Yay!'
</code></pre>

<p>two tests for equality equivalent (ha!)? Does this hold true for objects where you would be comparing instances (a <code>list</code> say)?</p>

<p>Okay, so this kind of answers my question:</p>

<pre><code>l = list()
l.append(1)
if l == [1]:
    print 'Yay!'
# Holds true, but...

if l is [1]:
    print 'Yay!'
# Doesn't.
</code></pre>

<p>So <code>==</code> tests value where <code>is</code> tests to see if they are the same object?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-12):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p><code>is</code> will return <code>True</code> if two variables point to the same object, <code>==</code> if the objects referred to by the variables are equal.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = a
&gt;&gt;&gt; b is a 
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; b == a
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = a[:]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b is a
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; b == a
True
</code></pre>

<p>In your case, the second test only works because Python caches small integer objects, which is an implementation detail. For larger integers, this does not work:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 1000 is 10**3
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1000 == 10**3
True
</code></pre>

<p>The same holds true for string literals:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; "a" is "a"
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; "aa" is "a" * 2
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = "a"
&gt;&gt;&gt; "aa" is x * 2
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; "aa" is intern(x*2)
True
</code></pre>

<p>Please see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26595/is-there-any-difference-between-foo-is-none-and-foo-none">this question</a> as well.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>There is a simple rule of thumb to tell you when to use <code>==</code> or <code>is</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>==</code> is for <em>value equality</em>. Use it when you would like to know if two objects have the same value.</li>
<li><code>is</code> is for <em>reference equality</em>. Use it when you would like to know if two references refer to the same object.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, when you are comparing something to a simple type, you are usually checking for <em>value equality</em>, so you should use <code>==</code>. For example, the intention of your example is probably to check whether x has a value equal to 2 (<code>==</code>), not whether <code>x</code> is literally referring to the same object as 2.</p>

<hr>

<p>Something else to note: because of the way the CPython reference implementation works, you'll get unexpected and inconsistent results if you mistakenly use <code>is</code> to compare for reference equality on integers:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 500
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = 500
&gt;&gt;&gt; a == b
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; a is b
False
</code></pre>

<p>That's pretty much what we expected: <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> have the same value, but are distinct entities. But what about this?</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; c = 200
&gt;&gt;&gt; d = 200
&gt;&gt;&gt; c == d
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; c is d
True
</code></pre>

<p>This is inconsistent with the earlier result. What's going on here? It turns out the reference implementation of Python caches integer objects in the range -5..256 as singleton instances for performance reasons. Here's an example demonstrating this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(250, 260): a = i; print "%i: %s" % (i, a is int(str(i)));
... 
250: True
251: True
252: True
253: True
254: True
255: True
256: True
257: False
258: False
259: False
</code></pre>

<p>This is another obvious reason not to use <code>is</code>: the behavior is left up to implementations when you're erroneously using it for value equality.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>== determines if the values are equivalent, while "is" determines if they are the exact same object. </p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Note that this is why <code>if foo is None:</code> is the preferred null comparison for python. All null objects are really pointers to the same value, which python sets aside to mean "None"</p>

<p><code>if x is True:</code> and <code>if x is False:</code> also work in a similar manner. False and True are two special objects, all true boolean values are True and all false boolean values are False </p>

<p>is tests for identity
== tests for equality</p>

<p>Each (small) integer value is mapped to a single value, so every 3 is identical and equal. This is an implementation detail, not part of the language spec though</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Your answer is correct. The <code>is</code> operator compares the identity of two objects.  The <code>==</code> operator compares the values of two objects.</p>

<p>An object's identity never changes once it has been created; you may think of it as the object's address in memory.</p>

<p>You can control comparison behaviour of object values by defining a <code>__cmp__</code> method or a <a href="http://docs.python.org/ref/customization.html" rel="nofollow">rich comparison</a> method like <code>__eq__</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I believe this similar question might answer your question; <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/132988/is-there-a-difference-between-and-is-in-python">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/132988/is-there-a-difference-between-and-is-in-python</a></p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>They are <b>completely different</b>.  <code>is</code> checks for object identity, while <code>==</code> checks for equality (a notion that depends on the two operands' types).</p>

<p>It is only a lucky coincidence that "<code>is</code>" seems to work correctly with small integers (e.g. 5 == 4+1).  That is because CPython optimizes the storage of integers in the range (-5 to 256) by making them singletons: <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.5/api/intObjects.html#l2h-381" rel="nofollow">http://www.python.org/doc/2.5/api/intObjects.html#l2h-381</a></p>

<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>have a look at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/306313/python-is-operator-behaves-unexpectedly-with-integers">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/306313/python-is-operator-behaves-unexpectedly-with-integers</a></p>

<p>what it mostly boils down to is that "<code>is</code>" checks to see if they are the same object, not just equal to each other (the numbers &lt;256 are a special case)</p>
<br /><b>#10</b><br /><p>As John Feminella said, most of the time you will use == and != because your objective is to  compare values. I'd just like to categorise what you would do the rest of the time:</p>

<p>There is one and only one instance of NoneType i.e. None is a singleton. Consequently <code>foo == None</code> and <code>foo is None</code> mean the same. However the <code>is</code> test is faster and the Pythonic convention is to use <code>foo is None</code>.</p>

<p>If you are doing some introspection or mucking about with garbage collection or checking whether your custom-built string interning gadget is working or suchlike, then you probably have a use-case for <code>foo</code> is <code>bar</code>.</p>

<p>True and False are also (now) singletons, but there is no use-case for <code>foo == True</code> and no use case for <code>foo is True</code>. </p>
<br /><b>#11</b><br /><p>@Ryan, @John Machin: "foo is None , foo is True, foo is False" maybe faster and even popular idioms, but I would never rely on such a hidden implementation detail such as singletons/value caching.
This is a useful optimization though, but binding your code to it can be a pain when using a language implementation that does not have the same implementation detail, and that could be reasonably possible.
Torsten and John Fermilla pointed to this detail as a CPython detail indeed.</p>

<p>@John Machin: "Consequently foo == None and foo is None mean the same." : I would have said "they mean different but they behave the same".
As you know a computer is very "pedantic" so I would say precise wording can be a proper attribute of a programmer. Please take this has an hint, as I would, and not "personally".</p>
