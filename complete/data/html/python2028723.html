<h3>Question (ID-2028723):</h3><h2>Python data structures, dictionary?</h2><p>I hope somebody can help. I am using Python and I would like to be able to do the following.</p>

<p>I have a set of objects (shapes for example) and a series of commands to act on these objects. The commands have the a format of a command string followed by a variable number of parameters which can be strings or integers</p>

<p>For example the shape 'Rectangle' may have the following commands<br>
'ChangeColor' 'green'<br>
'FillStyle' 'hatch'<br>
'Dimensions' 10 15<br>
etc..... </p>

<p>What would be the best data structure to store this information. I need to be able to easily retrieve these commands from the data structure given the 'shape' of the object. Would a dictionary be the correct choice, I have never used these before</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<pre><code>class Shape(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.shape = "rectangle"
        self.color = "green"
        self.fillstyle = "hatch"
        # etc

    def ChangeColor(self, color):
        self.color = color

    # etc
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><code>dicts</code> are for when the order isn't important but you want store values for different names.</p>

<p><code>lists</code> are ordered sequences of objects, usually of the same type and the position doesn't mean anything particular.</p>

<p><code>tuples</code> are ordered sequences of objects, possibly of different types and each different position has a specific meaning.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I would suggest using an object class and storing all of the values/commands within that object so that you can pass it around easily. (Similar to what <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/44743/recursive">recursive</a> said). </p>

<p>However; you could also use a dictionary with the key being the object name and the values being a list containing possible commands. </p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>It seems to me that a command could be represented as a list <code>[]</code> or tuple <code>()</code>, and so could a series of commands.  So one possibility is that you have a list of lists of strings.  Generally you want to use a dictionary only when you want to look up a value by key.  For example, if you knew the name of a command (wrt a shape) and wanted to know which parameters were passed to that command, you could have a dictionary mapping from string to list.</p>

<p>If you post more about how you plan to use this data, I could give a better answer.</p>

<p>Here is a link to the Python documentation on basic data structures, which should be very helpful:  <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/tutorial/datastructures.html</a></p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: in response to first comment, do you need to store the commands or just read them from input one by one and execute them?</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>What about this?</p>

<h1>Example</h1>

<pre><code>s = {'Rectangle':
        {'ChangeColor':'green','FillStyle':'hatch',
         'Dimension1': 10, 'Dimension2':15}}
s['Triangle'] = {'ChangeColor':'red','FillStyle':'hatch',
         'Dimension1': 10, 'Dimension2':15, 'Dimension3':5}

for k, v in s.iteritems():
    print k
    for k1, v1 in v.iteritems():
        print "   ", k1, "=", v1
</code></pre>

<p>Result:</p>

<pre><code>Triangle
    Dimension1 = 10
    Dimension2 = 15
    Dimension3 = 5
    ChangeColor = red
    FillStyle = hatch
Rectangle
    Dimension1 = 10
    Dimension2 = 15
    ChangeColor = green
    FillStyle = hatch
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I would store the commands as a list of lists, or of tuples, depending on whether or not I thought I'd modify commands.  Note that argument unpacking in Python makes for a very simple mechanism for executing these commands, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>class Shape(object):
    def background(self, color):
        print "background:", color
    def foreground(self, color):
        print "foreground:", color
    def rect(self, left, top, right, bottom):
        print "rect:", left, top, right, bottom
    def execute_commands(self, command_list):
        for command in command_list:
            if hasattr(self, command[0]):
                getattr(self, command[0])(*command[1:])

&gt;&gt;&gt; s = Shape()
&gt;&gt;&gt; c = [('background', 'blue'), ('foreground', 'yellow'), ('rect', 10, 0, 20, 20)]
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.execute_commands(c)
background: blue
foreground: yellow
rect: 10 0 20 20
</code></pre>
