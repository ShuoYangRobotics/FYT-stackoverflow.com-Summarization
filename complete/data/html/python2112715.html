<h3>Question (ID-2112715):</h3><h2>How do I fix PyDev "Undefined variable from import" errors?</h2><p>I've got a Python project using PyDev in Eclipse, and PyDev keeps generating false errors for my code.  I have a module <code>settings</code> that defines a <code>settings</code> object.  I import that in module <code>b</code> and assign an attribute with:</p>

<pre><code>from settings import settings
settings.main = object()
</code></pre>

<p>In some of my code--but not all of it, statements like:</p>

<pre><code>from settings import settings
print settings.main 
</code></pre>

<p>... generate "Undefined variable from import: main" messages in the Eclipse code error pane, even though the code runs without a problem.  How can I correct these?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>For code in your project, the only way is adding a comment saying that you expected that (the static code-analysis only sees what you see, not runtime info -- if you opened that module yourself, you'd have no indication that main was expected).</p>

<p>You can use ctrl+1 in a line with an error and pydev will present you an option to add a comment to ignore that error.</p>

<p>If it was some external module, you could add it to the forced builtins so that it was forced to be analyzed by a running shell with runtime information (see <a href="http://pydev.org/manual_101_interpreter.html" rel="nofollow">http://pydev.org/manual_101_interpreter.html</a> for details).</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I'm using opencv which relies on binaries etc so I have scripts where every other line has this silly error. Python is a dynamic language so such occasions shouldn't be considered errors.</p>

<p>I removed these errors altogether by going to:</p>

<p>Window -> Preferences -> PyDev -> Editor -> Code Analysis -> Undefined -> Undefined Variable From Import -> Ignore</p>

<p>And that's that.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>It is possible you just need to re-configure your python path within Eclipse.  See my <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2143549/undefined-variable-from-import-when-using-wxpython-in-pydev/3743861#3743861">answer</a> to a similar question.  </p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I had the same problem. I am using Python and Eclipse on Windows. The code was running just fine, but eclipse show errors everywhere. After I changed the name of the folder 'Lib' to 'lib' (C:\Python27\lib), the problem was solved. It seems that if the capitalization of the letters doesn't match the one in the configuration file, this will sometimes cause problems (but it seems like not always, because the error checking was fine for long time before the problems suddenly appeared for no obvious reason). </p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I was having a similar problem with an Eclipse/PyDev project. In this project the root directory of the python code was a sub-directory of the project.</p>

<pre><code>--&gt; MyProject
 + --&gt; src         Root of python code
   + --&gt; module1     A module 
   + --&gt; module2     Another module
 + --&gt; docs
 + --&gt; test
</code></pre>

<p>When the project was debugged or run everything was fine as the working directory was set to the correct place. However the PyDev code analysis was failing to find any imports from module1 or module2.</p>

<p>Solution was to edit the project properties -> PyDev - PYTHONPATH section and remove /MyProject from the source folders tab and add /MyProject/src to it instead.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>define main in the module? It seems like the error message clear, and you have code that fixes it, so why the question?</p>

<p>Your code isn't generating false errors, main is most likely not getting defined. perhaps if you post some code from your settings module, someone can give you a better answer.</p>
