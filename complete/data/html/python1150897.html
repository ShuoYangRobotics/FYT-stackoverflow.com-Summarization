<h3>Question (ID-1150897):</h3><h2>Emulate processing with python?</h2><p>I'm looking for a basic programmatic animation framework similar to processing except in python. That is, something that allows pixel manipulation, has basic drawing/color primitives, and is geared towards animation. Is pygame pretty much the best bet or are there other options?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>"Similar to processing except in python" screams "NodeBox" to me. NodeBox is OSX-only, and i don't know if it allows pixel-level manipulation, but much of its command set was derived directly from processing. You can find it at <a href="http://nodebox.net/" rel="nofollow">the NodeBox site</a>.</p>

<p>Someone's already mentioned Shoebot, which is probably the closest in spirit to Processing:</p>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You could get pretty close to processing with vpython:</p>

<p>The primitives are very easy to work with, and it is adept at animation. </p>

<p>I am not sure what kind of pixel manipulation you are looking for, but there may be something for that as well.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>There's quite recent C++ library, <a href="http://www.sfml-dev.org/" rel="nofollow">SFML</a>, which is a good alternative to SDL.
Thus its Python bindings should be a good alternative to Pygame.</p>
