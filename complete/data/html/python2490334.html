<h3>Question (ID-2490334):</h3><h2>Simple way to encode a string according to a password?</h2><p>Does Python have a built-in, simple way of encoding/decoding strings using a password?</p>

<p>Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; encode('John Doe', password = 'mypass')
'sjkl28cn2sx0'
&gt;&gt;&gt; decode('sjkl28cn2sx0', password = 'mypass')
'John Doe'
</code></pre>

<p>So the string "John Doe" gets encrypted as 'sjkl28cn2sx0'. To get the original string, I would "unlock" that string with the key 'mypass', which is a password in my source code. I'd like this to be the way I can encrypt/decrypt a Word document with a password.</p>

<p>I would like to use these encrypted strings as URL parameters. My goal is obfuscation, not strong security; nothing mission critical is being encoded. I realize I could use a database table to store keys and values, but am trying to be minimalist.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>As you explicitly state that you want obscurity not security, we'll avoid reprimanding you for the weakness of what you suggest :)</p>

<p>So, using PyCrypto:</p>

<pre><code>from Crypto.Cipher import AES
import base64

cipher = AES.new(secret_key,AES.MODE_ECB) # never use ECB in strong systems obviously
encoded = base64.b64encode(cipher.encrypt(msg_text))
# ...
decoded = cipher.decrypt(baes64.b64decode(msg_text))
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Assuming you are <em>only</em> looking for simple obfuscation that will obscure things from the <em>very</em> casual observer, and you aren't looking to use third party libraries. I'd recommend something like the Vigenere cipher. It is one of the strongest of the simple ancient ciphers.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher</a></p>

<p>It's quick and easy to implement. Something like:</p>

<pre><code>def encode(key, string):
    encoded_chars = []
    for i in xrange(string):
        key_c = key[i % len(key)]
        encoded_c = chr(ord(string[i]) + ord(encoded_c) % 256)
        encoded_chars.append(encoded_c)
    encoded_string = "".join(encoded_chars)
    return base64.urlsafe_b64encode(encoded_string)
</code></pre>

<p>Decode is pretty much the same, except you subtract the key.</p>

<p>It is much harder to break if the strings you are encoding are short, and/or if it is hard to guess the length of the passphrase used. </p>

<p>If you are looking for something cryptographic, PyCrypto is probably your best bet, though previous answers overlook some details: ECB mode in PyCyrpto requires your message to be a multiple of 16 characters in length. So, you must pad. Also, if you want to use them as URL parameters, use base64.urlsafe_b64_encode(), rather than the standard one. This replaces a few of the characters in the base64 alphabet with URL-safe ones (as it's name suggests).</p>

<p>However, you should be ABSOLUTELY certain that this <em>very</em> thin layer of obfuscation suffices for your needs before using this. The Wikipedia article I linked to provides detailed instructions for breaking the cipher, so anyone with a moderate amount of determination could easily break it.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Simple way is using the library, and <a href="http://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/" rel="nofollow">PyCrypto</a> is the good one.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p><strike>If you are using passwords, it's best to do it right (especially if you are dealing with user passwords).</p>

<p>What you want to do is "encrypt" the password, not encode.</p>

<p>You have two choices on how you can do this, depending on who is doign the encrypting.</p>

<p>If its a trusted thirdparty, use Public/Private key encryption. RSA is a good choice. You give the public key to your trusted thirdparty, and keep the private key safe.</p>

<p>If you're doing the encrypting yourself, and noone will have access to your code, then Symmetric key encryption is good. I recommend AES with a sufficiently strong key (256bit).</p>

<p>There are libraries for python that do either of these encryption schemes.</p>

<p>You can 1/2 ass security, but don't. It's not a good idea. Ever.</strike></p>

<p>You can use AES to encrypt your string with a password. Though, you'll want to chose a strong enough password so people can't easily guess what it is (sorry I can't help it. I'm a wannabe security weenie).</p>

<p>AES is strong with a good key size, but it's also easy to use with PyCrypto.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>External libraries provide secret-key encryption algorithms.</p>

<p>For example, the <a href="http://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/apidoc/Crypto.Cipher-module.html" rel="nofollow"><code>Cypher</code> module in PyCrypto</a> offers a selection of many encryption algorithms:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Crypto.Cipher.AES</code></li>
<li><code>Crypto.Cipher.ARC2</code></li>
<li><code>Crypto.Cipher.ARC4</code></li>
<li><code>Crypto.Cipher.Blowfish</code></li>
<li><code>Crypto.Cipher.CAST</code></li>
<li><code>Crypto.Cipher.DES</code></li>
<li><code>Crypto.Cipher.DES3</code></li>
<li><code>Crypto.Cipher.IDEA</code></li>
<li><code>Crypto.Cipher.RC5</code></li>
<li><code>Crypto.Cipher.XOR</code></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://chandlerproject.org/Projects/MeTooCrypto" rel="nofollow">MeTooCrypto</a> is a <code>Python</code> wrapper for <a href="http://www.openssl.org/" rel="nofollow">OpenSSL</a>, and provides (among other functions) a full-strength general purpose cryptography library. Included are symmetric ciphers (like AES).</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>This works but password length should be exactly <code>8</code>. This is simple and requires <a href="http://twhiteman.netfirms.com/des.html" rel="nofollow">pyDes</a>.</p>

<pre><code>from pyDes import *

def encode(data,password):
    k = des(password, CBC, "\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0", pad=None, padmode=PAD_PKCS5)
    d = k.encrypt(data)
    return d

def decode(data,password):
    k = des(password, CBC, "\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0", pad=None, padmode=PAD_PKCS5)
    d = k.decrypt(data)
    return d

x = encode('John Doe', 'mypass12')
y = decode(x,'mypass12')

print x
print y
</code></pre>

<p>OUTPUT:</p>
