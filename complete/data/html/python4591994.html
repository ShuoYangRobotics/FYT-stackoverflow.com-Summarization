<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li><p>Where is Python used?</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>The Google build system is written in python.  All of Google's
  corporate code is checked into a
  repository and the dependency and
  building of this code is managed by
  python.  Greg mentioned that to create
  code.google.com took about 100 lines
  of python code.  But since it has so
  many dependencies, the build system
  generated a 3 megabyte makefile for
  it!</li>
  <li>Packaging.  Google has an internal packaging format like RPM. 
  These packages are created using
  python.</li>
  <li>Binary Data Pusher.  This is the area where Alex Martelli is working,
  on optimizing pushing bits between
  thousands of servers</li>
  <li>Production servers.  All monitoring, restarting and data
  collection functionality is done with
  python</li>
  <li>Reporting.  Logs are analyzed and reports are generated using
  Python.</li>
  <li>A few services including code.google.com and google groups. 
  Most other front ends are in C++
  (google.com) and Java (gmail).  All
  web services are built on top of a
  highly optimizing http server wrapped
  with SWIG.</li>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I can tell you that Facebook uses PHP as a frontend presentation layer and backend is mostly MySQL and (for message search) Cassandra.</p>

<p>Google uses BigTable for backend repository (I don't know if they use MySQL or other technologies).</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Google makes use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce" rel="nofollow">Map Reduce</a> to process huge amount of data.<a href="http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=16121578919" rel="nofollow">Facebook</a> uses an open source implementation of Map Reduce called <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/" rel="nofollow">Hadoop</a>. </p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Heard a rumor that Facebook uses Erlang for its messaging system:

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Google tree whales: <a href="http://labs.google.com/papers/gfs.html" rel="nofollow">Google File System</a>, <a href="http://labs.google.com/papers/bigtable.html" rel="nofollow">BigTable</a> and <a href="http://labs.google.com/papers/mapreduce.html" rel="nofollow">MapReduce</a></p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Since you are asking about both front-end and back-end, you maybe interested in the part inbetween: How they communicate between different systems.</p>

<p>For this Google and Facebook use <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/protocolbuffers/" rel="nofollow">Protocol Buffers</a> and <a href="http://thrift.apache.org/" rel="nofollow">Thrift</a> respectively.</p>
