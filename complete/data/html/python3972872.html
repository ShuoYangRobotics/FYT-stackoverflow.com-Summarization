<h3>Question (ID-3972872):</h3><h2>Python variables as keys to dict</h2><p>Is there an easier way to do this in Python (2.7)?: Note: This isn't anything fancy, like putting all local variables into a dictionary. Just the ones I specify in a list.</p>

<pre><code>apple = 1
banana = 'f'
carrot = 3
fruitdict = {}

# I want to set the key equal to variable name, and value equal to variable value
# is there a more Pythonic way to get {'apple': 1, 'banana': 'f', 'carrot': 3}?

for x in [apple, banana, carrot]:
    fruitdict[x] = x # (Won't work)
</code></pre>

<p>Edit: the number assignments were meaningless...changing them.</p>

</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#globals" rel="nofollow"><code>globals()</code></a> function returns a dictionary containing all your global variables.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; apple = 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; banana = 'f'
&gt;&gt;&gt; carrot = 3
&gt;&gt;&gt; globals()
{'carrot': 3, 'apple': 1, '__builtins__': &lt;module '__builtin__' (built-in)&gt;, '__name__': '__main__', '__doc__': None, 'banana': 'f'}
</code></pre>

<p>There is also a similar function called <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#locals" rel="nofollow"><code>locals()</code></a>.</p>

<p>I realise this is probably not exactly what you want, but it may provide some insight into how Python provides access to your variables.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: It sounds like your problem may be better solved by simply using a dictionary in the first place:</p>

<pre><code>fruitdict = {}
fruitdict['apple'] = 1
fruitdict['banana'] = 'f'
fruitdict['carrot'] = 3
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>locals() and globals()?</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>A one-liner is:-</p>

<pre><code>fruitdict = dict(zip(('apple','banana','carrot'), (1,'f', '3'))
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>If you want to bind the locations of the variables themselves, there's this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; apple = 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; banana = 'f'
&gt;&gt;&gt; carrot = 3
&gt;&gt;&gt; fruitdict = {}
&gt;&gt;&gt; fruitdict['apple'] = lambda : apple
&gt;&gt;&gt; fruitdict['banana'] = lambda : banana
&gt;&gt;&gt; fruitdict['carrot'] = lambda : carrot
&gt;&gt;&gt; for k in fruitdict.keys():
...     print k, fruitdict[k]()
... 
carrot 3
apple 1
banana f
&gt;&gt;&gt; apple = 7
&gt;&gt;&gt; for k in fruitdict.keys():
...     print k, fruitdict[k]()
... 
carrot 3
apple 7
banana f
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>why you don't do the opposite :</p>

<pre><code>fruitdict = { 
      'apple':1,
      'banana':'f',
      'carrot':3,
}

locals().update(fruitdict)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update :</strong></p>

<p>don't use the code above check the comment.</p>

<p>by the way why you don't mark the vars that you want to get i don't know 
maybe like this:</p>

<pre><code># All the vars that i want to get are followed by _fruit
apple_fruit = 1
carrot_fruit = 'f'

for var in locals():
    if var.endswith('fruit'):
       you_dict.update({var:locals()[var])
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Well this is a bit, umm ... non-Pythonic ... ugly ... hackish ... </p>

<p>Here's a snippet of code assuming you want to create a dictionary of all the local variables you
create after a specific checkpoint is taken:</p>

<pre><code>checkpoint = [ 'checkpoint' ] + locals().keys()[:]
## Various local assigments here ...
var_keys_since_checkpoint = set(locals().keys()) - set(checkpoint)
new_vars = dict()
for each in var_keys_since_checkpoint:
   new_vars[each] = locals()[each]
</code></pre>

<p>Note that we explicitly add the 'checkpoint' key into our capture of the <code>locals().keys()</code>  I'm also explicitly taking a slice of that though it shouldn't be necessary in this case since the reference has to be flattened to add it to the [ 'checkpoint' ] list.  However, if you were using a variant of this code and tried to shortcut out the <code>['checkpoint'] + portion (because that key was already in</code>locals()<code>, for example) ... then, without the [:] slice you could end up with a reference to the</code>locals().keys()` whose values would change as you added variables.</p>

<p>Offhand I can't think of a way to call something like <code>new_vars.update()</code> with a list of keys to be added/updated.  So the<code>for</code> loop is most portable.  I suppose a dictionary comprehension could be used in more recent versions of Python.  However that woudl seem to be nothing more than a round of code golf.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>This question has practically been answered, but I just wanted to say it was funny that you said</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This isn't anything fancy, like
  putting all local variables into a
  dictionary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because it is actually "fancier"</p>

<p>what you want is:</p>

<pre><code>apple = 1
banana = 'f'
carrot = 3
fruitdict = {}

# I want to set the key equal to variable name, and value equal to variable value
# is there a more Pythonic way to get {'apple': 1, 'banana': 'f', 'carrot': 3}?

names= 'apple banana carrot'.split() # I'm just being lazy for this post
items = globals()                    # or locals()

for name in names:
    fruitdict[name] = items[name]
</code></pre>

<p>Honestly, what you are doing is just copying items from one dictionary to another.</p>

<p>(Greg Hewgill practically gave the whole answer, I just made it complete)</p>

<p>...and like people suggested, you should probably be putting these in the dictionary in the first place, but I'll assume that for some reason you can't</p>
