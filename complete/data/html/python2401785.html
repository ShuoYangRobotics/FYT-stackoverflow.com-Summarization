<h3>Question (ID-2401785):</h3><h2>In Python, can I single line a for loop over iterator with an IF filter?</h2><p>Silly question:<br>
I have a simple for loop followed by a simple if statement:  </p>

<pre><code>for airport in airports:
    if airport.is_important:
</code></pre>

<p>and I was wondering if I can write this as a single line somehow.<br>
So, yes, I can do this:  </p>

<pre><code>for airport in (airport for airport in airports if airport.is_important):
</code></pre>

<p>but it reads so silly and redundant ("for airport in airport for airport in airports...").<br>
Is there a better way?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>No, there is no shorter way. Usually, you will even break it into two lines :</p>

<pre><code>important_airports = (airport for airport in airports if airport.is_important)
for airport in important_airports:
    # do stuff
</code></pre>

<p>This is more flexible, easier to read and still don't consume much memory.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Mabe this, but it's more or less the same verbose...</p>

<pre><code>import itertools

for airport in itertools.ifilter(lambda x: x.is_important, airports):
    ...
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You could do</p>

<pre><code>for airport in filter(lamdba x: x.is_important, airports):
    # do stuff...
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I'd use a negative guard on the loop. It's readable, and doesn't introduce an extra level of indentation.</p>

<pre><code>for airport in airports:
    if not airport.is_important: continue
    &lt;body of loop&gt;
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>This is a design philosophy of python.  If it takes you too many words to put it on one line, it should be broken into a few lines to help the person who comes after you.  List and generator expressions are more for transforming iterables in-place -- making more readable forms of <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Using list comprehension (only if airports is a list of objects):</p>

<pre><code>for airport in [a for a in airports if a.is_important]:
</code></pre>
