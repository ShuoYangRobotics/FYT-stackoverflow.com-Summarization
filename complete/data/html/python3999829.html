<h3>Question (ID-3999829):</h3><h2>Which Python IDE can run my script line-by-line?</h2><p>I wouldn't call myself programmer, but I've started learning Python recently and really enjoy it.</p>

<p>I mainly use it for small tasks so far - scripting, text processing, KML generation and ArcGIS.</p>

<p>From my experience with R (working with excellent Notepad++ and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/npptor/" rel="nofollow">NppToR</a> combo) I usually try to work with my scripts line by line (or region by region) in order to understand what each step of my script is doing.. and to check results on the fly.</p>

<p>My question: is there and IDE (or editor?) for Windows that lets you evaluate single line of Python script?</p>

<p>I <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/81584/what-ide-to-use-for-python">have</a> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/60784/poll-which-python-ide-editor-is-the-best">seen</a> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/126753/is-there-a-good-free-python-ide-for-windows">quite</a> a lot of discussion regarding IDEs in Python context.. but havent stubled upon this specific question so far.</p>

<p>Thanks for help!</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The only one I've had success with is <a href="http://eclipse.org" rel="nofollow">Eclipse</a> with <a href="http://pydev.org" rel="nofollow">Pydev</a></p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If you are on Windows, give <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pyscripter/" rel="nofollow">Pyscripter</a> a try -- it offers comprehensive, step-through debugging, which will let you examine the state of your variables at each step of your code.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>WingIDE, I've been using it successfully for over a year, and very pleased with it.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/" rel="nofollow">PyCharm</a> from JetBrains has a very nice debugger that you can step through code with.</p>

<p>Django and console integration built in.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Take the hint: The basic Python Read-Execute-Print-Loop (REPL) must work.  </p>

<p>Want Evidence? </p>

<p>Here it is: The IDE's don't offer much of an alternative.    If REPL wasn't effective, there's be lots of very cool alternatives.  Since REPL is so effective, there are few alternatives.</p>

<p>Note that languages like Java must have a step-by-step debugger because there's no REPL.</p>

<p>Here's the other hint.</p>

<p>If you design your code well, you can import your libraries of functions and classes and exercise them in REPL model.  Many, many Python packages are documented by exercising the package at the REPL level and copying the interactions.</p>

<p>The Django documentation -- as one example -- has a lot of interactive sessions that demonstrate how the parts work together at the REPL prompt.</p>

<p>This isn't very GUI.  There's little pointing and clicking.  But it seems to be effective.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>If you like R's layout. I highly recommend trying out <a href="http://packages.python.org/spyder/" rel="nofollow">Spyder</a>. If you are using windows, try out Python(x,y). It is a package with a few different editors and a lot of common extra modules like scipy and numpy.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>I use Notepad++ for most of my Windows based Python development and for debugging I use <a href="http://winpdb.org/about/" rel="nofollow">Winpdb</a>. It's a cross platform GUI based debugger. You can actually setup a keyboard shortcut in Notepad++ to launch the debugger on your current script:</p>

<p>To do this go to "Run" -> "Run ..." in the menu and enter the following, making sure the path points to your winpdb_.pyw file:</p>

<pre><code>C:\python26\Scripts\winpdb_.pyw "$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)"
</code></pre>

<p>Then choose "Save..." and pick a shortcut that you wish to use to launch the debugger. </p>

<p>PS: You can also setup a shortcut to execute your python scripts similarly using this string instead:</p>

<pre><code>C:\python26\python.exe "$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)"
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>The Pythonwin IDE has a built-in debugger at lets you step through your code, inspect variables, etc.</p>

<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/" rel="nofollow">http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/</a></p>

<p>The package also includes a bunch of other utility classes and modules that are very useful when writing Python code for Windows (interfacing with COM, etc.). </p>

<p>It's also discussed in the O'Reilly book <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9781565926219" rel="nofollow">Python Programming On Win32</a> by Mark Hammond. </p>
