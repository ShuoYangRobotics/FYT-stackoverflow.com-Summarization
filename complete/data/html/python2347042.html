<h3>Question (ID-2347042):</h3><h2>How to run a python script without specifying the file extension (cross platform solution)?</h2><p>Let's say that we have a Python script <code>do.py</code> and we want to be able to call it without extension, like <code>do</code> or <code>./do</code>. </p>

<p>If we rename the file from <code>do.py</code> to <code>do</code> and assure we have a valid shebang line it will work for all platforms but Windows. On Windows there is no way of executing file without extension.</p>

<p>On Windows, if we keep the original file extension we'll be able to call the script without the full name because the Python installer registers the <code>.py</code> extension as an executable one.</p>

<p>It looks that we need to deliver the same script under two different names in order to be call it on Windows and non-Windows environments. I really do not like this and I'm looking for a solution without this redundancy.</p>

<p>Another common approach on this is to add a <code>do.cmd</code> wrapper batch file that is calling the original <code>do.py</code> file. This has at least one major issue: it does <strong>break the Ctrl+C / Ctrl+Break</strong> because there is no way to prevent <code>cmd.exe</code> from prompting you with <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1234571/how-can-i-suppress-the-terminate-batch-job-in-cmd-exe"><strong>Terminate batch job? (Y/N)</strong> message.</a></p>

<p>If we are about to use a wrapper we need to be sure that:</p>

<ul>
<li>return the errorcode (errorlevel) returned by the original script</li>
<li>it will not change the environment</li>
<li>it will reuse the same console (no new windows)</li>
<li>doesn't interfere with STDOUT, STDIN or STDERR</li>
<li>be friendly with Ctrl-C (no prompts)</li>
</ul>

<p>I suppose the optimal solution is still to use a wrapper. Batch won't work, native executable would add a lot of complexity so probably a wrapper wrote in python itself would do.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>On windows i added the '.py' extension to the 'PATHEXT' environment variable and that works for me - if the .py file is stored in an directory that is part of the 'PATH' environment variable.</p>

<pre><code>C:\&gt;echo %PATHEXT%
.COM;.EXE;.BAT;.CMD;.PY;.JS;.JSE
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>So far I came up with this solution that seams to work. Create a file <code>yourname.py</code> with this content:</p>

<pre><code>import os, sys
filename = os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(sys.argv[0]))[0]
if not os.path.exists(filename):
    # filename does not exists, we will emulate cmd behaviour
    sys.stderr.write("'%s' is not recognized as an internal or external command,\noperable program or batch file." % filename)
    sys.exit(9009)
ret = os.system("python %s %s" % (
        filename,
        " ".join(sys.argv[1:])
        ))
exit(ret)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>you can always call your script with the Python interpreter. You get the same consistency in *nix, when you use the interpreter.</p>

<p>Windows</p>

<pre><code>c:\&gt; python c:\path\to\myscript 
</code></pre>

<p>*nix</p>

<pre><code>$ python /path/to/myscript
</code></pre>

<p>If its not what you want, then i am mis-interpreting your question.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You can use distutils to install scripts into the Python installation (the easy_install tool is installed like that, for example).</p>

<p>For Windows, you can use <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/py2exe/" rel="nofollow">py2exe</a> to create a script that can be executed without file extension. On Linux you can simply use a file without extension, but including a shebang line.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Write your main Python module with a <code>.py</code> extension.  Set up <code>PATHEXT</code> correctly, and it will run on Windows without having to type the extension.</p>

<p>On Unix, write a second Python program that simply imports the first, using she-bang syntax.  No extension on this file - it's a shell script.  Like this:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
import do
</code></pre>

<p>This will have the effect of importing <code>do.py</code>.</p>

<p>Only <code>do</code> needs to be marked as executable for Unix.  <code>do.py</code> is a module in that environment.</p>

<p>When you import a module, the code in the module is run once.</p>

<p>It doesn't completely remove redundancy, but it's close.  And it is probably the best solution possible for cross-platform scripting.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>On Windows you can use the normal file association methods and the PATHEXT environment variable to be able to call scripts without their extensions.</p>
