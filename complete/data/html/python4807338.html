<h3>Question (ID-4807338):</h3><h2>Web Interaction Using Python</h2><p>I have learned basics of python syntax from O'Reilly Learning Python. Now I want to learn how to interact with INTERNET using python.</p>

<p>Please recommend some book on the topic for both beginner and advance web programming using python.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>I don't want django, I want to learn how make automated http query to site, downloading web page,libcurl like in php, sql injection, bots programming and stuffs that a browser can do etc etc.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>I don't want to study a specific module, I want a complete book on web programming, which teaches the basics of it.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>I am not learning it to hack into someones system or server.I need it to participate in my a on line intrusion competition.</p>

<p>Also <a href="http://www.djangobook.com/en/1.0/chapter01/" rel="nofollow">Django Book</a> is great. And Free.</p>

<p>EDIT: </p>

<p>I see your edit, you don't want a web framework. For an http client in python <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/httplib.html" rel="nofollow">httplib</a> or <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/urllib.html" rel="nofollow">urllib</a> is a good module</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>What is 'interaction with internet'?</p>

<p>Web development is one thing; there's plenty of frameworks.</p>

<p>Accessing web servers is another thing; research <code>urllib2</code>, <code>httplib</code> et al., and <code>beautifulsoup</code>.</p>

<p>Lower-level interaction: research <code>socket</code>, then probably <code>twisted</code>.</p>

<p>But unless you <em>state</em> a problem, no tool can help you solve it.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I would recommend "Dive into Python". It's well written and practical. There is a chapter on HTTP web service.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><blockquote>

  page, stuffs that browseer can do.</p>

<p>You can use the <code>[urllib2][1]</code> module<br>
or you may be interested in programming with the socket api, you can see this book:<code>[Foundations of Python Network Programming][2]</code></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I think that you may look at <a href="http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/" rel="nofollow">Mechanize</a> library. It's better than using urllib2 to download the pages. </p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>For what you are asking for, start looking into <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/urllib2.html" rel="nofollow">urllib2</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>(based on the OP's super vague question, comments, and edits about searching for a book.)</p>

<p>this looks like it might contain some of what you are looking for:</p>
