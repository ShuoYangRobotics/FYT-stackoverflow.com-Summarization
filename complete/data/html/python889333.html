<h3>Question (ID-889333):</h3><h2>How to check if a file is a valid image file?</h2><p>I am currently using PIL.</p>

<pre><code>import Image
try:
    im=Image.open(filename)
    # do stuff
except IOError:
    # filename not an image file
</code></pre>

<p>However, while this sufficiently covers most cases, some image files like, xcf, svg and psd are not being detected. Psd files throws an OverflowError exception.</p>

<p>Is there someway I could include them as well?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I have just found the builtin <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/imghdr.html">imghdr</a> module. From python documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The imghdr module determines the type
  of image contained in a file or byte
  stream.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is how it works:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import imghdr
&gt;&gt;&gt; imghdr.what('/tmp/bass')
'gif'
</code></pre>

<p>Using a module is much better than reimplementing similar functionality</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>A lot of times the first couple chars will be a magic number for various file formats.  You could check for this in addition to your exception checking above. </p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>In addition to what Brian is suggesting you could use PIL's <a href="http://www.pythonware.com/library/pil/handbook/image.htm" rel="nofollow">verify</a> method to check if the file is broken.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>im.verify()</p>
  
  <p>Attempts to determine if the file is
  broken, without actually decoding the
  image data. If this method finds any
  problems, it raises suitable
  exceptions. This method only works on
  a newly opened image; if the image has
  already been loaded, the result is
  undefined. Also, if you need to load
  the image after using this method, you
  must reopen the image file. Attributes</p>
</blockquote>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Would checking the file extensions be acceptable or are you trying to confirm the data itself represents an image file?</p>

<p>If you can check the file extension a regular expression or a simple comparison could satisfy the requirement.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>On Linux, you could use python-magic (<a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-magic/0.1" rel="nofollow">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-magic/0.1</a>) which uses libmagic to identify file formats.</p>

<p>AFAIK, libmagic looks into the file and tries to tell you more about it than just the format, like bitmap dimensions, format version etc.. So you might see this as a superficial test for "validity".</p>

<p>For other definitions of "valid" you might have to write your own tests.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You could use the Python bindings to libmagic, <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-magic/" rel="nofollow">python-magic</a> and then check the mime types. This won't tell you if the files are corrupted or intact but it should be able to determine what type of image it is.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Well, I do not know about the insides of psd, but I, sure, know that, as a matter of fact, svg is not an image file per se, -- it is based on xml, so it is, essentially, a plain text file.</p>
