<h3>Question (ID-1015592):</h3><h2>Why is `self` in Python objects immutable?</h2><p>Why can't I perform an action like the following:</p>

<pre><code>class Test(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self = 5

t = Test()
print t
</code></pre>

<p>I would expect it to print <code>5</code> since we're overwriting the instance with it, but instead it doesn't do anything at all. Doesn't even throw an error. Just ignores the assignment.</p>

<p>I understand that there would be hardly any situations where one would want to do that, but it still seems odd that you can't.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I now understand <em>why</em> it doesn't work, but I'd still like to know if there is any way of replacing an instance from within the instance.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p><em>Any</em> simple assignment to <em>any</em> argument of <em>any</em> function behaves exactly the same way in Python: binds that name to a different value, and does nothing else whatsoever. "No special case is special enough to break the rules", as the Zen of Python says!-)</p>

<p>So, far from it being odd (that simply=assigning to a specific argument in a specific function has no externally visible effect whatsoever), it would be utterly <em>astonishing</em> if this specific case worked in any other way, just because of the names of the function and argument in question.</p>

<p>Should you ever want to make a class that constructs an object of a different type than itself, such behavior is of course quite possible -- but it's obtained by overriding the special method <code>__new__</code>, <strong>not</strong> <code>__init__</code>:</p>

<pre><code>class Test(object):
    def __new__(cls):
        return 5

t = Test()
print t
</code></pre>

<p>This <em>does</em> emit <code>5</code>.  The <code>__new__</code> / <code>__init__</code> behavior in Python is an example of the "two-step construction" design pattern: the "constructor" proper is <code>__new__</code> (it builds and returns a (normally uninitialized) object (normally a new one of the type/class in question); <code>__init__</code> is the "initializer" which properly initializes the new object.</p>

<p>This allows, for example, the construction of objects that are immutable once constructed: in this case everything must be done in <code>__new__</code>, before the immutable object is constructed, since, given that the object is immutable, <code>__init__</code> cannot mutate it in order to initialize it.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>It doesnt "ignore" the assignment. The assignment works just fine, you created a local name that points to the data 5.</p>

<p>If you <em>really</em> want to do what you are doing...</p>

<pre><code>class Test(object):
    def __new__(*args):
        return 5
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I just ran a quick test, and you can assign to self.  Inside your <strong>init</strong>() method, print out the value of self.  You'll see that it's 5.</p>

<p>What you're missing here is that parameters are passed by value in Python.  So, changing the value of a variable in a function or method won't change it for the outside world.</p>

<p>All that being said, I would strongly advise against ever changing self.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Dr. Egon Spengler: It would be bad.<br />
Dr. Peter Venkman: I'm fuzzy on the whole good/bad thing. What do you mean, "bad"?<br />
Dr. Egon Spengler: Try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and every molecule in your body exploding at the speed of light.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Sometimes you want to do this, though not with immutable types like <code>int</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class Test(list):
    ... def __init__(self):
    ...    list.__init__(self, [1,2,3])   # self = [1,2,3] seems right, but isn't

&gt;&gt; t = Test()
&gt;&gt; print t
[1, 2, 3]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><pre><code>class Test(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self = 5

t = Test()
print t
</code></pre>

<p>is like having this PHP (only other lang i know, sorry)</p>

<pre><code>class Test {
    function __construct() {
            $this = 5;
        }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I don't see how it makes sense. replacing the instance with a value?</p>
