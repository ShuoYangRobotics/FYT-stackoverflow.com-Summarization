<h3>Question (ID-661017):</h3><h2>Access to errno from Python?</h2><p>I am stuck with a fairly complex Python module that does not return useful error codes (it actually fails disturbingly silently). However, the underlying C library it calls sets errno.</p>

<p>Normally errno comes in over OSError attributes, but since I don't have an exception, I can't get at it.</p>

<p>Using ctypes, libc.errno doesn't work because errno is a macro in GNU libc. Python 2.6 has some affordances but Debian still uses Python 2.5. Inserting a C module into my pure Python program just to read errno disgusts me.</p>

<p>Is there some way to access errno? A Linux-only solution is fine, since the library being wrapped is Linux-only. I also don't have to worry about threads, as I'm only running one thread during the time in which this can fail.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Here is a snippet of code that allows to access <code>errno</code>:</p>

<pre><code>from ctypes import *

libc = CDLL("libc.so.6")

get_errno_loc = libc.__errno_location
get_errno_loc.restype = POINTER(c_int)

def errcheck(ret, func, args):
    if ret == -1:
        e = get_errno_loc()[0]
        raise OSError(e)
    return ret

copen = libc.open
copen.errcheck = errcheck

print copen("nosuchfile", 0)
</code></pre>

<p>The important thing is that you check <code>errno</code> as soon as possible after your function call, otherwise it may already be overwritten.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Belowed code is not reliable (or comprehensive, there are a plefora of ways <code>errno</code> could be defined) but it should get you started (or reconsider your position on a tiny extension module (after all on Debian <code>python setup.py install</code> or <code>easy_install</code> should have no problem to build it)).

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>It looks like you can use this patch that will provide you with <code>ctypes.get_errno/set_errno</code></p>

<p><a href="http://bugs.python.org/issue1798" rel="nofollow">http://bugs.python.org/issue1798</a></p>

<p>This is the patch that was actually applied to the repository:</p>

<p><a href="http://svn.python.org/view?view=rev&amp;revision=63977" rel="nofollow">http://svn.python.org/view?view=rev&amp;revision=63977</a></p>

<p>Otherwise, adding a new C module that does nothing but return errno /is/ disgusting, but so is the library that you're using. I would do that in preference to patching python myself.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Gave up and tracked through the C headers.</p>

<pre><code>import ctypes
c = ctypes.CDLL("libc.so.6")
c.__errno_location.restype = ctypes.POINTER(ctypes.c_int)
c.write(5000, "foo", 4)
print c.__errno_location().contents # -&gt; c_long(9)
</code></pre>

<p>It doesn't work in the python command prompt because it resets errno to read from stdin.</p>

<p>Once you know the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%5F%5Ferrno%5Flocation%2Bctypes" rel="nofollow">magic word of __errno_location</a> this looks like a common pattern. But with just <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=errno%2Bctypes" rel="nofollow">errno</a> I was pretty lost.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I'm not sure if this is what you and Jerub are referring to, but you could write a very short C extension that just exports errno, i.e. with <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.1/ext/simpleExample.html" rel="nofollow">the python language interface</a>. </p>

<p>Otherwise, I agree with you that having to add this small bit of compiled code is a pain.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>ctypes actually gives a standard way to access python's c implementation, which is using errno. I haven't tested this on anything other than my (linux) system, but this should be very portable:</p>

<p>ctypes.c_int.in_dll(ctypes.pythonapi,"errno")</p>

<p>which returns a c_int containing the current value.</p>
