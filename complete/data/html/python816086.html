<h3>Question (ID-816086):</h3><h2>Scientific Plotting in Python</h2><p>I have a large data set of tuples containing (time of event, latitude, longitude) that I need to visualize. I was hoping to generate a 'movie'-like xy-plot, but was wondering if anyone has a better idea or if there is an easy way to do this in Python?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for the help,

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The easiest option is matplotlib.  Two particular solutions that might work for you are:</p>

<p>1) You can generate a series of plots, each a snapshot at a given time.  These can either be displayed as a dynamic plot in matplotlib, where the axes stay the same and the data moves around; or you can save the series of plots to separate files and later combine them to make a movie (using a separate application).  There a number of examples in the official examples for doing these things.</p>

<p>2) A simple scatter plot, where the colors of the circles changes with time might work well for your data.  This is super easy.  See <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/examples/pylab_examples/ellipse_collection.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>, for example, which produces this figure

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I'd try rpy. All the power of R, from within python.

<p>rpy is awesome.</p>

<p>Check out the CRAN library for animations,
<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/animation/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/animation/index.html</a></p>

<p>Of course, you have to learn a bit about R to do this, but if you're planning to do this kind of thing routinely in future it will be well worth your while to learn.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>If you are interested in scientific plotting using Python then have a look at Mlab: <a href="http://code.enthought.com/projects/mayavi/docs/development/html/mayavi/mlab.html" rel="nofollow">http://code.enthought.com/projects/mayavi/docs/development/html/mayavi/mlab.html</a></p>

<p>It allows you to plot 2d / 3d and animate your data and the quality of the charts is really high. </p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Enthought's <a href="http://code.enthought.com/chaco/" rel="nofollow">Chaco</a> is designed for interactive/updating plots.  the api and such takes a little while to get use to, but once you're there it's a fantastic framework to work with.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I have had reasonable success with Python applications generating SVG with animation features embedded, but this was with a smaller set of elements than what you probably have.  For example, if your data is about a seismic event, show a circle that shows up when the event happened and grows in size matching the magnitude of the event.  A moving indicator over a timeline is really simple to add.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.kevlindev.com/samples/kaleidoscope/kaleidoscope.svg" rel="nofollow">Kaleidoscope</a> (Opera, others maybe, Safari not) shows lots of pieces moving around and I found inspirational.  Lots of other good SVG tutorial content on the site too.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>You might want to look at <a href="http://pyqwt.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">PyQwt</a>. It's a plotting library which works with Qt/PyQt. </p>

<p>Several of the PyQwt examples (in the qt4examples directory) show how to create "moving" / dynamically changing plots -- look at <code>CPUplot.py</code>, <code>MapDemo.py</code>, <code>DataDemo.py</code>.  </p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Jython (i.e. Python in Java) is a perfect OO approach for scientific computing.
You can look at the jHepWork project <a href="http://jwork.org/jhepwork/" rel="nofollow">http://jwork.org/jhepwork/</a> 
Perhaps you will need to look at the tutorial and examples here:</p>

<p>Note that the syntax is in Python, but you can call the Java classes and numerical libraries</p>
