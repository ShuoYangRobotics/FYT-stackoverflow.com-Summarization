<h3>Question (ID-1999727):</h3><h2>Find the type of an attribute in a class</h2><p>I want determine the type of an attribute in a class.  I am using <code>setattr</code> to set the value, and I would like to check the type that is expected, so that I can properly convert a string value before calling <code>setattr</code>.</p>

<p>How do you do this in python?</p>

<p>EDIT 1-
Some additional information based on the answers so far:</p>

<p>I only know the name of the property that I want the type for, here is some code:</p>

<pre><code>def populate_object_properties(values_as_strings, 
                               object_to_populate, 
                               properties_to_populate):
    for k in properties_to_populate:        
        value = values_as_strings.get(k)
        if value:
            setattr(object_to_populate, k, value)
        else:
            setattr(object_to_populate, k, None)
</code></pre>

<p>I want to be able test that <code>value</code> is the right type before I call <code>setattr</code>.</p>

<p>Edit 2- The reason why I need to validate the type, is that I'm using Google AppEngine's db.Model as the base type for the <code>object_to_populate</code>, and it doesn't like when a put a string into an <code>int</code> type.  I was trying to keep the question as simple as possible, but maybe that piece of information makes a difference in how someone would answer.(?)</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You seem to misunderstand how Python (the language) is designed. Attributes have no a-priori type (the language is dynamically typed), and therefore it makes, most of the time, little sense to try to coerce attributes explicitly when setting them.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>In AppEngine, each model has a <code>properties()</code> class method, which returns the dict of properties you declared in your model. You can use it to check the types your model expects for each attribute:</p>

<pre><code>def populate_object_properties(values_as_strings, 
                               object_to_populate, 
                               properties_to_populate):
    model_properties = object_to_populate.properties()
    for k in properties_to_populate:        
        value = values_as_strings.get(k)
        model_property = model_properties.get(k)
        if value:
            if isinstance(model_property, StringProperty):
                setattr(object_to_populate, k, str(value))
            elif isinstance(model_property, IntegerProperty):
                setattr(object_to_populate, k, int(value))
        else:
            setattr(object_to_populate, k, None)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Check a.<code>__class__</code> , or maybe isinstance(obj, class) if you want to check if the type is as expected.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.__class__
&lt;type 'int'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance(a, int)
True
</code></pre>

<p>more to the point for you is probably:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; b = "10"
&gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance(b, str)
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance(b, int)
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; int(b)
10
</code></pre>

<p>If your only goal is to set an attribute if the given argument can be expressed as an integer you could also use something like:</p>

<pre><code>def convert(x):
    try:
      return int(x) # Or do something else with it
    except ValueError, e: 
      print "The value", x, "is not an integer"
      raise

convert(123) # =&gt; 123 
convert("123") # =&gt; 123
convert("abc") # =&gt; ValueError
</code></pre>

<p>Some extra text in the question makes me think of changing:</p>

<pre><code>value = values_as_strings.get(k)
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>try:
  value = int( values_as_strings.get(k) )
except ValueError, e:
  # It's not an int or string with int contents, what to do?
  raise
</code></pre>

<p>resulting in:</p>

<pre><code>try:
  setattr(object_to_populate, k, int( values_as_strings.get(k) ))
except:
  setattr(object_to_populate, k, None)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>you can use <code>type(a.v)</code> to check it, but if it doesn't have a default value, it could as well be None or undefined.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; class A:
&gt;&gt;    v=10
&gt;&gt;    u=None
&gt;&gt; a=A()
&gt;&gt; print type(a.v)
&lt;type 'int'&gt;
&gt;&gt; print type(a.u)
&lt;type 'NoneType'&gt;
&gt;&gt; print type(a.w)
AttributeError
&gt;&gt; a.w=20
&gt;&gt; print type(a.w)
&lt;type 'int'&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Python builtin tools for introspecion are not utterly useful here. I wouldn't rely on them in this case. For example xmlrpc libs provide more helpful ways for doing that.</p>

<p>If you only know the name use a.getattr('v') instead of a.v in the code above.</p>

<pre><code>if type(getattr(object_to_populate, k))==type('a'):
    setattr(object_to_populate, k, value)
</code></pre>

<p>or use isinstance as suggested by extraneon, it's just the same.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Since python does not do type checking in this case you have to implement this feature by hand (or use existing libraries; see Alex Martellis answer).</p>

<p>One approach: Check if the value is an instance of the desired type, via <code>isinstance</code>.</p>

<p>Here is a modified version of your code, I'd start with ...</p>

<pre><code># 'pdict' is a dictionary of property-value pairs { 'property' : 'value', ... }
def populate_object_properties(object_to_populate, pdict):
    for p, v in pdict.items():
        setattr(object_to_populate, p, v)
</code></pre>

<p>Then we add the typecheck, for this example, we just want to populate the attributes of the object with objects of the same type as the currently used values ....</p>

<pre><code>def populate_object_properties(object_to_populate, pdict):
    for p, v in pdict.items():

        current_value = getattr(p, v, None)
        klass = type(current_value)

        # allow setting the attribute, when 
        # 
        #    - the attribute did not exist before,
        #    - the attribute value was 'None',
        #    - the value to be inserted is of the same type as the current value

        if not current_value or isinstance(v, klass): 
            setattr(object_to_populate, p, v)
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>A couple of sidenotes:</p>

<pre><code># why don't you just take two parameters? 1) the object, 2) a dict with 
# property-value pairs?

def populate_object_properties(values_as_strings, 
                               object_to_populate, 
                               properties_to_populate):

    for k in properties_to_populate:        
        value = values_as_strings.get(k)

        # here you are branching on 'value', just to populate 
        # property 'k' with whah might have been 'value' before ..
        # it's nothing serious, though, just a bit too much to read

        if value:
            setattr(object_to_populate, k, value)
        else:
            setattr(object_to_populate, k, None)

        # you could simply write:
        # setattr(object_to_populate, k, value)
</code></pre>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Normally, a Python class (or instance thereof) carries no information regarding what types it "expects" any given attribute to have, because it has no such "expectation".</p>

<p>When you need to encode such metadata, rather than "rolling your own", you can use existing third party extensions like Enthought's <a href="http://code.enthought.com/projects/traits/" rel="nofollow">Traits</a> -- in Traits, among other features, you get:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Validation</strong>: A trait attribute's type
  is explicitly declared . The type is
  evident in the code, and only values
  that meet a programmer-specified set
  of criteria (i.e., the trait
  definition) can be assigned to that
  attribute. Note that the default value
  need not meet the criteria defined for
  assignment of values.</p>
</blockquote>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Since explicit type-checking is so un-pythonic, consider just wrapping the value in <code>int()</code>.  Then, if the value (whatever it is) can be coerced into an <code>int</code>, it will be.  If it cannot be coerced into an <code>int</code>, then you need to throw an error anyway (which it will do automatically).</p>

<p>This is an example of the fundamental difference between "look before you leap" and "it's easier to ask forgiveness than to ask permission".  Python isn't a "look before you leap" language, it's an "it's easier to ask forgiveness than ask permission" language. :)</p>
