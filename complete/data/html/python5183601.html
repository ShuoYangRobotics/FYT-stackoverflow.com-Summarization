<h3>Question (ID-5183601):</h3><h2>How to get the current running module path/name</h2><p>I've searched and this seems to be a simple question without a simple answer.</p>

<p>I have the file <code>a/b/c.py</code> which would be called with <code>python -m a.b.c</code>. I would like to obtain the value <code>a.b.c</code> in the module level.</p>

<pre><code>
USAGE = u'''\
Usage:
    python -m %s -h
''' % (what_do_i_put_here,)
</code></pre>

<p>So when I receive the <code>-h</code> option, I display the <code>USAGE</code> without the need to actually write down the actual value in each and every script.</p>

<p>Do I really need to go through <code>inspect</code> to get the desired value?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> As said, there are answers (I've searched), but not simple answers. Either use <code>inspect</code>, use of <code>traceback</code>, or manipulate <code>__file__</code> and <code>__package__</code> and do some substring to get the answer. But nothing as simple as if I had a class in the module, I could just use <code>myClass.__module__</code> and I would get the answer I want. The use of <code>__name__</code> is (unfortunately) useless as it's always <code>__main__</code>.</p>

<p>Also, this is in python 2.6 and I cannot use any other versions.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>This works for me:</p>

<pre><code>__loader__.fullname
</code></pre>

<p>Also if I do python -m b.c from a\ I get 'b.c' as expected.</p>

<p>Not entirely sure what the __loader__ attribute is so let me know if this is no good.</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong>: It comes from PEP 302: <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0302/" rel="nofollow">http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0302/</a></p>

<p>Interesting snippets from the link:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The load_module() method has a few responsibilities that it must
     fulfill <em>before</em> it runs any code:</p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>It should add an __loader__ attribute to the module, set to the
   loader object.  This is mostly for introspection, but can be used
   for importer-specific extras, for example getting data associated
   with an importer.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>So it looks like it should work fine in all cases.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>When run with -m, <code>sys.path[0]</code> contains the full path to the module.  You could use that to build the name.</p>

<p>source: <a href="http://docs.python.org/using/cmdline.html#command-line" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/using/cmdline.html#command-line</a></p>

<p>Another option may be the <code>__package__</code> built in variable which is available within modules.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I think you're actually looking for the <code>__name__</code> special variable. From the <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/modules.html" rel="nofollow">Python documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Within a module, the moduleâ€™s name (as a string) is available as the value of the global variable <strong>name</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you run a file directly, this name will '<strong>main</strong>'. However, if you're in a module (as in the case where you're using the -m flag, or any other import), it will be the complete name of the module.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The only way is to do path manipulation with os.getcwd(), os.path, <strong>file</strong> and whatnot, as you mentioned.</p>

<p>Actually, it could be a good patch to implement for optparse / argparse (which currently replace "%prog" in the usage string with os.path.basename(sys.argv[0]) -- you <em>are</em> using optparse, right? -- ), i.e. another special string like %module.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Can't see why there is such a restriction as "python -m a.b.c". Of course, the actual module could be inside some zip or whatever, but I'd rather simplified the whole approach with a wrapper script, which makes sure execution happens in the right context, with right python instance.</p>

<p>The wrapper can contain as little as:</p>

<pre><code>import sys
__import__(sys.argv[1])
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can use your favorite method to get the module name for usage.</p>

<p>back to the original requirement. If I understood correctly, the idea is that someone runs a python file in some sub-sub-directory to find out from usage message that it is really a module of some.mega.package.</p>

<p>I think, there is no reliable, generic way to determine if one wants to run c, b.c or a.b.c module, without some file system analysis with certain heuristics (say, finding all __init__.py in the outer directories till the points there are no more __init__.py), and even with the analysis its not 100%.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>you should hardcode <code>a.b.c</code> in your help, if you distribute the package as such then that's the way to call it regardless of where <code>a</code> is located in the filesystem, as long as it's on the PYTHONPATH it'll be imported.</p>
