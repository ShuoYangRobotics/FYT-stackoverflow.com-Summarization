<h3>Question (ID-4216398):</h3><h2>Check integer base representation</h2><p>I define an integer like this:</p>

<pre><code>x = 0xFF
</code></pre>

<p>But when i ask for its value to the interpreter i get:</p>

<pre><code>255
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a way to force the interpreter to return me the value the same way I defined it? 
Is there a way to check the base representation for an integer?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p><strong>No.</strong> Neither Python nor any other language I know stores the base you write an integer literal in. <code>0xFF</code> is indistinguishable from <code>255</code>. These are both converted to the same underlying representation: binary.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you want to remember a base then you need a different type than <code>int</code>. Perhaps store the integers in string form <code>"0xFF"</code>, or as a tuple <code>(0xFF, 16)</code>. <code>int</code> simply doesn't have the information you want.</p></li>
<li><p>More realistically, it is your responsibility to format output the way you want. If you feed a hexadecimal number into a function and get a result back, it's your job to format the result as hexadecimal as well. I would not expect this code to "do what you want":</p>

<pre><code>print foobar(10)
print foobar(0xFF)
</code></pre>

<p>Make your intentions explicit. If the default formatting (decimal) isn't to your liking then override it:</p>

<pre><code>print '%04d' % (foobar(10)))
print '%04x' % (foobar(0xff)))
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>0x is hex.</p>

<p>To force the interpreter to show the original value:</p>

<pre><code>hex(x)

&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 0xFFF
&gt;&gt;&gt; x
4095
&gt;&gt;&gt; hex(x)
'0xfff'
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>0xFF (hex) and 255 (decimal) are the same number. So are 0377 (octal) and 11111111 (binary). Whatever base you define it in, it's the same underlying value, and it no longer matters how you declared it.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The integer is represented using the standard integer representation (base 2). When you define the integer you assign it a value which is implicitly converted from your representation, so the original base is lost. If you wanted you could define your own class which stores this information along with the underlying integer value</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Anyway the value will be represented in binary. 
Python doesn't remember the way you wrote the value when you decided to assign it to a variable.<br>
If you want to store this information create a specific class that will store this information for you and display the value correctly. Note that when you will be assigning the value you will have to specify the base explicitly anyhow.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>What everyone else says above is true - 0xff is the same as 255 decimal. If you need to be able to maintain the string representation for some other purpose, you can do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>class VerboseInt(object):
   def __init__(self, val):
      '''
         pass in a string containing an integer value -- we'll detect whether
         it's hex (0x), binary (0x), octal (0), or decimal and be able to
         display it that way later...
      '''
      self.base = 10
      if val.startswith('0x'):
         self.base = 16
      elif val.startswith('0b'):
         self.base = 2
      elif val.startswith('0'):
         self.base = 8
      self.value = int(val, self.base)         

   def __str__(self):
      ''' convert our value into a string that's in the same base
      representation that we were initialized with.
      '''
      formats = { 10 : ("", "{0}"), 
            2: ("0b", "{0:b}"), 
            8: ("0", "{0:o}"), 
            16: ("0x", "{0:x}")
            }

      fmt = formats[self.base]
      return fmt[0] + fmt[1].format(self.value)

   def __repr__(self):
      return str(self)

   def __int__(self):
      ''' get our value as an integer'''
      return self.value
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>What would you expect from:</p>

<pre><code> x = 0x7F + 128
 print x
</code></pre>

<p>The numeric base is not part of Python's internal representation of an integer. You could, if you wanted, maintain a string instead of an int, and explicitly convert to int when you needed to. </p>
