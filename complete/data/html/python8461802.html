<h3>Question (ID-8461802):</h3><h2>List a files in python and save it</h2><p>I can't save this output, maybe someone have the solution. I'm listing a directory and some singles files. But when I save the output just catch the directory files, and Not the singles files. 
My code:</p>

<pre><code>import os
tosave = open('/tmp/list','ab')
thesource = ["/etc/ssh","/var/log/syslog","/etc/hosts"]
for f in thesource:
    print f
    for top, dirs, files in os.walk(f):
        for nm in files:
            print os.path.join(top, nm)
            try:
                tosave.write(top+nm+'\n')
            finally:
                tosave.close
</code></pre>

<p>I saw in the console all files and directory, but in the saved list, just ssh files. Why didn't save syslog and hosts too?</p>

<p>Thank you !!</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You could try adding <code>tosave.flush()</code> at the end. It does cause problems sometimes. Sometimes, a flush call is required to empty the contents of the buffer into the file.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Check if this works for you</p>

<pre><code>import os
tosave = open('/tmp/list','ab')
thesource = ["/etc/ssh","/var/log/syslog","/etc/hosts"]
for f in thesource:
    if os.path.isdir(f):
        for top, dirs, files in os.walk(f):
            for nm in files:
                try:
                    tosave.write(top+nm+'\n')
    if os.path.isfile(f):
        tosave.write(f+'\n')
to.close()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><em>In case you missed the <code>()</code> at <code>tosave.close</code> while pasting: (otherwise check <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/8462202/1091453">harsh's answer</a>)</em></p>

<p>The <code>finally</code> is wrong here. The code in <code>finally</code> will be executed after the <code>try</code> block, so after the first execution of <code>tosave.write(top+nm+'\n')</code> the file will be closed because of <code>tosave.close()</code>.</p>

<p>Possibly you intended to use <code>except</code>:</p>

<pre><code>            # snip
            try:
                tosave.write(top+nm+'\n')
            except:
                tosave.close()
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Edit: To answer your comment, you want the last line to be the same as the print statement:</p>

<pre><code>                tosave.write(os.path.join(top, nm) + '\n')
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>With all your help I found a solution and it's working. I share it.</p>

<pre><code>tosave = open('/tmp/list','ab')
    thesource = ["/etc/ssh","/var/log/syslog","/etc/hosts"]
for f in thesource:
    if os.path.isfile(f):
        print f
        tosave.write(f+'\n')
    else:
        for top, dirs, files in os.walk(f):
            for nm in files:
                print os.path.join(top, nm)
                tosave.write(top+nm+'\n')
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you all for your help !!!</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Maybe this is because you're opening the file in append mode (the <code>'a'</code>) and then looking at its beginning? Look at its end - you might see your new files listed there.</p>

<p>In append mode, each time the script runs it <em>appends</em> its output to the file. Usually what one wants is just the write mode (<code>'w'</code> instead of <code>'a'</code>), which overwrites the file each time.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>In this line you're writing strings to the file:</p>

<pre><code>tosave.write(top+nm+'\n')
</code></pre>

<p>You need to open the files and read them in order to write to another file:</p>

<pre><code>tosave.write(open(os.path.join(top, nm), 'rb').read())
</code></pre>

<p>But I'm guessing you will have to deal with: <code>IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: ...</code></p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Put the <code>close()</code> at the end of the script.</p>

<p>Otherwise it will close the file after the first step in the loop, making the file unwritable.</p>
