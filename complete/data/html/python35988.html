<h3>Question (ID-35988):</h3><h2>C-like structures in Python</h2><p>Is there a way to conveniently define a C-like structure in Python? I'm tired of writing stuff like:</p>

<pre><code>class MyStruct():
    def __init__(self, field1, field2, field3)
        self.field1 = field1
        self.field2 = field2
        self.field3 = field3
</code></pre>

<p>(Interesting, it appears I can't type underscores following non-whitespace in pre-formatted text blocks)</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-9):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You can use a tuple for a lot of things where you would use a struct in C (something like x,y coordinates or RGB colors for example).</p>

<p>For everything else you can use dictionary, or a utility class like <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/52308/">this one</a>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class Bunch:
...     def __init__(self, **kwds):
...         self.__dict__.update(kwds)
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; mystruct = Bunch(field1=value1, field2=value2)
</code></pre>

<p>I think the "definitive" discussion is <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Q0s6Vgb98CQC&amp;lpg=PT212&amp;dq=Python%20Cookbook%20%22Collecting%20a%20Bunch%20of%20Named%20Items%22&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PT213#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">here</a>, in the published version of the Python Cookbook.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>For a "whole" solution, see Raymond Hettinger's <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/500261/" rel="nofollow">named tuple</a> recipe. It's nice for your basic example, but also covers a bunch of edge cases you might run into later as well. Your fragment above would be written as:</p>

<pre><code>from collections import namedtuple
MyStruct = namedtuple("MyStruct", "field1 field2 field3")
</code></pre>

<p>Named tuple is part of <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/collections.html" rel="nofollow">collections module</a> in standard library since Python 2.6.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>How about a dictionary?</p>

<p>Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>myStruct = {'field1': 'some val', 'field2': 'some val'}
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can use this to manipulate values:</p>

<pre><code>print myStruct['field1']
myStruct['field2'] = 'some other values'
</code></pre>

<p>And the values don't have to be strings.  They can be pretty much any other object.</p>

  <p>dF: that's pretty cool... I didn't
  know that I could access the fields in
  a class using dict.</p>
  
  <p>Mark: the situations that I wish I had
  this are precisely when I want a tuple
  but nothing as "heavy" as a
  dictionary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can access the fields of a class using a dictionary because the fields of a class, its methods and all its properties are stored internally using dicts (at least in Cython).</p>

<p>...Which leads us to your second comment. Believing that Python dicts are "heavy" is an extremely non-pythonistic concept. And reading such comments kills my Python Zen. That's not good.</p>

<p>You see, when you declare a class you are actually creating a pretty complex wrapper around a dictionary - so, if anything, you are adding more overhead than by using a simple dictionary. An overhead which, by the way, is meaningless in any case. If you are working on performance critical applications, use C or something.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You can also pass the init parameters to the instance variables by position</p>

<pre><code># Abstract struct class       
class Struct:
    def __init__ (self, *argv, **argd):
        if len(argd):
            # Update by dictionary
            self.__dict__.update (argd)
        else:
            # Update by position
            attrs = filter (lambda x: x[0:2] != "__", dir(self))
            for n in range(len(argv)):
                setattr(self, attrs[n], argv[n])

# Specific class
class Point3dStruct (Struct):
    x = 0
    y = 0
    z = 0

pt1 = Point3dStruct()
pt1.x = 10

print pt1.x
print "-"*10

pt2 = Point3dStruct(5, 6)

print pt2.x, pt2.y
print "-"*10

pt3 = Point3dStruct (x=1, y=2, z=3)
print pt3.x, pt3.y, pt3.z
print "-"*10
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Perhaps you are looking for Structs without constructors:</p>

<pre><code>class Sample:
  name = ''
  average = 0.0
  values = None # list cannot be initialized here!


s1 = Sample()
s1.name = "sample 1"
s1.values = []
s1.values.append(1)
s1.values.append(2)
s1.values.append(3)

s2 = Sample()
s2.name = "sample 2"
s2.values = []
s2.values.append(4)

for v in s1.values:   # prints 1,2,3 --&gt; OK.
  print v
print "***"
for v in s2.values:   # prints 4 --&gt; OK.
  print v
</code></pre>

  <p>(oh, I take that back about the double underscores... it just shows up funny in the edit preview)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep, there was just <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35808/how-do-i-get-a-double-underscore-to-show-up-in-markdown" rel="nofollow">a question about that</a>.</p>

<p>As far as your question goes, why exactly do you want to use a Struct in Python?  What are you trying to do?  Is there a more 'Pythonic' way of doing it?</p>

<p>Edited to add:
It looks like Mark posted a more 'Pythonic' approach while I was writing this</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>I'm having the same problem recently. I've found this thing, hope it helps =)</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.python.org/library/ctypes.html?highlight=ctypes#structures-and-unions" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/library/ctypes.html?highlight=ctypes#structures-and-unions</a></p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>I thought that python directories didn't have a specified or fixed order.
So the line:</p>

<p>attrs = filter (lambda x: x[0:2] != "__", dir(self))</p>

<p>only works by luck and might break at any time.  The class variables
might be returned in a different order then the order they were
declared in and/or different orders at different times.</p>
