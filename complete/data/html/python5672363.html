<h3>Question (ID-5672363):</h3><h2>Most elegant way to modify Python list elements inplace</h2><p>I have a 2D list that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>table = [['donkey', '2', '1', '0'], ['goat', '5', '3', '2']]
</code></pre>

<p>I want to change the last three elements to integers, but the code below feels very ugly:</p>

<pre><code>for row in table:
    for i in range(len(row)-1):
        row[i+1] = int(row[i+1])
</code></pre>

<p>But I'd rather have something that looks like:</p>

<pre><code>for row in table:
    for col in row[1:]:
        col = int(col)
</code></pre>

<p>I think there should be a way to write the code above, but the slice creates an iterator/new list that's separate from the original, so the references don't carry over.  </p>

<p>Is there some way to get a more Pythonic solution?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Try:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; for row in table:
...     row[1:]=map(int,row[1:])
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; table
[['donkey', 2, 1, 0], ['goat', 5, 3, 2]]
</code></pre>

<p>AFAIK, assigning to a <code>list</code> slice forces the operation to be done in place instead of creating a new <code>list</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><pre><code>for row in table:
    row[1:] = [int(c) for c in row[1:]]
</code></pre>

<p>Does above look more pythonic?</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I like Shekhar answer a lot. </p>

<p>As a general rule, when writing Python code, if you find yourself writing f<code>or i in range(len(somelist))</code>, you're doing it wrong:</p>

<ul>
<li>try <code>enumerate</code> if you have a single list</li>
<li>try <code>zip</code> or <code>itertools.izip</code> if you have 2 or more lists you want to iterate on in parallel</li>
</ul>

<p>In your case, the first column is different so you cannot elegantly use enumerate:</p>

<pre><code>for row in table:
    for i, val in enumerate(row):
        if i == 0: continue
        row[i] = int(val)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Use list comprehensions:</p>

<pre><code>table = [row[0] + [int(col) for col in row[1:]] for row in table]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Your "ugly" code can be improved just by calling <code>range</code> with two arguments:</p>

<pre><code>for row in table:
    for i in range(1, len(row)):
        row[i] = int(row[i])
</code></pre>

<p>This is probably the best you can do if you insist on changing the items in place without allocating new temporary lists (either by using a list comprehension, <code>map</code>, and/or slicing). See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4148375/is-there-an-in-place-equivalent-to-map-in-python">Is there an in-place equivalent to &#39;map&#39; in python?</a></p>

<p>Although I don't recommend it, you can also make this code more general by introducing your own in-place map function:</p>

<pre><code>def inplacemap(f, items, start=0, end=None):
    """Applies ``f`` to each item in the iterable ``items`` between the range
    ``start`` and ``end``."""
    # If end was not specified, make it the length of the iterable
    # We avoid setting end in the parameter list to force it to be evaluated on
    # each invocation
    if end is None:
        end = len(items)
    for i in range(start, end):
        items[i] = f(items[i])

for row in table:
    inplacemap(int, row, 1)
</code></pre>

<p>Personally, I find this <em>less</em> Pythonic. There is preferably only one obvious way to do it, and this isn't it.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>This will work:</p>

<pre><code>table = [[row[0]] + [int(v) for v in row[1:]] for row in table]
</code></pre>

<p>However you might want to think about doing the conversion at the point where the list is first created.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>This accomplishes what you are looking for. It is a readable solution. You can go for similar one using listcomp too.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; for row in table:
...     for i, elem in enumerate(row):
...             try:
...                     int(elem)
...             except ValueError:
...                     pass
...             else:
...                     row[i] = int(elem)
... 
</code></pre>
