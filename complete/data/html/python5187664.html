<h3>Question (ID-5187664):</h3><h2>Generating digits of square root of 2</h2><p>I want generate the digits of square root of two to a very large extent say about <strong>3 million digits.</strong></p>

<p>I am aware of <a href="http://www.sosmath.com/calculus/diff/der07/der07.html" rel="nofollow">Newton-raphson method</a> but I don't have much clue how to implement the same in C or C++ as it don't have biginteger support. Can anybody show me a pointer in this regard.</p>

<p>Also if any body know how to do the same in python (since I am just a new learner of it),I would also appreciate it.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-9):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>As for arbitrary big numbers you could have a look at <a href="http://gmplib.org/" rel="nofollow">The GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library</a> (for C/C++).</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I like this version better than the previous. It's a general solution that accepts both integers and decimal fractions; with n = 2 and precision = 100000, it takes about two minutes. Thanks to Paul McGuire for his suggestions &amp; other suggestions welcome!</p>

<pre><code>def sqrt_list(n, precision):
    ndigits = []        # break n into list of digits

    while n_int:                            # generate list of digits of integral part
        ndigits.append(n_int % 10)
        n_int /= 10
    if len(ndigits) % 2: ndigits.append(0)  # ndigits will be processed in groups of 2

    decimal_point_index = len(ndigits) / 2  # remember decimal point position
    while n_fraction:                       # insert digits from fractional part
        n_fraction *= 10

        n_fraction -= int(n_fraction)

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>The nicest way is probably using the continued fraction expansion <code>[1; 2, 2, ...]</code> the square root of two.</p>

<pre><code>def root_two_cf_expansion():
    yield 1
    while True:
        yield 2

def z(a,b,c,d, contfrac):
    for x in contfrac:
        while a &gt; 0 and b &gt; 0 and c &gt; 0 and d &gt; 0:
            t = a // c
            t2 = b // d
            if not t == t2:
                break
            yield t
            a = (10 * (a - c*t))
            b = (10 * (b - d*t))
            # continue with same fraction, don't pull new x
        a, b = x*a+b, a
        c, d = x*c+d, c
    for digit in rdigits(a, c):
        yield digit

def rdigits(p, q):
    while p &gt; 0:
        if p &gt; q:
           d = p // q
           p = p - q * d
        else:
           d = (10 * p) // q
           p = 10 * p - q * d
        yield d

def decimal(contfrac):
    return z(1,0,0,1,contfrac)
</code></pre>

<p><code>decimal((root_two_cf_expansion())</code> returns an iterator of all the decimal digits.  <code>t1</code> and <code>t2</code> in the algorithm are minimum and maximum values of the next digit.  When they are equal, we output that digit.</p>

<p>Note that this does not handle certain exceptional cases such as negative numbers in the continued fraction.</p>

<p>(This code is an adaptation of Haskell code for handling continued fractions that has been floating around.)</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>For work? Use a library!</p>

<p><strong>For fun? Good for you :)</strong></p>

<p>Write a program to imitate what you would do with pencil and paper. Start with 1 digit, then 2 digits, then 3, ..., ...</p>

<p>Don't worry about Newton or anybody else. Just do it your way.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You could try using the mapping:</p>

<p><code>a/b -&gt; (a+2b)/(a+b)</code> starting with <code>a= 1, b= 1</code>. This converges to sqrt(2) (in fact gives the continued fraction representations of it).</p>

<p>Now the key point: This can be represented as a matrix multiplication (similar to fibonacci)</p>

<p>If a_n and b_n are the nth numbers in the steps then</p>

<p>[1 2] [a_n  b_n]<sup>T</sup>   =   [a_(n+1) b_(n+1)]<sup>T</sup> <br/>
[1 1]  </p>

<p>which now gives us</p>

<p>[1 2]<sup>n</sup> [a_1 b_1]<sup>T</sup>    =   [a_(n+1) b_(n+1)]<sup>T</sup><br/>
[1 1]            </p>

<p>Thus if the 2x2 matrix is A, we need to compute A<sup>n</sup> which can be done by repeated squaring and only uses integer arithmetic (so you don't have to worry about precision issues).</p>

<p>Also note that the a/b you get will always be in reduced form (as gcd(a,b) = gcd(a+2b, a+b)), so if you are thinking of using a fraction class to represent the intermediate results, don't!</p>

<p>Since the nth denominators is like (1+sqrt(2))^n, to get 3 million digits you would likely need to compute till the 3671656<sup>th</sup> term.</p>

<p>Note, even though you are looking for the ~3.6 millionth term, repeated squaring will allow you to compute the nth term in O(Log n) multiplications and additions.</p>

<p>Also, this can easily be made parallel, unlike the iterative ones like Newton-Raphson etc.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Well, the following is the code that I wrote. It generated a million digits after the decimal for the square root of 2 in about 60800 seconds for me, but my laptop was sleeping when it was running the program, it should be faster that. You can try to generate 3 million digits, but it might take a couple days to get it.</p>

<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Python already supports big integers out of the box, and if that's the only thing holding you back in C/C++ you can always write a quick container class yourself.</p>

<p>The only problem you've mentioned is a lack of big integers. If you don't want to use a library for that, then are you looking for help writing such a class?</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Here is a short version for calculating the square root of an integer <strong>a</strong> to <strong>digits</strong> of precision. It works by finding the integer square root of <strong>a</strong> after multiplying by 10 raised to the 2 x <strong>digits</strong>.</p>

<pre><code>def sqroot(a, digits):
    a = a * (10**(2*digits))
    x_prev = 0
    x_next = 1 * (10**digits)
    while x_prev != x_next:
        x_prev = x_next
        x_next = (x_prev + (a // x_prev)) &gt;&gt; 1
    return x_next
</code></pre>

<p>Just a few caveats.</p>

<p>You'll need to convert the result to a string and add the decimal point at the correct location (if you want the decimal point printed).</p>

<p>Converting a very large integer to a string isn't very fast.</p>

<p>Dividing very large integers isn't very fast (in Python) either.</p>

<p>Depending on the performance of your system, it may take an hour or longer to calculate the square root of 2 to 3 million decimal places.</p>

<p>I haven't proven the loop will always terminate. It may oscillate between two values differing in the last digit. Or it may not. </p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>Here's a more efficient integer square root function (in Python 3.x) that should terminate in all cases. It starts with a number much closer to the square root, so it takes fewer steps. Note that int.bit_length requires Python 3.1+. Error checking left out for brevity.</p>

<pre><code>def isqrt(n):
    x = (n &gt;&gt; n.bit_length() // 2) + 1
    result = (x + n // x) // 2
    while abs(result - x) &gt; 1:
        x = result
        result = (x + n // x) // 2
    while result * result &gt; n:
        result -= 1
    return result
</code></pre>
