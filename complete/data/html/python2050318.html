<h3>Question (ID-2050318):</h3><h2>Extract the fields of a C struct</h2><p>I often have to write code in other languages that interact with C structs.  Most typically this involves writing Python code with the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/struct.html" rel="nofollow">struct</a> or <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/ctypes.html" rel="nofollow">ctypes</a> modules.</p>

<p>So I'll have a .h file full of struct definitions, and I have to manually read through them and duplicate those definitions in my Python code.  This is time consuming and error-prone, and it's difficult to keep the two definitions in sync when they change frequently.</p>

<p>Is there some tool or library in any language (doesn't have to be C or Python) which can take a .h file and produce a structured list of its structs and their fields?  I'd love to be able to write a script to generate my automatically generate my struct definitions in Python, and I don't want to have to process arbitrary C code to do it.  Regular expressions would work great about 90% of the time and then cause endless headaches for the remaining 10%.</p>

<pre>
$ pahole /bin/dd

struct option {
        const char  *              name;                 /*     0     8 */
        int                        has_arg;              /*     8     4 */

        /* XXX 4 bytes hole, try to pack */

        int *                      flag;                 /*    16     8 */
        int                        val;                  /*    24     4 */

        /* size: 32, cachelines: 1, members: 4 */
        /* sum members: 24, holes: 1, sum holes: 4 */
        /* padding: 4 */
        /* last cacheline: 32 bytes */
};
&hellip;
</pre>

<p>This should be quite a lot nicer to parse than straight C.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Have a look at <a href="http://www.swig.org/Doc1.3/Python.html" rel="nofollow">Swig</a> or <a href="http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/sip/intro" rel="nofollow">SIP</a> that would generate interface code for you or use <a href="http://python.net/crew/theller/ctypes/" rel="nofollow">ctypes</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><i>Regular expressions would work great about 90% of the time and then cause endless headaches for the remaining 10%.</i></p>

<p>The headaches happen in the cases where the C code contains syntax that you didn't think of when writing your regular expressions. Then you go back and realise that C can't really be parsed by regular expressions, and life becomes not fun.</p>

<p>Try turning it around: define your own simple format, which allows less tricks than C does, and generate both the C header file and the Python interface code from your file:</p>

<pre><code>define socketopts
    int16 port
    int32 ipv4address
    int32 flags
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can easily write some Python to convert this to:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct {
    short port;
    int ipv4address;
    int flags;
} socketopts;
</code></pre>

<p>and also to emit a Python class which uses <code>struct</code> to pack/unpack three values (possibly two of them big-endian and the other native-endian, up to you).</p>

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I have quite successfully used <a href="http://www.gccxml.org/HTML/Index.html" rel="nofollow">GCCXML</a> on fairly large projects. You get an XML representation of the C code (including structures) which you can post-process with some simple Python.</p>
