<h3>Question (ID-7234518):</h3><h2>How to check if two words are ordered in python</h2><p>what is the bes way tho check if two words are ordered in sentence and how many times it occurs in python.
For example: I like to eat maki sushi and the best sushi is in Japan. 
words are: [maki, sushi] </p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>The code </p>

<pre><code>import re

x="I like to eat maki sushi and the best sushi is in Japan"
x1 = re.split('\W+',x)
l1 = [i for i,m in enumerate(x1) if m == "maki"]
l2 = [i for i,m in enumerate(x1) if m == "sushi"]


ordered = []
for i in l1:
    for j in l2: 
        if j == i+1:
            ordered.append((i,j))

print ordered

<p>Not exactly the most efficient way of doing it but simpler to understand.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><pre><code>s = 'I like to eat maki sushi and the best sushi is in Japan'
</code></pre>

<p><b> check order </b></p>

<pre><code>indices = [s.split().index(w) for w in ['maki', 'sushi']]
sorted(indices) == indices
</code></pre>

<p><b> how to count </b></p>

<pre><code>s.split().count('maki')
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Note (based on discussion below):</p>

<p>suppose the sentence is <i>'I like makim more than sushi or maki'</i>. Realizing that <i>makim</i> is another word than <i>maki</i>, the word <i>maki</i> is placed after <i>sushi</i> and occurs only once in the sentence. To detect this and count correctly, the sentence <b>must be split</b> over the spaces into the actual words.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>According to the added code, you mean that words are adjacent?</p>

<p>Why not just put them together:</p>

<pre><code>print len(re.findall(r'\bmaki sushi\b', sent)) 
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>if res > 0:
    words are sorted in the sentence</p>

<pre><code>words = ["sushi", "maki", "xxx"]
sorted_words = sorted(words)
sen = " I like to eat maki sushi and the best sushi is in Japan xxx";
ind = map(lambda x : sen.index(x), sorted_words)
res = reduce(lambda a, b: b-a, ind)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>A regex solution :)</p>

<pre><code>import re
sent = 'I like to eat maki sushi and the best sushi is in Japan'
words = sorted(['maki', 'sushi'])
assert re.search(r'\b%s\b' % r'\b.*\b'.join(words), sent)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Just and idea, it might need some more work</p>

<pre><code>(sentence.index('maki') &lt;= sentence.index('sushi')) == ('maki' &lt;= 'sushi')
</code></pre>
