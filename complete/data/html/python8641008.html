<h3>Question (ID-8641008):</h3><h2>Compare multiple variables to the same value in "if" in Python?</h2><p>I am using Python and I would like to  have an if statement with many variables in it.</p>

<p>such as:</p>

<pre><code>  if A, B, C, and D &gt;= 2:
         print (A, B, C, and D)
</code></pre>

<p>I realize that this is not the correct syntax and that is exactly the question I am asking - what is the correct Python syntax for this type of an if statement? Thank you!</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>What about this:</p>

<pre><code>if all(x &gt;= 2 for x in (A, B, C, D)):
    print A, B, C, D
</code></pre>

<p>This should be helpful if you're testing a <em>long</em> list of variables with the same condition.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Another idea:</p>

<pre><code>if min(A, B, C, D) &gt;= 2:
    print A, B, C, D
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I'd probably write this as</p>

<pre><code>v = A, B, C, D
if all(i &gt;= 2 for i in v):
    print v
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>If you have ten variables that you are treating as a group like this, you probably want to make them elements of a list, or values in a dictionary, or attributes of an object.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>my_dict = {'A': 1, 'B': 2, 'C': 3 }

if all(x &gt; 2 for x in my_dict.values()):
    print "They're all more than two!"
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>How about:</p>

<pre><code>if A &gt;= 2 and B &gt;= 2 and C &gt;= 2 and D &gt;= 2:
    print A, B, C, D
</code></pre>

<p>For the general case, there isn't a shorter way for indicating that the same condition must be true for all variables - unless you're willing to put the variables in a list, for that take a look at some of the other answers.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Except that he's probably asking for this:</p>

<pre><code>if A &gt;= 2 and B &gt;= 2 and C &gt;= 2 and D &gt;= 2:
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Depending on what you are trying to accomplish, passing a list to a function may work.</p>

<pre><code>def foo(lst):
    for i in lst:
        if i &lt; 2:
            return
    print lst
</code></pre>
