<h3>Question (ID-806835):</h3><h2>Django: Redirect to previous page after login</h2><p>I'm trying to build a simple website with login functionality very similar to the one here on SO.
The user should be able to browse the site as an anonymous user and there will be a login link on every page. When clicking on the login link the user will be taken to the login form. After a succesfull login the user should be taken back to the page from where he clicked the login link in the first place.
I'm guessing that I have to somehow pass the url of the current page to the view that handles the login form but I can't really get it to work.
Maybe you guys could help me.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>EDIT:
I figured it out. I linked to the login form by passing the current page as a GET parameter and then used 'next' to redirect to that page. Thanks!</p>

<p>EDIT 2:
My explanation did not seem to be clear so as requested here is my code:
Lets say we are on a page foo.html and we are not logged in. Now we would like to have a link on foo.html that links to login.html. There we can login and are then redirected back to foo.html.
The link on foo.html looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>      &lt;a href='/login/?next={{ request.path }}'&gt;Login&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now I wrote a custom login view that looks somewhat like this:</p>

<pre><code>def login_view(request):
   redirect_to = request.REQUEST.get('next', '')
   if request.method=='POST':
      #create login form...
      if valid login credentials have been entered:
         return HttpResponseRedirect(redirect_to)  
   #...
   return render_to_response('login.html', locals())
</code></pre>

<p>And the important line in login.html:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form method="post" action="./?next={{ redirect_to }}"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So yeah thats pretty much it, hope that makes it clear.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You do not need to make an extra view for this, the functionality is already built in.</p>

<p>First each page with a login link needs to know the current path, and the easiest way is to add the request context preprosessor to settings.py (the 4 first are default), then the request object will be available in each request:</p>

<p><strong>settings.py:</strong></p>

<pre><code>TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = (
    "django.core.context_processors.auth",
    "django.core.context_processors.debug",
    "django.core.context_processors.i18n",
    "django.core.context_processors.media",
    "django.core.context_processors.request",
)
</code></pre>

<p>Then add in the template you want the Login link:</p>

<p><strong>base.html:</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href="{% url django.contrib.auth.views.login %}?next={{request.path}}"&gt;Login&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This will add a GET argument to the login page that points back to the current page.</p>

<p>The login template can then be as simple as this:</p>

<p><strong>registration/login.html:</strong></p>

<pre><code>{% block content %}
&lt;form method="post" action=""&gt;
  {{form.as_p}}
&lt;input type="submit" value="Login"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
{% endblock %}
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Django's built-in authentication works the way you want.</p>

<p>Their login pages include a <code>next</code> query string which is the page to return to after login.</p>

<p>Look at <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth/#django.contrib.auth.decorators.login_required" rel="nofollow">http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth/#django.contrib.auth.decorators.login_required</a> </p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>This may not be a "best practice", but I've successfully used this before:</p>

<pre><code>return HttpResponseRedirect(request.META.get('HTTP_REFERER','/'))
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I encountered the same problem. This solution allows me to keep using the generic login view:</p>

<pre><code>urlpatterns += patterns('django.views.generic.simple',
    (r'^accounts/profile/$', 'redirect_to', {'url': 'generic_account_url'}),
)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>See django docs for <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth/#django.contrib.auth.views.login" rel="nofollow">views.login()</a>, you supply a 'next' value (as a hidden field) on the input form to redirect to after a successful login.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I linked to the login form by passing the current page as a GET parameter and then used 'next' to redirect to that page. Thanks!</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>In <code>registration/login.html</code> (nested within <code>templates</code> folder) if you insert the following line, the page will render like Django's original admin login page:</p>

<pre><code>{% include "admin/login.html" %}
</code></pre>

<p><b>Note: The file should contain above lines only.</b></p>
