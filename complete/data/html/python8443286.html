<h3>Question (ID-8443286):</h3><h2>Select strings by positions of words</h2><p>For the following tuple</p>

<pre><code>mysentence = 'i have a dog and a cat', 'i have a cat and a dog', 'i have a cat', 
             'i have a dog'
</code></pre>

<p>How to select only the strings 'i have a cat' , 'i have a dog', i.e exclude strings having the word <code>dog</code> or <code>cat</code> in the middle.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You can do this with regular expressions. The regex <code>.+(dog|cat).+</code> will match one or more characters, followed by dog or cat, and one of more characters afterwards. You can then use filter to find strings which don't match this regex:</p>

<pre><code>import re
regex.compile(r'.+(dog|cat).+')
sentence = 'i have a dog and a cat', 'i have a cat and a dog', 'i have a cat', 
           'i have a dog'
filtered_sentence = filter(lambda s: not regex.match(s), sentence)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You could use a Regular Expression to match the sentences you don't want.</p>

<p>We can build up the pattern as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>We want to match dog or cat - <code>(dog|cat)</code></li>
<li>followed by a space, i.e. not at the end of the line</li>
</ul>

<p>So our code looks like so:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; mysentence = ('i have a dog and a cat', 'i have a cat and a dog', 'i have a cat', 'i have a dog')
&gt;&gt;&gt; import re                                                                   
&gt;&gt;&gt; pattern = re.compile("(dog|cat) ")
&gt;&gt;&gt; [x for x in mysentence if not pattern.search(x)]                            
['i have a cat', 'i have a dog']
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If the string should just end with a specific phrase then this will do the job:</p>

<pre><code>phases = ("I have a cat", "I have a dog")
for sentence in mysentence:
    for phase in phases:
        if sentence.lower().endswith(phase.lower()):
            print(sentence)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Simplest thing that could possibly work:</p>

<pre><code>In [10]: [phrase for phrase in mysentence if not ' and ' in phrase]
Out[10]: ['i have a cat', 'i have a dog']
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You can use regexp or string methods. </p>

<p>I see other answered with regex, so I try string methods: with <code>string.find()</code> you will get position of substring in string. Then check if it is in the middle of the sentence.</p>

<pre><code>def filter_function(sentence, words):
    for word in words:
        p = sentence.find(word)
        if p &gt; 0 and p &lt; len(sentence) - len(word):
            return 0
    return 1

for sentence in mysentence:
    print('%s: %d' % (sentence, filter_function(sentence, ['dog', 'cat'])))
</code></pre>

<p>You also must define what to do when you will have only 'cat' in sentence.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><pre><code>for items in mysentence:
    if (items.find("dog")&gt;=0)^(items.find("cat")&gt;=0):
        print(items)
</code></pre>

<p>You just need an xor operator and the find function. No need to import</p>
