<h3>Question (ID-1415812):</h3><h2>Why use **kwargs in python? What are some real world advantages over using named arguments?</h2><p>I come from a background in static languages. Can someone explain (hopefully through example) the real world advantages of using **kwargs over named arguments? To me it they seem to only make the function call more ambiguous. Thanks.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You may want to accept nearly-arbitrary named arguments for a series of reasons -- and that's what the <code>**kw</code> form lets you do.</p>

<p>The most common reason is to pass the arguments right on to some other function you're wrapping (decorators are one case of this, but FAR from the only one!) -- in this case, <code>**kw</code> loosens the coupling between wrapper and wrappee, as the wrapper doesn't have to know or care about all of the wrappee's arguments. Here's another, completely different reason:</p>

<pre><code>d = dict(a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4)
</code></pre>

<p>if all the names had to be known in advance, then obviously this approach just couldn't exist, right?  And btw, when applicable, I much prefer this way of making a dict whose keys are literal strings to:</p>

<pre><code>d = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4}
</code></pre>

<p>simply because the latter is quite punctuation-heavy and hence less readable.</p>

<p>When none of the excellent reasons for accepting <code>**kwargs</code> applies, then don't accept it: it's as simple as that. IOW, if there's no good reason to allow the caller to pass extra named args with arbitrary names, don't allow that to happen -- just avoid putting a <code>**kw</code> form at the end of the function's signature in the <code>def</code> statement.</p>

<p>As for <em>using</em> <code>**kw</code> in a call, that lets you put together the exact set of named arguments that you must pass, each with corresponding values, in a dict, independently of a single call point, then use that dict at the single calling point. Compare:</p>

<pre><code>if x: kw['x'] = x
if y: kw['y'] = y
f(**kw)
</code></pre>

<p>to:</p>

<pre><code>if x:
  if y:
    f(x=x, y=y)
  else:
    f(x=x)
else:
  if y:
    f(y=y)
  else:
    f()
</code></pre>

<p>Even with just two possibilities, and of the very simplest kind!!!, the lack of <code>**kw</code> is aleady making the second option absolutely untenable and intolerable -- just imagine how it plays out when there half a dozen possibilities, possibly in slightly richer interaction... without <code>**kw</code>, life would be absolute hell under such circumstances!</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Real-world examples:</p>

<p>Decorators - they're usually generic, so you can't specify the arguments upfront:</p>

<pre><code>def decorator(old):
    def new(*args, **kwargs):
        # ...
        return old(*args, **kwargs)
    return new
</code></pre>

<p>Places where you want to do magic with an unknown number of keyword arguments. Django's ORM does that, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>Model.objects.filter(foo__lt = 4, bar__iexact = 'bar')
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Another reason you might want to use <code>**kwargs</code> (and <code>*args</code>) is if you're extending an existing method in a subclass. You want to pass all the existing arguments onto the superclass's method, but want to ensure that your class keeps working even if the signature changes in a future version:</p>

<pre><code>class MySubclass(Superclass):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        self.myvalue = kwargs.pop('myvalue', None)
        super(MySubclass, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>There are two common cases:</p>

<p>First: You are wrapping another function which takes a number of keyword argument, but you are just going to pass them along:</p>

<pre><code>def my_wrapper(a, b, **kwargs):
    do_something_first(a, b)
    the_real_function(**kwargs)
</code></pre>

<p>Second: You are willing to accept any keyword argument, for example, to set attributes on an object:</p>

<pre><code>class OpenEndedObject:
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        for k, v in kwargs.items():
            setattr(self, k, v)

foo = OpenEndedObject(a=1, foo='bar')
assert foo.a == 1
assert foo.foo == 'bar'
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p><code>**kwargs</code> are good if you don't know in advance the name of the parameters. For example the <code>dict</code> constructor uses them to initialize the keys of the new dictionary. </p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>dict(**kwargs) -&gt; new dictionary initialized with the name=value pairs
    in the keyword argument list.  For example:  dict(one=1, two=2)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>In [3]: dict(one=1, two=2)
Out[3]: {'one': 1, 'two': 2}
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>And here's another typical example:</p>

<pre><code>MESSAGE = "Lo and behold! A message {message!r} came from {object_} with data {data!r}."

def proclaim(object_, message, data):
    print(MESSAGE.format(**locals()))
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>One example is implementing <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/277922/python-argument-binders">python-argument-binders</a>, used like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from functools import partial
&gt;&gt;&gt; def f(a, b):
...     return a+b
&gt;&gt;&gt; p = partial(f, 1, 2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; p()
3
&gt;&gt;&gt; p2 = partial(f, 1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; p2(7)
8
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This is from the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functools.html?highlight=functools#functools.partial" rel="nofollow">functools.partial</a> python docs:  partial is 'relatively equivalent' to this impl:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>def partial(func, *args, **keywords):
    def newfunc(*fargs, **fkeywords):
        newkeywords = keywords.copy()
        newkeywords.update(fkeywords)
        return func(*(args + fargs), **newkeywords)
    newfunc.func = func
    newfunc.args = args
    newfunc.keywords = keywords
    return newfunc
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Here's an example, I used in CGI Python.  I created a class that took <code>**kwargs</code> to the <code>__init__</code> function.  That allowed me to emulate the DOM on the server-side with classes:</p>

<pre><code>document = Document()
document.add_stylesheet('style.css')
document.append(Div(H1('Imagist\'s Page Title'), id = 'header'))
document.append(Div(id='body'))
</code></pre>

<p>The only problem is that you can't do the following, because <code>class</code> is a Python keyword.</p>

<pre><code>Div(class = 'foo')
</code></pre>

<p>The solution is to access the underlying dictionary.</p>

<pre><code>Div(**{'class':'foo'})
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not saying that this is a "correct" usage of the feature.  What I'm saying is that there are all kinds of unforseen ways in which features like this can be used.</p>
