<h3>Question (ID-4250342):</h3><h2>Generate all possible numpad/keypad sequences</h2><p>I am trying to generate all possible keypad sequences (7 digit length only right now). For example if the mobile keypad looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
  0
</code></pre>

<p>Some of the possible sequences can be:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>123698<br>
  147896<br>
  125698<br>
  789632</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The requirement is that the each digit of number should be neighbor of previous digit.</p>

<p>Here is how I am planning to start this:</p>

<p>The information about the neighbor changes from keypad to keypad so we have to hardcode it like this:</p>

<pre><code>neighbors = {0: 8, 1: [2,4], 2: [1,3,5], 3: [2,6], 4: [1,5,7], 5: [2,4,6,8], 6: [3,5,9], 7: [4,8], 8: [7,5,9,0], 9: [6,8]}
</code></pre>

<p>I will be traversing through all digits and will append one of the possible neighbors to it until required length is achieved.</p>

<p>EDIT: Updated neighbors, no diagonals allowed
EDIT 2: Digits can be reused</p>

<pre><code> neighbors = {0: [8], 
             1: [2,4], 
             2: [1,4,3], 
             3: [2,6], 
             4: [1,5,7], 
             5: [2,4,6,8], 
             6: [3,5,9], 
             7: [4,8], 
             8: [7,5,9,0], 
             9: [6,8]}


def get_sequences(n):
    if not n:
        return
    stack = [(i,) for i in  range(10)]
    while stack:
        cur = stack.pop()
        if len(cur) == n:
            yield cur
        else:
            stack.extend(cur + (d, ) for d in neighbors[cur[-1]]) 

print list(get_sequences(3))
</code></pre>

<p>This will produce all possible sequences. You didn't mention if you wanted ones that have cycles in them, for example <code>(0, 8, 9, 8)</code> so I left them in. If you don't want them, then just use</p>

<pre><code> stack.extend(cur + (d, ) 
              for d in neighbors[cur[-1]]
              if d not in cur)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I made the entry for <code>0</code> a list with one element instead of just an integer. This is for consistency. It's very nice be able to index into the dictionary and know that you're going to get a list back. </p>

<p>Also note that this isn't recursive. Recursive functions are <strong>great</strong> in languages that properly support them. In Python, you should almost always manage a stack like I demonstrate here. It's just as easy as a recursive solution and sidesteps function call overhead (python doesn't support tail recursion) and maximum recursion depth concerns.</p>

gen_neighbor_permutations(n=3, current_prefix='', available_digit_set=start_set)
</code></pre>

<p>I also couldn't help but notice that in your examples, none of the digits are reused. If you want that, then you would use the <code>unique_digits = True</code> option; this will disallow recursion on digits that are already used. </p>

<p>+1 What a fun puzzle. I hope this works for you!</p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Recursion isn't really much of an issue here because the sequence is relatively short as are the choices for each digit except the first -- so there appear to "only" be 4790 possibilities disallowing diagonals. This is written as an iterator to eliminate the need to create and return a large container with all possibilities produced in it. </p>

<p>It occurred to me that an additional benefit of the data-driven approach of storing the neighbor adjacency information in a data structure (as the OP suggested) was that besides easily supporting different keypads, it also makes controlling whether diagonals are allowed or not trivial. </p>

<p>I debated briefly about whether to make it a list instead of a dictionary for faster lookups, but realized that doing so would make it more difficult to adapt to produce sequences other than digits (and likely wouldn't make it significantly faster anyway).</p>

                yield seq
            else:
                for digits in next_level(i+1):
                    yield digits

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>That's a classic recursive algorithm.  Some pseudo code to show the concept:</p>

<pre><code>function(numbers) {

  } 
  if (numbers[last]=='1') {
