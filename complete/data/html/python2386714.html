<h3>Question (ID-2386714):</h3><h2>In python, why is "import *" bad?</h2><p>It is recommended to not to use <strong>import *</strong> in python. Can anyone <strong>please share the reason</strong> for that, so that I can avoid it doing next time.</p>

<p>Thanks and Regards</p>

<li><p>Because it puts a lot of stuff into your namespace (might shadow some other object from previous import and you won't know about it). </p></li>
<li><p>Because you don't know exactly what is imported and can't find place from what module certain thing was imported easily (readability). </p></li>
<li><p>Because you can't use cool tools like <code>pyflakes</code> to detect statically errors in your code.</p></li>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>According to the <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/" rel="nofollow">Python Zen</a>:</p>

<pre><code>Explicit is better than implicit.
</code></pre>

<p>... can't argue with that, surely?</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>That is because you are polluting the namespace. You will import all the funtions and classes in your own namespace, which may clash with the functions you define yourself.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I think using a qualified name is more clear for the maintenance task; you see on the code line itself where a function comes from, so you can check out the docs much more easily.</p>

<p>In module foo:</p>

<pre><code>def myFunc():
    print 1
</code></pre>

<p>In your code:</p>

<pre><code>from foo import *

def doThis():
    myFunc() # Which myFunc is called?

def myFunc():
    print 2
</code></pre>

  <p>Note that in general the practice of importing <code>*</code> from a module or package is frowned upon, since it often causes <strong>poorly readable code</strong>. </p>

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You don't pass **locals() to functions, do you?</p>

<p>Since Python lacks an "include" statement, <em>and</em> the self parameter is explicit, <em>and</em> scoping rules are quite simple, it's usually very easy to point a finger at a variable and tell where that object comes from -- without reading other modules and without any kind of IDE (which are limited in the way of introspection anyway, by the fact the language is very dynamic).</p>

<p>The import * breaks all that.</p>

<p>Also, it has a concrete possibility of hiding bugs.</p>

<pre><code>import os, sys, foo, sqlalchemy, mystuff
from bar import *
</code></pre>

<p>Now, if the bar module has any of the "os", "mystuff", etc... attributes, they will override the explicitly imported ones, and possibly point to very different things. Defining <code>__all__</code> in bar is often wise -- this states what will implicitly be imported - but still it's hard to trace where objects come from, without reading and parsing the bar module and following <em>its</em> imports. A network of import * is the first thing I fix when I take ownership of a project.</p>

<p>Don't misunderstand me: if the import * were missing, I would cry to have it. But it has to be used carefully. A good use case is to provide a facade interface over another module.
Likewise, the use of conditional import statements, or imports inside function/class namespaces, requires a bit of discipline.</p>

<p>I think in medium-to-big projects, or small ones with several contributors, a minimum of hygiene is needed in terms of statical analysis -- running at least pyflakes or even better a properly configured pylint -- to catch several kind of bugs before they happen.</p>

<p>Of course since this is python -- feel free to break rules, and to explore -- but be wary of projects that could grow tenfold, if the source code is missing discipline it will be a problem.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>say you have the following code in a module called foo:</p>

<pre><code>import ElementTree as etree
</code></pre>

<p>and then in your own module you have:</p>

<pre><code>from lxml import etree
from foo import *
</code></pre>

<p>You now have a difficult-to-debug module that <em>looks like</em> it has lxml's etree in it, but really has ElementTree instead.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>It is OK to do <code>from ... import *</code> in an interactive session.</p>
