<h3>Question (ID-196924):</h3><h2>How to ensure user submit only english text</h2><p>I am building a project involving natural language processing, since the nlp module currently only deal with english text, so I have to make sure the user submitted content (not long, only several words) is in english. Are there established ways to achieve this? Python or Javascript way preferred.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-10):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>If the content is long enough I would suggest some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_analysis" rel="nofollow">frequency analysis</a> on the letters. </p>

<p>But for a few words I think your best bet is to compare them to an English dictionary and accept the input if half of them match.</p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I think the most effective way would be to ask the users to submit english text only :)</p>

<p>You can show a language selection drop-down over your text area with English/ Other as the options. When user selects "Other",  disable the text area with a message that only English language is supported [at the moment].</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Google has a javascript API that has an implementation of language detection.  I've only play tested with it, never used it in production.</p>

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Try n-gram based statistical language recognition. This is a <a href="http://odur.let.rug.nl/~vannoord/TextCat/Demo/" rel="nofollow">link</a> to a demo of an algorithm using this technique, there is also a link to a paper describing the algorithm there. Try the demo, it performs quite well even on very short texts (3-4 words).</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You are already doing NLP, if your module doesn't understand what language the text was then either the module doesn't work or the input was not in the correct language.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Try:</p>

<p><a href="http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/</a></p>

<p>For a list of English words.</p>

<p>You will need to be careful of names, e.g. "Canberra" or "Bill Clinton". These won't appear in the word list. I suggest just checking whether the first letter is capitalized as a first attempt.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>You could break the phrase up into words and check a dictionary (there are some that you can download, <a href="http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">this</a> may be of interest), but that would require that the dictionary you used was good enough.</p>

<p>It would also fall over for proper nouns (my name isn't in the dictionary for example).</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>The <a href="http://en.design-noir.de/mozilla/dictionary-switcher/" rel="nofollow" title="Dictionary Switcher">Dictionary Switcher</a> Firefox extensions has an option to detect the right dictionary as I type.<br />
I guess it checks words against the installed dictionaries, and selects the one giving the less errors...</p>

<p>You can't expect all words of the text to be in the dictionary: abbreviations, proper nouns, typos... Beside, some words are common to several languages: a French rock group even made the titles of their disks to have a (different) meaning both in French and in English. So it is a statistical thing: if more than x% of words are found in a good English dictionary, chances are the user types in this language (even if there are mistakes, like probably in this answer, since I am not native English).</p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>Maybe "<a href="http://valums.com/a/" rel="nofollow">Ensuring that the user submits only English text [PHP]</a>" article will help you. The code is written in PHP, but is small enough to be easily rewritten.</p>
