<h3>Question (ID-64237):</h3><h2>When to create a new app (with startapp) in Django?</h2><p>I've googled around for this, but I still have trouble relating to what Django defines as "apps". </p>

<p>Should I create a new app for each piece of functionality in a site, even though it uses models from the main project? </p>

<p>Do you guys have good rule of thumb of when to split off a new app, and when to keep functionality together with the "main project" or other apps?</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I prefer to think of Django applications as reusable modules or components than as "applications". </p>

<p>This helps me encapsulate and decouple certain features from one another, improving re-usability should I decide to share a particular "app" with the community at large, and maintainability.</p>

<p>My general approach is to bucket up specific features or feature sets into "apps" as though I were going to release them publicly. The hard part here is figuring out how big each bucket is. </p>

<p>A good trick I use is to imagine how my apps would be used if they were released publicly. This often encourages me to shrink the buckets and more clearly define its "purpose".</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>The rule I follow is it should be a new app if I want to reuse the functionality in a different project.</p>

<p>If it needs deep understanding of the models in your project, it's probably more cohesive to stick it with the models.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I tend to create new applications for each logically separate set of models. e.g.:</p>

<ul>
<li>User Profiles</li>
<li>Forum Posts</li>
<li>Blog posts</li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>An 'app' could be many different things, it all really comes down to taste. For example, let's say you are building a blog. Your app could be the entire blog, or you could have an 'admin' app, a 'site' app for all of the public views, an 'rss' app, a 'services' app so developers can interface with the blog in their own ways, etc.</p>

<p>I personally would make the blog itself the app, and break out the functionality within it. The blog could then be reused rather easily in other websites.</p>

<p>The nice thing about Django is that it will recognize any models.py file within any level of your directory tree as a file containing Django models. So breaking your functionality out into smaller 'sub apps' within an 'app' itself won't make anything more difficult.</p>

  <h2>Taken from the slide</h2>
  
  <p>Should this be its own application?</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Is it completely unrelated to the app’s focus?</li>
  <li>Is it orthogonal to whatever else I’m doing?</li>
  <li>Will I need similar functionality on other sites?</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>If any of them is "Yes"? Then best to break it into a 
  separate application.</p>
