<h3>Question (ID-956104):</h3><h2>Is there a static analysis tool for Python, Ruby, Sql, Cobol, Perl, and PL/SQL?</h2><p>I am looking for a static analysis tool for Python, Ruby, Sql, Cobol, Perl, PL/SQL, SQL similar to find bugs and check style. I am looking for calculating the line count, identify bugs during the development, and enforcing coding standard.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I use <a href="http://pychecker.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">PyChecker</a> and <a href="http://www.logilab.org/project/pylint" rel="nofollow">pylint</a> as Python code checkers. However it seems that they get buggy when you use some modules (e.g., <code>socket</code> or <code>pygame</code>, IIRC).</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>For Ruby, you're probably best served looking at this previous SO question:</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/286564">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/286564/can-anyone-recommend-a-ruby-source-code-analyzer-something-like-pylint</a></p>

<p>which seems pretty thorough.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I use Pylint for Python which was nicely <a href="http://mysite.verizon.net/bcorfman/2007/02/komodo-hacks-integrating-pylint.html" rel="nofollow">integrated into Komodo by Brandon Corfman</a> (if ActiveState's Komodo is your thing).</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Sonar has a <a href="http://www.sonarsource.com/plugins/" rel="nofollow">PL/SQL plugin</a> that is based on Toad CodeXpert code analyzer.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>See various static analysis tools from <a href="http://www.semanticdesigns.com" rel="nofollow">Semantic 
Designs</a>.</p>

<p>These cover standard metrics for Java, C# and COBOL.   There are also tools to detect duplicate code (clones) for many languages, including Python, Java, PL/SQL (from your list).</p>

<p>Finally, there is a style checker (coding standards checks) for COBOL (with optional Eclipse plugin) that offers refactoring support to fix some of the style errors.</p>
