<h3>Question (ID-141642):</h3><h2>What limitations have closures in Python compared to language X closures?</h2><p>Where X is any programming language (C#, Javascript, Lisp, Perl, Ruby, Scheme, etc) which supports some flavour of closures.  </p>

<p>Some limitations are mentioned in the <a href="http://ivan.truemesh.com/archives/000411.html" rel="nofollow">Closures in Python</a> (compared to Ruby's closures), but the article is old and many limitations do not exist in modern Python any more.</p>

<p>Seeing a code example for a concrete limitation would be great.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def outer(x): 
...     def inner_reads():
...         # Will return outer's 'x'.
...         return x
...     def inner_writes(y):
...         # Will assign to a local 'x', not the outer 'x'
...         x = y
...     def inner_error(y):
...         # Will produce an error: 'x' is local because of the assignment,
...         # but we use it before it is assigned to.
...         tmp = x
...         x = y
...         return tmp
...     return inner_reads, inner_writes, inner_error
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; inner_reads, inner_writes, inner_error = outer(5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; inner_reads()
5
&gt;&gt;&gt; inner_writes(10)
&gt;&gt;&gt; inner_reads()
5
&gt;&gt;&gt; inner_error(10)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 11, in inner_error
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'x' referenced before assignment
</code></pre>

<p>A name that gets assigned to in a local scope (a function) is always local, unless declared otherwise. While there is the 'global' declaration to declare a variable global even when it is assigned to, there is no such declaration for enclosed variables -- yet. In Python 3.0, there is (will be) the 'nonlocal' declaration that does just that.</p>

<p>You can work around this limitation in the mean time by using a mutable container type:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def outer(x):
...     x = [x]
...     def inner_reads():
...         # Will return outer's x's first (and only) element.
...         return x[0]
...     def inner_writes(y):
...         # Will look up outer's x, then mutate it.      
...         x[0] = y
...     def inner_error(y):
...         # Will now work, because 'x' is not assigned to, just referenced.
...         tmp = x[0]
...         x[0] = y
...         return tmp
...     return inner_reads, inner_writes, inner_error
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; inner_reads, inner_writes, inner_error = outer(5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; inner_reads()
5
&gt;&gt;&gt; inner_writes(10)
&gt;&gt;&gt; inner_reads()
10
&gt;&gt;&gt; inner_error(15)
10
&gt;&gt;&gt; inner_reads()
15

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The only difficulty I've seen people encounter with Python's in particular is when they try to mix non-functional features like variable reassignment with closures, and are surprised when this doesn't work:</p>

<pre><code>def outer ():
    x = 1
    def inner ():
        print x
        x = 2
    return inner
outer () ()
</code></pre>

<p>Usually just pointing out that a function has its own local variables is enough to deter such silliness.</p>

<p><code>nonlocal</code> does not solves completely this problem:</p>

<pre><code>x = 0 # global x
def outer():
    x = 1 # local to `outer`
    def inner():
        global x
        x = 2 # change global
        print(x) 
        x = 3 # change global
        return x
    def inner2():
##        nonlocal x # can't use `nonlocal` here
        print(x)     # prints global
##        x = 4      # can't change `x` here
        return x
    x = 5
    return (inner, inner2)

for inner in outer():
    print(inner())
# -&gt; 2 3 3 3
</code></pre>

<p>On the other hand:</p>

<pre><code>x = 0
def outer():
    x = 1 # local to `outer`
    def inner():
##        global x
        x = 2
        print(x) # local to `inner` 
        x = 3 
        return x
    def inner2():
        nonlocal x
        print(x)
        x = 4  # local to `outer`
        return x
    x = 5
    return (inner, inner2)

for inner in outer():
    print(inner())
# -&gt; 2 3 5 4

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Fixed in Python 3.0 via the <strong>nonlocal</strong> keyword. See <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=208549" rel="nofollow">here </a>and search for "nonlocal".<br><br>For those of you who don't like using the web: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The nonlocal statement lets you assign to variables in outer (non-global) scopes.<br>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>A limitation (or "limitation") of Python closures, comparing to Javascript closures, is that it <strong>cannot</strong> be used for effective <strong>data hiding</strong></p>

<h3>Javascript</h3>

<pre><code>var mksecretmaker = function(){
    var secrets = [];
    var mksecret = function() {
        secrets.push(Math.random())
    }
    return mksecret
}
var secretmaker = mksecretmaker();
secretmaker(); secretmaker()
// privately generated secret number list
// is practically inaccessible
</code></pre>

<h3>Python</h3>

<pre><code>import random
def mksecretmaker():
    secrets = []
    def mksecret():
        secrets.append(random.random())
    return mksecret

secretmaker = mksecretmaker()
secretmaker(); secretmaker()
# "secrets" are easily accessible,
# it's difficult to hide something in Python:
secretmaker.__closure__[0].cell_contents # -&gt; e.g. [0.680752847190161, 0.9068475951742101]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>The better workaround until 3.0 is to include the variable as a defaulted parameter in the enclosed function definition:</p>

<pre>
def f()
    x = 5
    def g(y, z, x=x):
        x = x + 1
</pre>
