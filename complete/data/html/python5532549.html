<h3>Question (ID-5532549):</h3><h2>notepad++ & python</h2><p>Ive been googling lots and this is getting really frustrating. It doesn't act like idle. </p>

<pre><code>Example
else:  
    name = 'World'
    print 'Howdy', name
    print 'yay'
</code></pre>

<p>but in notepad++ </p>

<pre><code>else: # i press enter and this is what it does
lands me here
</code></pre>

<p>But i want to be able to do like in idle after the : i can just press enter and keep on going. My English isn't that great.</p>

<p>I have my filetype set to python etc and my format to unix.</p>

<p>Sometimes people ask, "How can I do x in program y?"</p>

<p>I have a dream that one day "Use program z instead" will not be the most popular response.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Editra (http://editra.org/) has the feature you're looking for.  I'm in a course where it is being used to introduce people to Python, and it works really well.  It has some other nice robust features as well, such as being able to minimize parts of the code that you don't want to read at the moment so you can focus on the important parts of your file.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I played a bit with python in Notepad++ and I had a problem with the tab. 
Since in python you indentation is really important notepad ++ put space instead of a tab.</p>

<p>So to change that you can go in notepad ++ 
preference -> select "language menu tab and setting" tab 
Then select python in the "tab setting" box and select replace tab by space. </p>

<p>Like the other answer, you might want to consider another ide.
I personally use eclipse with the pydev plugin and django plungin.
Erik is nice too. </p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>A better ide might be spyder. <a href="http://code.google.com/p/spyderlib/" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/spyderlib/</a> its about the best IDE I have found.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.geany.org/" rel="nofollow">Geany</a> is a fast and light-weight cross-platform IDE, it supports auto-completion and auto-identation for python code, execute run your program , integrated console , plus has a <a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3060/2957275673_1d839bc61b_o.png" rel="nofollow">symbol list</a> side pannel that lets you visualize and browse you code easily, you can jump directly to function definitions and the likes using the context menu, plus it's open source</p>

<p>How ever for a full fledged IDE i would recommand <a href="http://eric-ide.python-projects.org/" rel="nofollow">Eric4</a></p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I've found Notepad++ to live up to the task of being a better basic text editor than Notepad, but it isn't really designed to be as smart as a proper programming IDE.</p>

<p>It might be possible to get it to do what you're asking for, but I certainly don't know how to set it up that way.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Emacs has python-mode which (also) does it. Grab it and prepare for life-time enjoyment.</p>
