<h3>Question (ID-5767987):</h3><h2>python re.compile strings with vars and numbers</h2><p>Hi I want to get a match for the following:</p>

<p><code>test = re.compile(r' [0-12](am|pm) [1-1000] days from (yesterday|today|tomorrow)')</code></p>

<p>with this match:</p>

<p><code>print test.match(" 3pm 2 days from today")</code></p>

<p>It returns none, what am i doing wrong? I am just getting into regex and reading the docs I thought this should work! ANY HELP APPRECIATED

<p>This regex illustrates a few lessons to be learned:</p>

<ul>
<li>Regular expressions are very powerful (and useful)!</li>
<li>This regex does validate the numbers, but as you can see, doing so is cumbersome and difficult (and thus, not recommended - I'm showing it here to demonstrate why not to do it this way). It is much easier to simply capture the numbers with a regex then validate the ranges using procedural code.</li>
<li>Named capture groups ease the pain of plucking multiple data sub-strings from larger text.</li>
<li>Always write regexes using free-spacing, verbose mode with proper indentation of groups and lots of descriptive comments. This helps while writing the regex and later during maintenance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Modern regular expressions comprise a rich and powerful language. Once you <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/" rel="nofollow" title="An excellent regex reference site written by Jan Goyvaerts">learn the syntax</a> and develop a habit of writing verbose, properly indented, well-commented code, then even complex regexes such as the one above are easy to write, easy to read and are easy to maintain. It is unfortunate that they have acquired a reputation for being difficult, unwieldy and error-prone (and thus not recommendable for complex tasks).</p>

<p>Happy regexing!</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>what about</p>

<pre><code>test = re.compile(r' ([0-9]|1[012])(am|pm) \d+ days from (yesterday|today|tomorrow)')
</code></pre>

<p>the hours part should match 0, 1, ..., 9 or 10, 11, 12
but not 13, 14, ..., 19.</p>

<p>you can limit days part in similar way for 1, ..., 1000, i.e. (1000|\d{1,3}).</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Try this:</p>

<pre><code>import re

test = re.compile('^\s[0-1]?[0-9]{1}pm \d+ days from (today|yesterday|tomorrow)$')

print test.match(" 12pm 2 days from today")
</code></pre>

<p>The problem that you're having is that you can't specify multiple digit numeric ranges in regex (afaik), so you have to treat them as individual characters.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://codepad.org/qMQLn3Ud" rel="nofollow">Sample here</a></strong></p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Try this:</p>

<pre><code>test = re.compile(' \d+(am|pm) \d+ days from (yesterday|today|tomorrow)')
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>If you want to extract the parts of the match individually, you can label the groups with <code>(?P&lt;name&gt;[match])</code>.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>import re

pattern = re.compile(
    r'\s*(?P&lt;time&gt;1?[0-9])(?P&lt;ampm&gt;am|pm)\s+'
    r'(?P&lt;days&gt;[1-9]\d*)\s+days\s+from\s+'
    r'(?P&lt;when&gt;yesterday|today|tomorrow)\s*')

for time in range(0, 13):
    for ampm in ('am', 'pm'):
        for days in range(1, 1000):
            for when in ('yesterday', 'today', 'tomorrow'):
                text = ' %d%s %d days from %s ' % (time, ampm, days, when)
                match = pattern.match(text)
                assert match is not None
                keys = sorted(match.groupdict().keys())
                assert keys == ['ampm', 'days', 'time', 'when']

text = ' 3pm 2 days from today '
print pattern.match(text).groupdict()
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>{'time': '3', 'when': 'today', 'days': '2', 'ampm': 'pm'}
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><pre><code>test = re.compile(' 1?\d[ap]m \d{1,3} days? from (?:yesterday|today|tomorrow)')
</code></pre>

<h2>EDIT</h2>

<p>Having read the discussion between Rumple Stiltskin and Demian Brecht, I noticed that my above proposition is poor because it detects a certain structure of string, but it doesn't validate precisely it is a good "time-pattern" string, because it can detect " 18pm 2 days from today" for exemple.</p>

<p>So I propose now a pattern that allows to detect precisely a string verifying your requirement and that points out every string having the same structure as a valid one but not with the required values of a valid good "time-pattern" string:</p>

<pre><code>import re

regx = re.compile("(?&lt;= )"  # better than a blank as first character
                  ""
                  "(?:(1[012]|\d)([ap]m) (?!0 )(\d{1,3}|1000)"
                  "|"
                  "(\d+)([ap]m) (\d+))"
                  ""
                  " days? from (yesterday|today|tomorrow)") # shared part




for ch in (" 12pm 2 days from today",
           " 4pm 1 day from today",
           " 12pm 0 days from today",
           " 12pm 1001 days from today",
           " 18pm 2 days from today",
           " 1212pm 2 days from today",
           " 12pm five days from today"):

    print ch
    mat = regx.search(ch)
    if mat:
        if mat.group(1):
            print mat.group(1,2,3,7),'\n# time-pattern-VALIDATED string #'
        else:
            print mat.group(4,5,6,7),'\n* SIMILI-time-pattern STRUCTURED string*'
    else:
        print '- NO STRUCTURED STRING in the text -'
    print
</code></pre>

<p>result</p>

<pre><code> 12pm 2 days from today
('12', 'pm', '2', 'today') 
# time-pattern-VALIDATED string #

 4pm 1 day from today
('4', 'pm', '1', 'today') 
# time-pattern-VALIDATED string #

 12pm 0 days from today
('12', 'pm', '0', 'today') 
* SIMILI-time-pattern STRUCTURED string*

 12pm 1001 days from today
('12', 'pm', '1001', 'today') 
* SIMILI-time-pattern STRUCTURED string*

 18pm 2 days from today
('18', 'pm', '2', 'today') 
* SIMILI-time-pattern STRUCTURED string*

 1212pm 2 days from today
('1212', 'pm', '2', 'today') 
* SIMILI-time-pattern STRUCTURED string*

 12pm five days from today
- NO STRUCTURED STRING in the text -
</code></pre>

<p>If you need only a regex that detects a time-pattern validated string, you use only</p>

<pre><code>regx = re.compile("(?&lt;= )(1[012]|\d)([ap]m) (?!0 )(\d{1,3}|1000) days?"
                  " from (yesterday|today|tomorrow)")
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>It is easier (and more readable) to check integer ranges after the match:</p>

<pre><code>m = re.match(r' (\d+)(?:pm|am) (\d+) days from (yesterday|today|tomorrow)',
             " 3pm 2 days from today")
assert m and int(m.group(1)) &lt;= 12 and 1 &lt;= int(m.group(2)) &lt;= 1000
</code></pre>

<p>Or you could use an existing library e.g., <a href="https://code.google.com/p/parsedatetime/" rel="nofollow"><code>pip install parsedatetime</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>import parsedatetime.parsedatetime as pdt

cal = pdt.Calendar()
print cal.parse("3pm 2 days from today")
</code></pre>

<h3>Output</h3>

<pre><code>((2011, 4, 26, 15, 0, 0, 1, 116, -1), 3)
