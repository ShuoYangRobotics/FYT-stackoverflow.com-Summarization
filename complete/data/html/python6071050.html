<h3>Question (ID-6071050):</h3><h2>Python: How to tell the for loop to continue from a function?</h2><p>Sometimes I need the following pattern within a <code>for</code> loop. At times more than once in the same loop:</p>

<pre><code>    try:
        var = 'attempt to do something that may fail on a number of levels'
    except Exception, e:
        log(e)
        continue
</code></pre>

<p>Now I don't see a nice way to wrap this in a function as it can not <code>return continue</code>:</p>

<pre><code>def attempt(this):
    try:
        return this
    except Exception, e:
        log(e)
        # 1. continue # &lt;-- syntax error: continue not properly in loop or
        # 2. return continue # &lt;-- invalid syntax
        # 3.
        return False # &lt;-- this sort of works, but makes me feel powerless
</code></pre>

<p>If I <code>return False</code> than I could:</p>

<pre><code>    var = attempt('to do something that may fail on a number of levels')
    if not var:
        continue
</code></pre>

<p>But I don't feel that does it the justice. I want to tell the for loop to <code>continue</code> (or fake it) from within <code>attempt</code> function.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Python already has a very nice construct for doing just this and it doesn't use <code>continue</code>:</p>

<pre><code>for i in range(10):
    try:
        r = 1.0 / (i % 2)
    except Exception, e:
        print(e)
    else:
        print(r)
</code></pre>

<p>I wouldn't nest any more than this, though, or your code will soon get very ugly.</p>

<p>In your case I would probably do something more like this as it is far easier to unit test the individual functions and <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/" rel="nofollow">flat is better than nested</a>:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python

def something_that_may_raise(i):
    return 1.0 / (i % 2)

def handle(e):
    print("Exception: " + str(e))

def do_something_with(result):
    print("No exception: " + str(result))

def wrap_process(i):
    try:
        result = something_that_may_raise(i)
    except ZeroDivisionError, e:
        handle(e)
    except OverflowError, e:
        handle(e) # Realistically, this will be a different handler...
    else:
        do_something_with(result)

for i in range(10):
    wrap_process(i)
</code></pre>

<p>Remember to always <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/HandlingExceptions" rel="nofollow">catch <em>specific</em> exceptions</a>. If you were not expecting a <em>specific</em> exception to be thrown, it is probably not safe to continue with your processing loop.</p>

<h2>Edit following comments:</h2>

<p>If you really don't want to handle the exceptions, which I still think is a bad idea, then catch all exceptions (<code>except:</code>) and instead of <code>handle(e)</code>, just <code>pass</code>. At this point <code>wrap_process()</code> will end, skipping the <code>else:</code>-block where the real work is done, and you'll go to the next iteration of your <code>for</code>-loop.</p>

<p>Bear in mind, <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/" rel="nofollow">Errors should never pass silently</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Maybe you want to do continuations? You could go and look at how <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2010/10/21/continuation-passing-style-revisited-part-one.aspx" rel="nofollow">Eric Lippert explains them</a> (if you are ready to have your mind blown, but in Python it could look a bit like this:</p>

<pre><code>def attempt(operation, continuation):
    try:
        operation()
    except:
        log('operation failed!')
    continuation()
</code></pre>

<p>Inside your loop you could do:</p>

<pre><code>attempt(attempt_something, lambda: foo(bar)) # attempt_something is a function
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Think that you are mapping <code>foo</code> on all items where <code>attempt</code> worked. So <code>attempt</code> is a filter and it's easy to write this as a generator:</p>

<pre><code>def attempted( items ):
    for item in items:
        try:
            yield attempt( item )
        except Exception, e:
            log(e)

print [foo(bar) for bar in attempted( items )]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You could use this:</p>

<pre><code>for l in loop:
  attempt() and foo(bar)
</code></pre>

<p>but you should make sure attempt() returns True or False.</p>

<p>Really, though, Johnsyweb's answer is probably better.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>The whole idea of exceptions is that they work across multiple levels of indirection, i.e., if you have an error (or any other <em>exceptional</em> state) deep inside your call hierarchy, you can still catch it on a higher level and handle it properly.</p>

<p>In your case, say you have a function attempt() which calls the functions attempt2() and attempt3() down the call hierarchy, and attempt3() may encounter an exceptional state which should cause the main loop to terminate:</p>

<pre><code>class JustContinueException(Exception):
    pass

for i in range(0,99):
    try:
        var = attempt() # calls attempt2() and attempt3() in turn
    except JustContinueException:
        continue # we don't need to log anything here
    except Exception, e:
        log(e)
        continue

    foo(bar)

def attempt3():
    try:
        # do something
    except Exception, e:
        # do something with e, if needed
        raise # reraise exception, so we catch it downstream
</code></pre>

<p>You can even throw a dummy exception yourself, that would just cause the loop to terminate, and wouldn't even be logged.</p>

<pre><code>def attempt3():
    raise JustContinueException()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I wouldn't normally post a second answer, but this is an alternative approach if you really don't like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6071050/python-how-to-tell-the-for-loop-to-continue-from-a-function/6071174#6071174">my first answer</a>.</p>

<p>Remember that a function can return a <code>tuple</code>.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python

def something_that_mail_fail(i):
    failed = False
    result = None
    try:
        result = 1.0 / (i % 4)
    except:
        failed = True # But we don't care
    return failed, result

for i in range(20):
    failed, result = something_that_mail_fail(i)
    if failed:
        continue
    for rah in ['rah'] * 3:
        print(rah)
    print(result)
</code></pre>

<p>I maintain that <code>try ... except ... else</code> is the way to go, and you shouldn't silently ignore errors though. <em>Caveat emptor</em> and all that.</p>
