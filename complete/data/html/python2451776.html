<h3>Question (ID-2451776):</h3><h2>working with negative numbers in python</h2><p>Thank you for your help in advance. I am a student in a concepts of programming class. The lab is run by a TA and today in lab he gave us a real simple little program to build. It was one where it would multiply by addition. Anyway, he had us use absolute to avoid breaking the prog with negatives. I whipped it up real quick and then argued with him for 10 minutes that it was bad math. It was, 4 * -5 does not equal 20, it equals -20. He said that he really dosen't care about that and that it would be too hard to make the prog handle the negatives anyway. So my question is how do I go about this.</p>

<p>here is the prog I turned in:</p>

<pre><code>#get user input of numbers as variables

numa, numb = input("please give 2 numbers to multiply seperated with a comma:")

#standing variables
total = 0
count = 0

#output the total
while (count&lt; abs(numb)):
    total = total + numa
    count = count + 1

#testing statements
if (numa, numb &lt;= 0):
    print abs(total)
else:
    print total
</code></pre>

<p>I want to do it without absolutes, but every time I input negative numbers I get a big fat goosegg. I know there is some simple way to do it, I just can't find it. </p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Too hard? Your TA is... well, the phrase would probably get me banned. Anyways, check to see if <code>numb</code> is negative. If it is then multiply <code>numa</code> by <code>-1</code> and do <code>numb = abs(numb)</code>. Then do the loop.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The abs() in the while condition is needed, since, well, it controls the number of iterations (how would you define a negative number of iterations?). You can correct it by inverting the sign of the result if <code>numb</code> is negative.</p>

<p>So this is the modified version of your code. Note I replaced the while loop with a cleaner for loop.</p>

<pre><code>#get user input of numbers as variables
numa, numb = input("please give 2 numbers to multiply seperated with a comma:")

#standing variables
total = 0

#output the total
for count in range(abs(numb)):
    total += numa

if numb &lt; 0:
    total = -total

print total
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Perhaps you would accomplish this with something to the effect of</p>

<pre><code>text = raw_input("please give 2 numbers to multiply separated with a comma:")
split_text = text.split(',')
a = int(split_text[0])
b = int(split_text[1])
# The last three lines could be written: a, b = map(int, text.split(','))
# but you may find the code I used a bit easier to understand for now.

if b &gt; 0:
    num_times = b
else:
    num_times = -b

total = 0
# While loops with counters basically should not be used, so I replaced the loop 
# with a for loop. Using a while loop at all is rare.
for i in xrange(num_times):
    total += a 
    # We do this a times, giving us total == a * abs(b)

if b &lt; 0:
    # If b is negative, adjust the total to reflect this.
    total = -total

print total
</code></pre>

<p>or maybe</p>

<pre><code>a * b
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Try this on your TA:</p>

<pre><code># Simulate multiplying two N-bit two's-complement numbers
# into a 2N-bit accumulator
# Use shift-add so that it's O(base_2_log(N)) not O(N)

for numa, numb in ((3, 5), (-3, 5), (3, -5), (-3, -5), (-127, -127)):
    print numa, numb,
    accum = 0
    negate = False
    if numa &lt; 0:
        negate = True
        numa = -numa
    while numa:
        if numa &amp; 1:
            accum += numb
        numa &gt;&gt;= 1
        numb &lt;&lt;= 1
    if negate:
        accum = -accum
    print accum
</code></pre>

<p>output:</p>

<pre><code>3 5 15
-3 5 -15
3 -5 -15
-3 -5 15
-127 -127 16129
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>How about something like that?  (Uses no abs() nor mulitiplication)<br>
Notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>the abs() function is only used for the optimization trick. This snippet can either be removed or recoded.</li>
<li>the logic is less efficient since we're testing the sign of a and b with each iteration (price to pay to avoid both abs() and multiplication operator)</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<pre><code>def multiply_by_addition(a, b):
""" School exercise: multiplies integers a and b, by successive additions.
"""
   if abs(a) &gt; abs(b):
      a, b = b, a     # optimize by reducing number of iterations
   total = 0
   while a != 0:
      if a &gt; 0:
         a -= 1
         total += b
      else:
         a += 1
         total -= b
   return total

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Thanks everyone, you all helped me learn a lot. This is what I came up with using some of your suggestions</p>

<pre><code>#this is apparently a better way of getting multiple inputs at the same time than the 
#way I was doing it
text = raw_input("please give 2 numbers to multiply separated with a comma:")
split_text = text.split(',')
numa = int(split_text[0])
numb = int(split_text[1])

#standing variables
total = 0

if numb &gt; 0:
    repeat = numb
else:
    repeat = -numb

#for loops work better than while loops and are cheaper
#output the total
for count in range(repeat):
    total += numa


#check to make sure the output is accurate
if numb &lt; 0:
    total = -total


print total
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks for all the help everyone.</p>
