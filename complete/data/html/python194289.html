<h3>Question (ID-194289):</h3><h2>Recommended data format for describing the rules of chess</h2><p>I'm going to be writing a chess server and one or more clients for chess and I want to describe the rules of chess (e.g. allowable moves based on game state, rules for when a game is complete) in a programming language independant way. This is a bit tricky since some of the chess rules (e.g. King Castling, en passent, draws based on 3 or more repeated moves) are based not only on the board layout but also on the history of moves.</p>

<p>I would prefer the format to be:</p>

<ul>
<li>textual</li>
<li>human readable</li>
<li>based on a standard (e.g. YAML, XML)</li>
<li>easily parsable in a variety of languages</li>
</ul>

<p>But I am willing to sacrifice any of these for a suitable solution.</p>

<p>My main question is: How can I build algorithms of such a complexity that operate on such complex state from a data format?</p>

<p>A followup queston is: Can you provide an example of a similar problem solved in a similar manner that can act as a starting point?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> In response to a request for clarity -- consider that I will have a server written in Python, one client written in C# and another client written in Java. I would like to avoid specifying the rules (e.g. for allowable piece movement, circumstances for check, etc.) in each place. I would prefer to specify these rules once in a language independant manner.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-9):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Let's think.  We're describing objects (locations and pieces) with states and behaviors.  We need to note a current state and an ever-changing set of allowed state changes from a current state.</p>

<p>This is programming.  You don't want some "meta-language" that you can then parse in a regular programming language.  Just use a programming language.</p>

<p>Start with ordinary class definitions in an ordinary language.  Get it all to work.  Then, those class definitions are the definition of chess.  </p>

<p>With only miniscule exceptions, <strong>all</strong> programming languages are</p>

<ul>
<li>Textual</li>
<li>Human readable</li>
<li>Reasonably standardized</li>
<li>Easily parsed by their respective compilers or interpreters.</li>
</ul>

<p>Just pick a language, and you're done.  Since it will take a while to work out the nuances, you'll probably be happier with a dynamic language like Python or Ruby than with a static language like Java or C#.</p>

<p>If you want portability.  Pick a portable language.  If you want the language embedded in a "larger" application, then, pick the language for your "larger" application.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>Since the original requirements were incomplete, a secondary minor issue is how to have code that runs in conjunction with multiple clients.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Don't have clients in multiple languages.  Pick one.  Java, for example, and stick with it.  </p></li>
<li><p>If you must have clients in multiple languages, then you need a language you can embed in all three language run-time environments.  You have two choices.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Embed an interpreter.  For example Python, Tcl and JavaScript are lightweight interpreters that you can call from C or C# programs.  This approach works for browsers, it can work for you.  Java, via JNI can make use of this, also.  There are BPEL rules engines that you can try this with.</p></li>
<li><p>Spawn an interpreter as a separate subprocess.  Open a named pipe or socket or something between your app and your spawned interpreter.  Your Java and C# clients can talk with a Python subprocess.  Your Python server can simply use this code.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><strong>Edit:</strong> Overly wordy answer deleted.</p>

<p>The short answer is, write the rules in Python. Use Iron Python to interface that to the C# client, and Jython for the Java client.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>This is answering the followup question :-)</p>

<p>I can point out that one of the most popular chess servers around documents its protocol <a href="ftp://ftp.chessclub.com/pub/icc/formats/formats.txt" rel="nofollow">here</a> (Warning, FTP link, and does not support passive FTP), but <strong>only to write interfaces to it</strong>, not for any other purpose. You could start writing a client for this server as a learning experience.</p>

<p>One thing that's relevant is that good chess servers offer many more features than just a move relay.</p>

<p>That said, there is a more basic protocol used to interface to chess engines, documented <a href="http://www.tim-mann.org/xboard/engine-intf.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>Oh, and by the way: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_representation_%28chess%29" rel="nofollow">Board Representation at Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>Anything beyond board representation belongs to the program itself, as many have already pointed out.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>There's already a widely used format specific to chess called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation" rel="nofollow">Portable Game Notation</a>.  There's also <a href="http://www.red-bean.com/sgf/" rel="nofollow">Smart Game Format</a>, which is adaptable to many different games.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I would suggest Prolog for describing the rules. </p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>What I've gathered from the responses so far:</p>

<p><strong>For chess board data representations:</strong></p>

<p>See the Wikipedia article on [chess board representations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_representation_(chess)).</p>

<p><strong>For chess move data representations:</strong></p>

<p>See the Wikipedia articles on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation" rel="nofollow">Portable Game Notation</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_chess_notation" rel="nofollow">Algebraic Chess Notation</a></p>

<p><strong>For chess rules representations:</strong></p>

<p>This must be done using a programming language. If one wants to reduce the amount of code written in the case where the rules will be implemented in more than one language then there are a few options</p>

<ol>
<li>Use a language where an embedable interpreter exists for the target languages (e.g. Lua, Python).</li>
<li>Use a Virtual Machine that the common languages can compile to (e.g. IronPython for C#, JPython for Java).</li>
<li>Use a background daemon or sub-process for the rules with which the target languages can communicate.</li>
<li>Reimplement the rules algorithms in each target language.</li>
</ol>

<p>Although I would have liked a declarative syntax that could have been interpreted by mutliple languages to enforce the rules of chess my research has lead me to no likely candidate. I have a suspicion that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_programming" rel="nofollow">Constraint Based Programming</a> may be a possible route given that solvers exist for many languages but I am not sure they would truly fulfill this requirement. Thanks for all the attention and perhaps in the future an answer will appear.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Drools has a modern human readable rules implementation -- https://www.jboss.org/drools/.
They have a way users can enter their rules in Excel. A lot more users can understand what is in Excel than in other tools.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>To represent the current state of a board (including castling possibilities etc) you can use 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth-Edwards_Notation" rel="nofollow">Forsyth-Edwards Notation</a>, which will give you a short ascii representation. e.g.:</p>

<pre>
rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1
</pre>

<p>Would be the opening board position.</p>

<p>Then to represent a particular move from a position you could use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICCF_numeric_notation" rel="nofollow">numeric move notation</a> (as used in correspondence chess), which give you a short (4-5 digits) representation of a move on the board.</p>

<p>As to represent the rules - I'd love to know myself.  Currently the rules for my chess engine are just written in Python and probably aren't as declarative as I'd like.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>I would agree with the comment left by ΤΖΩΤΖΙΟΥ, viz. just let the server do the validation and let the clients submit a potential move. If that's not the way you want to take the design, then just write the rules in Python as suggested by S. Lott and others.</p>

<p>It really shouldn't be that hard. You can break the rules down into three major categories:<br />
  - Rules that rely on the state of the board (castling, en passant, draws, check, checkmate, passing through check, is it even this player's turn, etc.)<br />
  - Rules that apply to all pieces (can't occupy the same square as another piece of your own colour, moving to a square w/ opponent's piece == capture, can't move off the board)<br />
  - Rules that apply to each individual piece. (pawns can't move backwards, castles can't move diagonally, etc)</p>

<p>Each rule can be implemented as a function, and then for each half-move, validity is determined by seeing if it passes all of the validations.</p>

<p>For each potential move submitted, you would just need to check the rules in the following order:</p>

<ol>
<li>is the proposed move potentially valid? (the right "shape" for the piece)</li>
<li>does it fit the restraints of the board? (is the piece blocked, would it move off the edge)</li>
<li>does the move violate state requirements? (am I in check after this move? do I move through check? is this en passant capture legal?)</li>
</ol>

<p>If all of those are ok, then the server should accept the move as legal…</p>
