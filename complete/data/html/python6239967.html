<h3>Question (ID-6239967):</h3><h2>Determining whether an value is a whole number in Python</h2><p>I would like to determine if a numeric value in Python is a whole number. For example, given: </p>

<pre><code>y = x / 3
</code></pre>

<p>I want to distinguish between values of <code>x</code> which are evenly divisible by 3 those which are not.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><pre><code>if x % 3 == 0:
    print 'x is divisible by 3'
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><code>x % 3 == 0</code> will be <code>True</code> if <code>x / 3</code> is an integer.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Integers have no decimals. If you meant "check if <strong>a number</strong> got decimals in Python", you can do:</p>

<pre><code>not float(your_number).is_integer()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>assuming you mean if a string containing digits also has a decimal point:</p>

<pre><code>Python 2.6.6 (r266:84292, Apr 20 2011, 11:58:30) 
[GCC 4.5.2] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; number='123.4'
&gt;&gt;&gt; '.' in number
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; number='123'
&gt;&gt;&gt; '.' in number
False
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>To test if it's integral you could mod 1:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 1.0/3 % 1
0.33333333333333331
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1/3 % 1
0
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>In Python 2, dividing an int by an int returns an int (unless python was invoked with the <code>-Qnew</code> option, or a <code>from __future__ import division</code> is at the beginning of the source; in that case <code>/</code> returns a float); a <code>//</code> specifies integer division.</p>

<p>In Python 3, dividing an int by an int returns a float if you use "/", or an int if you use "//".</p>

<p>If you want to know whether an int will divide into another int exactly, use "%" to look for a remainder.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>It is best to make your determination before doing the division, assuming that your x variable is an integer.</p>

<p>Trying to do equality tests or comparisons on floating point numbers is dangerous: <a href="http://www.lahey.com/float.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lahey.com/float.htm</a></p>

<p>The answer already provided using modulus before doing the division to see if one integer is divsible by the other integer is safe.  After you do a division and are dealing with possibly floating point values, then numbers are no longer exactly integers or not.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>This function uses the fact that every other whole number will have at least one number divisible by two with no remainder. Any non-zero fractional representation in either n or n+1 will cause both n%2 and (n+1)%2 to have a remainder. This has the benefit that whole numbers represented as float values will return True. </p>

<p>The function works correctly for positive
and negative numbers and zero as far as I can determine. As mentioned in the function, it fails for values very close to an integer.</p>

<pre><code>def isInteger(n):
"""Return True if argument is a whole number, False if argument has a fractional part.

Note that for values very close to an integer, this test breaks. During
superficial testing the closest value to zero that evaluated correctly
was 9.88131291682e-324. When dividing this number by 10, Python 2.7.1 evaluated
the result to zero"""

if n%2 == 0 or (n+1)%2 == 0:
    return True
return False
