<h3>Question (ID-3095071):</h3><h2>In python, what happens when you import inside of a function?</h2><p>I am wondering what the pros and cons of importing a python module and/or function inside of the a function.  Does it re-import every time the function is run? Does it import once at the beginning whether or not the function is run?</p>

<p>Anyways I would appreciate Pros and Cons of importing inside of a function, more specifically on efficiency in speed more than memory.</p>

<p>No; or rather, Python modules are essentially cached every time they are imported, so importing a second (or third, or fourth...) time doesn't actually force them to go through the whole import process again.</p>

<p>No, it is only imported if and when the function is executed.</p>

<p>As for the benefits: it depends, I guess. If you may only run a function very rarely and don't need the module imported anywhere else, it <em>may</em> be beneficial to only import it in that function. Or if there is a name clash or other reason you don't want the module or symbols from the module available <em>everywhere</em>, you may only want to import it in a specific function. (Of course, there's always <code>from my_module import my_function as f</code> for those cases.)</p>

<p>In general practice, it's probably not that beneficial. In fact, most Python style guides encourage programmers to place all imports at the beginning of the module file.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The very first time you <code>import goo</code> from anywhere (inside or outside a function), <code>goo.py</code> (or other importable form) is loaded and <code>sys.modules['goo']</code> is set to the module object thus built.  Any future import within the same run of the program (again, whether inside or outside a function) just look up <code>sys.modules['goo']</code> and bind it to barename <code>goo</code> in the appropriate scope.  The dict lookup and name binding are very fast operations.</p>

<p>Assuming the very first <code>import</code> gets totally amortized over the program's run anyway, having the "appropriate scope" be module-level means each use of <code>goo.this</code>, <code>goo.that</code>, etc, is two dict lookups -- one for <code>goo</code> and one for the attribute name.  Having it be "function level" pays one extra local-variable setting per run of the function (even faster than the dictionary lookup part!) but saves one dict lookup (exchanging it for a local-variable lookup, blazingly fast) for each <code>goo.this</code> (etc) access, basically halving the time such lookups take.</p>

<p>We're talking about a few nanoseconds one way or another, so it's hardly a worthwhile optimization.  The one potentially substantial advantage of having the <code>import</code> within a function is when that function may well not be needed at all in a given run of the program, e.g., that function deals with errors, anomalies, and rare situations in general; if that's the case, any run that does not need the functionality will not even perform the import (and that's a saving of microseconds, not just nanoseconds), only runs that do need the functionality will pay the (modest but measurable) price.</p>

<p>It's still an optimization that's only worthwhile in pretty extreme situations, and there are many others I would consider before trying to squeeze out microseconds in this way.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>It imports once when the function executes first time.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li>imports related to the function they're used in</li>
<li>easy to move functions around the package</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li>couldn't see what modules this module might depend on</li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>It imports once when the function is called for the first time.</p>

<p>I could imagine doing it this way if I had a function in an imported module that is used very seldomly and is the only one requiring the import. Looks rather far-fetched, though...</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Importing inside a function will effectively import the module once.. the first time the function is run.</p>

<p>It ought to import just as fast whether you import it at the top, or when the function is run. This isn't generally a good reason to import in a def. Pros? It won't be imported if the function isn't called.. This is actually a reasonable reason if your module only requires the user to have a certain module installed if they use specific functions of yours...</p>

<p>If that's not he reason you're doing this, it's almost certainly a yucky idea.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Might I suggest in general that instead of asking, "Will X improve my performance?" you use profiling to determine where your program is <strong>actually</strong> spending its time and then apply optimizations according to where you'll get the most benefit?</p>

<p>And then you can use profiling to assure that your optimizations have actually benefited you, too.</p>
