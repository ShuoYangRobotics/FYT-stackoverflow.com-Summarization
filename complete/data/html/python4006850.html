<h3>Question (ID-4006850):</h3><h2>how to iterate from a specific point in a sequence (Python)</h2><p><strong>[Edit]</strong></p>

<p>From the feedback/answers I have received, I gather there is some confusion regarding the original question. Consequently, I have reduced the problem to its most rudimentary form</p>

<p>Here are the relevant facts of the problem:</p>

<ol>
<li>I have a sorted sequence: <strong>S</strong></li>
<li>I have an item (denoted by <strong><em>i</em></strong>) that is GUARANTEED to be contained in <strong>S</strong></li>
<li>I want a <strong>find()</strong> algorithm that returns an iterator (<strong><em>iter</em></strong>) that points to <strong><em>i</em></strong></li>
<li>After obtaining the iterator, I want to be able to iterate FORWARD (BACKWARD?) over the elements in <strong><em>S</em></strong>, starting FROM (and including) <strong><em>i</em></strong></li>
</ol>

<p>For my fellow C++ programmers who can also program in Python, what I am asking for, is the equivalent of:</p>

<pre><code>const_iterator std::find (const key_type&amp; x ) const;
</code></pre>

<p>The iterator returned can then be used to iterate the sequence. I am just trying to find (pun unintended), if there is a similar inbuilt algorithm in Python, to save me having to reinvent the wheel. </p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>yes , you can do like this:</p>

<pre><code>import itertools
from datetime import datetime

data = {
      "2008-11-10 17:53:59":"data",
      "2005-11-10 17:53:59":"data",
}

list_ = data.keys()
new_list = [datetime.strptime(x, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S") for x in list_]

begin_date = datetime.strptime("2007-11-10 17:53:59", "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

for i in itertools.ifilter(lambda x: x &gt; begin_date, new_list):
    print i
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>If you know for a fact that the items in your sequence are sorted, you can just use a generator expression:</p>

<pre><code>(item for item in seq if item &gt;= 5)
</code></pre>

<p>This returns a generator; it doesn't actually traverse the list until you iterate over it, i.e.:</p>

<pre><code>for item in (item for item in seq if item &gt; 5)
    print item
</code></pre>

<p>will only traverse <code>seq</code> once.</p>

<p>Using a generator expression like this is pretty much identical to using <code>itertools.ifilter</code>, which produces a generator that iterates over the list returning only values that meet the filter criterion:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import itertools
&gt;&gt;&gt; seq = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
&gt;&gt;&gt; list(itertools.ifilter(lambda x: x&gt;=3, seq))
[3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure why (except for backwards compatibility) we need <code>itertools.ifilter</code> anymore now that we have generator expressions, but other methods in <code>itertools</code> are invaluable.  </p>

<p>If, for instance, you <em>don't</em> know that your sequence is sorted, and you still want to return everything in the sequence from a known item and beyond, you can't use a generator expression.  Instead, use <code>itertools.dropwhile</code>.  This produces a generator that iterates over the list skipping values until it finds one that meets the filter criterion:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; seq = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 6, 7]
&gt;&gt;&gt; list(itertools.dropwhile(lambda x: x != 3, seq))
[3, 5, 6, 7]
</code></pre>

<p>As far as searching backwards goes, this will only work if the sequence you're using is actually a sequence (like a list, i.e. something that <em>has</em> an end and <em>can</em> be navigated backwards)  and not just any iterable (e.g. a generator that returns the next prime number).  To do this, use the <code>reversed</code> function, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>(item for item in reversed(seq) if item &gt;= 5)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Given your relevant facts:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import bisect
&gt;&gt;&gt; def find_fwd_iter(S, i):
...     j = bisect.bisect_left(S, i)
...     for k in xrange(j, len(S)):
...         yield S[k]
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; def find_bkwd_iter(S, i):
...     j = bisect.bisect_left(S, i)
...     for k in xrange(j, -1, -1):
...         yield S[k]
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; L = [100, 150, 200, 300, 400]
&gt;&gt;&gt; list(find_fwd_iter(L, 200))
[200, 300, 400]
&gt;&gt;&gt; list(find_bkwd_iter(L, 200))
[200, 150, 100]
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>One simpler way (albeit slower) would be to use <code>filter</code> and filter for keys before/after that date. Filter has to process each element in the list as opposed to slicing not needing to.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You can do</p>

<pre><code>def on_or_after(date):
    from itertools import dropwhile
    sorted_items = sorted(date_dictionary.iteritems())
    def before_date(pair):
        return pair[0] &lt; date
    on_or_after_date = dropwhile(before_date, sorted_items)
</code></pre>

<p>which I think is about as efficient as it's going to get if you're just doing one such lookup on each sorted collection.  <code>on_or_after_date</code> will iterate (date, value) pairs.</p>

<p>Another option would be to build a dictionary as a separate index into the sorted list:</p>

<pre><code>sorted_items = sorted(date_dictionary.iteritems())
date_index = dict((key, i) for i, key in enumerate(sorted_items.keys()))
</code></pre>

<p>and then get the items on or after a date with</p>

<pre><code>def on_or_after(date):
    return sorted_items[date_index[date]:]
</code></pre>

<p>This second approach will be faster if you're going to be doing a lot of lookups on the same series of sorted dates (which it sounds like you are).</p>

<p>If you want really speedy slicing of the sorted dates, you might see some improvement by storing it in a tuple instead of a list.  I could be wrong about that though.</p>

<p><strong>note</strong> the above code is untested, let me know if it doesn't work and you can't sort out why.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>First off, this question isn't related to dicts.  You're operating on a sorted <code>list</code>.  You're using the <em>results</em> on a dict, but that's not relevant to the question.</p>

<p>You want the <code>bisect</code> module, which implements binary searching.  Starting from your code:</p>

<pre><code>import bisect
mydict = {
      "2001-01-01":"data1",
      "2005-01-02":"data2",
      "2002-01-01":"data3",
      "2004-01-02":"data4",
}

# ['2001-01-01', '2002-01-01', '2004-01-02', '2005-01-02']:
sorted_dates = sorted(mydict)

# Iterates over 2002-01-01, 2004-01-02 and 2005-01-02:
offset = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_dates, "2002-01-01")
for item in sorted_dates[offset:]:
    print item
</code></pre>
