<h3>Question (ID-1154373):</h3><h2>Python write to line flow</h2><p>Part of my script is taking values and putting them to a text file delimited by tabs. So I have this:</p>

<pre><code>for linesplit in fileList:
    for i in range (0, len(linesplit)):
        t.write (linesplit[i]+'\t')
</code></pre>

<p>I get as an output in the file what I expect in the first line but in the following lines they all start with a \t in them, like is:</p>

<pre><code>value1    value2    value3
    value1    value2    value3
    value1    value2    value3
</code></pre>

<p>Also, why don't I need to add a t.write('\n') after the second FOR loop to create the newlines? I would expect the code above to produce one long line of tab separated values but it doesn't. If I include the t.write('\n') then the tabs issue is resolved but I get double '\n'...</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>it doesn't produce what you want because original lines (<code>linesplit</code>) contain end of line character (<code>\n</code>) that you're not stripping. insert the following before your second for loop:</p>

<pre><code>linesplit = linesplit.strip('\n')
</code></pre>

<p>That should do the job.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I'm sorry... After I hit submit it dawned on me. My last value already has a \n in it which causes the newline.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Your last value must have a "\n" which causes both problems: The first problem because it outputs '\t' after the newline, the second problem should be obvious - the mystery newlines are coming from your last value.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>you linesplit variable could have newlines. just use strip() to remove it. </p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Your <code>"value3"</code> strings are really <code>"value3\n"</code>, which explains the magical newlines and the extraneous tabs on all but the first line.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>The inner loop isn't required. Perhaps you meant to use:</p>

<pre><code>t.write('\t'.join(linesplit))
</code></pre>
