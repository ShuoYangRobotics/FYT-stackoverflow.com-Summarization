<h3>Question (ID-2363116):</h3><h2>Teaching Python to a Law Student</h2><p>Im trying to teach python to a Law student (happens to be my fiancee).She has been insisting on me teaching her about it. One problem: She doesn't know anything about programming. </p>

<p>I was thinking on starting with <a href="http://diveintopython.org/" rel="nofollow">dive into python</a>, but i'm worried most not about the python part, but the "she does not know anything about programming" problem.</p>

<p>How can I keep her interested? I'm worried because she will have to learn if/else - oop - functions and stuff as she learns the python syntax, and she might get bored.</p>

<p>Maybe a project we can work together? Some simple django app?</p>

<p>Any ideas will be appreciated.</p>

<p>Screencasts are a great way to learn new stuff fast and not-so-boring. Try <a href="http://showmedo.com" rel="nofollow">http://showmedo.com</a> for example</p>

<p>It's written using Python and sounds like a good introduction to programming for beginners of all ages - I'm thinking about getting it for my nephew's birthday.</p>

<p>Might be worth a look?</p>

<p>Non-programmers are my target market.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The only way to learn is to automate some everyday tasks for her, for example fetching her online news or something, or something like a basic password manager. </p>

<p>The possibilities are endless ! :P</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Tom, my experience has not been positive about it. My wife "wanted" to learn python but never went beyond a few chapters of "Dive into Python". I vaguely infer that she had a few doubts on the way, and never got interested in solving them. I have little doubt that an adult seldom does something new unless he/she needs to do it. </p>

<p>I do not want to discourage you but I'd leave it up to her (my wife) to decide whether to learn programming or not -- I would not try to teach her if she does not ask for that. My wife is quite interested in photography instead.   </p>

<p>On the positive side, we might have new ways of learning programming invented only recently like <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/" rel="nofollow">Scratch</a>, which probably have a better chance of conversions. </p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>A more "fun" approach to try is to give examples of everyday things that your wife will understand. Say if you are teaching her about if/else control flow, then give examples like "if time is 8am, wake up to go to work, else continue sleeping". In pseudocode, </p>

<pre><code>if time == 8am:
   do wake up
else:
   do continue sleeping.
</code></pre>

<p>Other examples, learning about functions. So you can tell her, that functions let her do things over and over. eg</p>

<pre><code>def go_toilet():
    open door
    close door
    lift toilet seat
    do stuff
    flush
    wash hands
    exit door
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I have heard good things about the book <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/ltp2/learn-to-program-2nd-edition" rel="nofollow">Learn to Program</a> from the Pragmatic Programmers. It uses Ruby instead of Python, and is geared toward teaching basic programming concepts to complete beginners.</p>

<p>It seems to have examples and exercises geared toward stuff your average person can relate to.</p>
