<h3>Question (ID-466684):</h3><h2>How can I return system information in Python?</h2><p>Using Python, how can information such as CPU usage, memory usage (free, used, etc), process count, etc be returned in a generic manner so that the same code can be run on Linux, Windows, BSD, etc?</p>

<p>Alternatively, how could this information be returned on all the above systems with the code specific to that OS being run only if that OS is indeed the operating environment?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Regarding cross-platform: your best bet is probably to write platform-specific code, and then import it conditionally.  e.g.</p>

<pre><code>import sys
if sys.platform == 'win32':
  import win32_sysinfo as sysinfo
elif sys.platform == 'darwin':
  import mac_sysinfo as sysinfo
elif 'linux' in sys.platform:
  import linux_sysinfo as sysinfo
#etc

print 'Memory available:', sysinfo.memory_available()
</code></pre>

<p>For specific resources, as Anthony points out you can access <code>/proc</code> under linux.  For Windows, you could have a poke around at the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/scriptcenter/scripts/python/default.mspx?mfr=true" rel="nofollow">Microsoft Script Repository</a>.  I'm not sure where to get that kind of information on Macs, but I can think of a great website where you could ask :-)</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>In a Linux environment you could read from the /proc file system.</p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>It looks like you want to get a lot more information than the standard Python library offers. If I were you, I would download the source code for 'ps' or 'top', or the Gnome/KDE version of the same, or any number of system monitoring/graphing programs which are more likely to have all the necessary Unix cross platform bits, see what they do, and then make the necessary native calls with ctypes.</p>

<p>It's trivial to detect the platform. For example with ctypes you might try to load libc.so, if that throws an exception try to load 'msvcrt.dll' and so on. Not to mention simply checking the operating system's name with os.name. Then just delegate calls to your new cross-platform API to the appropriate platform-specific (sorry) implementation.</p>

<p>When you're done, don't forget to upload the resulting package to pypi.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I recommend the platform module:</p>

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>take a look to the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/os.html" rel="nofollow">os module</a>...</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Yes - the OS package is the way to go but it doesn't give you everything you are looking for.</p>

<p>There's an example <a href="http://www.wellho.net/resources/ex.php4?item=y115/get_os.py" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>There's the <a href="http://www.psychofx.com/psi/" rel="nofollow">PSI</a> (Python System Information) project with that aim, but they don't cover Windows yet.</p>

<p>You can probably use PSI and recpies <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/511491/" rel="nofollow">like this one</a> and create a basic library that meets your needs.</p>
