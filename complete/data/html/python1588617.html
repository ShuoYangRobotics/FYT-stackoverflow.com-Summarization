<h3>Question (ID-1588617):</h3><h2>php vs python. scalability</h2><p>Why is PHP considered more scalable than python?</p>

<p>I've heard may times that one of the reasons PHP is "better" than python is that PHP is more easily scalable, and that Yahoo proves that(assumig Yahoo still uses PHP).</p>

<p>Whats the difference between PHP and Python when it comes to scalability?</p>

<p>-- edit --</p>

<p>well, i have no evidence, the question arose after a discussion with a friend.</p>

<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Well, Google uses a lot of Python, so there goes that argument...</p>

<p>Scalability is a complex issue, and can never be reduced to saying that X is more scalable than Y. Scalable how? Memory? Speed? Storage? It's like saying that PHP is greener than Python, or the other way around. It's just utter nonsense.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><blockquote>
  <p>Languages, libraries and frameworks
  don't scale. Architectures do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you design a solid architecture. If you are able to make it evolve quickly. It will scale. </p>

<p>Yahoo! uses PHP, Google uses Python. But both use C/C++ for resource intensive processing, because you won't use an interpreted language for that anyway.</p>

<p>Now the real deal is, which one will let your team scale the most easily ? Since I worked with Python and PHP a lot, I tend to think that the first one leads to a much easier to debug / maintain code. And when your project will grow, your team will follow, so its an important point to take in consideration.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>What some folks like to say is this.</p>

<p>PHP is embedded within Apache, and uses relatively little memory.</p>

<p>Python is less often embedded within Apache, and uses more memory than PHP.  Python is sometimes run as a separate daemon process.  (It can also be embedded, so one could run head-to-head tests, FWIW.  It's not worth much trying to do head-to-head, more on that below.)</p>

<p>We don't use PHP, so I don't have numbers.  However, the daemonized Python (via mod_wsgi) runs our transactions fast enough that I can't easily put together a load test because my laptop can't pump enough transactions through the VPN and Firewall to measure anything other than VPN delays.</p>

<p>Further, as our usage grows, we simply add Python daemon instances through simple Apache changes to handle the workload.  If we eventually outgrow the VM, we'll simply split the Apache front-ends from the Python backends onto separate VM's.  We can't foresee a limit to this kind of growth -- more Apache, more Python daemons.</p>

<p>You can't easily compare PHP and Python because the approach to a web application is generally quite different.  PHP is programming language, template language and HTTP handler in one single bundle.  Python is just a language.  You have to add a template processor (there are many) and an HTTP handler (there are many) to have a comparable toolset.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>In my own mind, it's not the language that matters, as much as how that language is used, and how the applications, are well written to be more scalable.</p>

<p>And also important is how well it works with the databases, and file i/o, what caching methods are available...</p>

<p>At least that's my 2 cents.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Check out my article on scalability: <a href="http://www.tomhoad.com/blog/?p=23" rel="nofollow">http://www.tomhoad.com/blog/?p=23</a>. I would argue that the way you design your app or site, and the principles you employ when building it, are far more important than what language or framework you're using.</p>

<p>There's more to scalability than language or framework.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>A nice article by Jeff Atwood: <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001119.html" rel="nofollow">PHP Sucks, But It Doesn't Matter</a></p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Little old but compare performance between php (symfony) and python framework (django).
An element of reponse.</p>

<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>PHP is really no match to Python. I have been PHP developer for 3 years and switched to python because i feel Python is more like a hybrid language. Because of python flexibility features i can easily scale.</p>
