<h3>Question (ID-5214369):</h3><h2>Python vs Matlab</h2><p>I'm considering making the switch from Matlab to Python.  The application is quantitative trading and cost is not really an issue.  There are a few things I love about Matlab and am wondering how Python stacks up (could not find any answers in the reviews I've read).</p>

<p>1) Is there an IDE for Python that is as good as Matlab's (variable editor, debugger, profiler)?  I've read good things about Spyder, but does it have a profiler?</p>

<p>2) When you change a function on the path in Matlab, it is automatically reloaded.  Do you have to manually re-import libraries when you change them, or can this been done automatically?  This is a minor thing, but actually greatly improves my productivity.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>IDE: No. Python IDEs are nowhere near as good or mature as Matlab's, though I've heard good things about Wing IDE. Generally, I find IDEs to be total overkill for Python development, and find that I'm more productive with a well-setup text editor (vim in my case) and a separate visual debugger (WinPDB).</p>

<p>Changing functions: Modules must be reloaded after changes using the <code>reload()</code> built-in function.</p>

<pre><code>import foo
#now you've changed foo.py and want to reload it
foo = reload(foo)
</code></pre>

<p>I've switched over myself from Matlab to Python, because I find that Python deals much better with complexity, i.e., I find it easier to write, debug and maintain complex code in Python. One of the reasons for this is that Python is a general purpose language rather than a specialist matrix-manipulation language. Because of this, entities like strings, non-numerical arrays and (crucially) associative arrays (or maps or dictionaries) are first-class constructs in Python, as are classes. </p>

<p>With regards to capabilities, with numpy, scipy and matplotlib, you pretty much have the whole set of functionality that Matlab provides out of the box, and quite a lot of stuff that you would have to buy separate toolboxes for.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You might also want to check out some of the answers in the following thread, although they don't address your 2 major concerns:</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5063037/should-i-switch-to-python/5065585#5065585">Should i switch to Python?</a></p>

<p>I'm also a total convert from Matlab:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I have yet to use a full featured Python IDE, but have gotten on pretty well in IPython in combination with Matplotlib, Numpy, Scipy, etc. I actually use the Enthough Python Distribution that comes preloaded with most of the scientific/quantitative packages I need. I've also heard good things about Python(x,y) and Sage</p></li>
<li><p>Maybe other IDE's handle this but in IPython I use autoreload which works fairly well.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As others have mentioned, since the numerical/quantitative libraries came to Python instead of a numerical library hacking a language on top, you have an incredible amount of flexibility that you don't have with Matlab. Also the Python community, especially in the numerical/quantitative areas, is really quite fantastic. </p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>We use the <a href="http://wingware.com/" rel="nofollow">Wing IDE</a> for Python development. It is quite well featured, has integrated debugging support, and can be connected to the profiler of your choice.</p>

<p>Regarding (2), I know exactly what you mean since I miss that very same feature from Lisp, and so far as I know you need to actively reimport the libraries after changing them. This isn't a real hangup, though, since you can easily write (once) a small function that does that for every module you care about, and then put that function on a key macro so all you have to do is <em>eg</em> hit CTRL-T after changing code.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I've been getting on very well with the Spyder IDE in the Python(x,y) distribution. I'm a long term user of Matlab and have known of the existence of Python for 10 years or so but it's only since I installed Python(x,y) that I've started using Python regularly.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>almost everything is covered by others .. i hope you don't need any toolboxes like optimizarion toolbox , neural network etc.. [ I didn't find these for python  may be there are some .. i seriously doubt they might be better than Matlab ones..]</p>

<p>if u don't need symbolic manipulation capability and are using windows python(x,y) is the way to go[they don't have much activity on their linux port (older versions are available)]
(or need some minor symbolic manipulations use sympy , i think it comes with EPD and python(x,y) supersedes/integrates  EPD)</p>

<p>if you need symbolic capabilities sage is the way to go, IMHO sage stands up good with Matlab as well as Mathematica ..</p>

<p>i'm also trying to make a switch  ...(need for my engg projs)</p>

<p>i hope it helps ..</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Concerning the IDE question, have look at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/81584/321973">What IDE to use for Python?</a>, where the top answer is <a href="http://pydev.org/" rel="nofollow">PyDev</a> which uses Eclipse.</p>

<p>I also think <a href="http://www.sagemath.org/" rel="nofollow">Sage</a> might be worth looking at</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Also look at the Python/Jython IDE from the <a href="http://jwork.org/jhepwork/" rel="nofollow">jHepWork project</a></p>

<p>It has a code assist which is especially designed for Python/Jython and Java. This IDE  contains complete syntax highlighting for Python, bracket matching, indentation matching. Finally, the output graphics is a way better than in Matlab </p>
