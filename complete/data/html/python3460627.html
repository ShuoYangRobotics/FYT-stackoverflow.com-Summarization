<h3>Question (ID-3460627):</h3><h2>The Zen of Ruby</h2><p>I have written a Ruby gem named 'this'. Get it here <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/this" rel="nofollow">http://rubygems.org/gems/this</a>. Purpose of 'this' is to show quotes of 'The Zen of Ruby' whenever you "require 'this'". As I could not find any equivalent zen quotes for Ruby, currently I am using 'The Zen of Python' (PEP 20). Extremely sorry for using it :)</p>

<p>Can you guys suggest me good quotes that Ruby 'Zen' should have. I would update 'this' gem to have new quotes.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
