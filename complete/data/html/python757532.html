<h3>Question (ID-757532):</h3><h2>Shell: insert a blank/new line two lines above pattern</h2><p>I have a text file and it requires some formatting.<br />
I know that if you want to add a blank line above every line that matches your regexp, you can use:</p>

<pre><code>sed '/regexp/{x;p;x;}'
</code></pre>

<p>But I'd like to add a blank line, not one line above, but two lines above the line which matches my regexp.</p>

<p>The pattern I'll be matching is a postal code, in the address line.</p>

<p>Here is (part of) the format that the file has.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>dynamic line (belongs to previous business)<br />
  name of a new business<br />
  address of new business  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And an example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Languages Spoken: English<br />
  Arnold's Cove, Nfld (sub To Clarenville)<br />
  Nile Road, Arnolds Cove, NL, A0B1N0</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'd like to have the new line above the business name. Thus:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Languages Spoken: English</p>
  
  <p>Arnold's Cove, Nfld (sub To Clarenville)<br />
  Nile Road, Arnolds Cove, NL, A0B1N0</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Solutions in Python or Perl are good as well.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env perl
use constant LINES =&gt; 2;
my @buffer = ();
while (&lt;&gt;) {
    /pattern/ and unshift @buffer, "\n";
    push @buffer, $_;
    print splice @buffer, 0, -LINES;
}
continue {
    if (eof(ARGV)) {
        print @buffer;
        @buffer = ();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Something a bit like your original approach in sed:</p>

<pre><code>sed '/regexp/i\

$H
x'
</code></pre>

<p>The basic idea is to print everything delayed by one line (<strong>x</strong>change the hold and pattern spaces - printing is implicit). That needs to be done because until we check whether the next line matches the regexp we don't know whether to <strong>i</strong>nsert a newline or not. </p>

<p>(The $H there is just a trick to make the last line print. It appends the last line into the hold buffer so that the final implicit print command outputs it too.)</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Simple:</p>

<pre><code>sed '1{x;d};$H;/regexp/{x;s/^/\n/;b};x'
</code></pre>

<p>Describe it</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sed

# trick is juggling previous and current line in hold and pattern space

1 {         # at firs line
  x         # place first line to hold space
  d         # skip to end and avoid printing
}
$H          # append last line to hold space to force print
/regexp/ {  # regexp found (in current line - pattern space)
  x         # swap previous and current line between hold and pattern space
  s/^/\n/   # prepend line break before previous line
  b         # jump at end of script which cause print previous line
}
x           # if regexp does not match just swap previous and current line to print previous one
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Little bit simpler version.</p>

<pre><code>sed '$H;/regexp/{x;s/^/\n/;b};x;1d'
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><pre><code>perl -ne 'END{print @x} push@x,$_; if(@x&gt;2){splice @x,1,0,"\n" if /[[:alpha:]]\d[[:alpha:]]\s?\d[[:alpha:]]\d/;print splice @x,0,-2}'
</code></pre>

<p>If I cat your file into this, I get what you want... it's ugly, but you wanted shell (i.e., one-liner) :-)  If I were to do this in full perl, I'd be able to clean it up a lot to make it approach readable.  :-)</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Here's an approach that works for Python.</p>

<pre><code>import sys
def address_change( aFile ):
    address= []
    for line in aFile:
        if regex.match( line ):
            # end of the address
            print address[0]
            print 
            print address[1:]
            print line
            address= []
         else:
            address.append( line )
address_change( sys.stdin )
</code></pre>

<p>This allows you to reformat a complete address to your heart's content.  You can expand this to create define an <code>Address</code> class if your formatting is complex.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I tried</p>

<pre><code>sed '/regexp/a\\n'
</code></pre>

<p>but it inserted two newlines. If that does not bother you, take it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>echo -e "a\nb\nc" | sed '/^a$/a\n'<br />
  a  </p>
  
  <p>b<br />
  c  </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
Now that you state that you need to insert two lines above the matching regexp the suggested regex won't work.</p>

<p>I am not even sure if it would work at all with sed, as you need to remember past lines. Sounds like a job for a higher level language like python or perl :-)</p>
