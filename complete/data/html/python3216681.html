<h3>Question (ID-3216681):</h3><h2>Which of `if x:` or `if x != 0:` is preferred in Python?</h2><p>Assuming that <code>x</code> is an integer, the construct <code>if x:</code> is functionally the same as <code>if x != 0:</code> in Python. Some languages' style guides explicitly forbid against the former -- for example, ActionScript/Flex's style guide states that you should never implicitly cast an int to bool for this sort of thing.</p>

<p>Does Python have a preference? A link to a PEP or other authoritative source would be best.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The construct: <code>if x:</code> is generally used to check against boolean values.</p>

<p>For <code>int</code>s the use of the explicit <code>x != 0</code> is preferred - along the lines of <em>explicit is better than implicit</em> (<a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/" rel="nofollow">PEP 20 - Zen of Python</a>).</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>There's no hard and fast rule here.  Here are some examples where I would use each:</p>

<p>Suppose that I'm interfacing to some function that returns -1 on error and 0 on success.  Such functions are pretty common in C, and they crop up in Python frequently when using a library that wraps C functions.  In that case, I'd use <code>if x:</code>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if I'm about to divide by <code>x</code> and I want to make sure that <code>x</code> isn't <code>0</code>, then I'm going to be explicit and write <code>if x != 0</code>.</p>

<p>As a rough rule of thumb, if I treat <code>x</code> as a <code>bool</code> throughout a function, then I'm likely to use <code>if x:</code> -- even if I can prove that <code>x</code> will be an <code>int</code>.  If in the future I decide I want to pass a <code>bool</code> (or some other type!) to the function, I wouldn't need to modify it.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if I'm genuinely using <code>x</code> like an <code>int</code>, then I'm likely to spell out the <code>0</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Typically, I read: </p>

<p><code>if(x)</code> to be a question about existence. </p>

<p><code>if( x != 0)</code> to be a question about a number.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>It depends on what you want; if <code>x</code> is an integer, they're equivalent, but you should write the code that matches your exact intention.</p>

<pre><code>if x:
    # x is anything that evaluates to a True value
if x != 0:
    # x is anything that is not equal to 0
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Might I suggest that the amount of bickering over this question is enough to answer it?</p>

<p>Some argue that it "if x" should only be used for Z, others for Y, others for X.</p>

<p>If such a simple statement is able to create such a fuss, to me it is clear that the statement is not clear enough.  Write what you mean.</p>

<p>If you want to check that x is equal to 0, then write "if x == 0".  If you want to check if x exists, write "if x is not None".</p>

<p>Then there is no confusion, no arguing, no debate.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>If you want to test <em>x</em> in a boolean context:</p>

<pre><code>if x:
</code></pre>

<p>More explicit, for <em>x</em> validity (doesn't match empty containers):</p>

<pre><code>if x is not None:
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to test strictly in integer context:</p>

<pre><code>if x != 0:
</code></pre>

<p>This last one is actually implicitly comparing types.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Wouldn't <code>if x is not 0:</code> be the preferred method in Python, compared to <code>if x != 0:</code>?</p>

<p>Yes, the former is a bit longer to write, but I was under the impression that <code>is</code> and <code>is not</code> are preferred over <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code>. This makes Python easier to read as a natural language than as a programming language.</p>
