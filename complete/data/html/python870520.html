<h3>Question (ID-870520):</h3><h2>In Python, How Do You Filter a String Such That Only Characters in Your List Are Returned?</h2><p>Imagine a string, like 'Agh#$%#%2341-   -!zdrkfd' and I only wish to perform some operating on it such that only the lowercase letters are returned (as an example), which in this case would bring 'ghzdrkfd'.</p>

<p>How do you do this in Python?  The obvious way would be to create a list, of characters, 'a' through 'z', then iterate over the characters in my string and build a new string, character by character, of those in my list only.  This seems primitive.</p>

<p>I was wondering if regular expressions are appropriate.  Replacing unwanted characters seems problematic and I tend to prefer whitelisting over blacklisting.  The <code>.match</code> function does not seem appropriate.  I have looked over the appropriate page on the Python site, but have not found a method which seems to fit.</p>

<p>If regular expressions are not appropriate and the correct approach is looping, is there a simple function which "explodes" a string into a list?  Or am I just hitting another for loop there?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>If you are looking for efficiency. Using the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#str.translate" rel="nofollow">translate</a> function is the fastest you can get.</p>

<p>It can be used to quickly replace characters and/or delete them.</p>

<pre><code>import string
delete_table  = string.maketrans(
    string.ascii_lowercase, ' ' * len(string.ascii_lowercase)
)
table = string.maketrans('', '')

"Agh#$%#%2341- -!zdrkfd".translate(table, delete_table)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>In python 2.6:</strong> you don't need the second table anymore</p>

<pre><code>import string
delete_table  = string.maketrans(
    string.ascii_lowercase, ' ' * len(string.ascii_lowercase)
)
"Agh#$%#%2341- -!zdrkfd".translate(None, delete_table)
</code></pre>

<p>This is method is way faster than any other. Of course you need to store the delete_table somewhere and use it. But even if you don't store it and build it every time, it is still going to be faster than other suggested methods so far.</p>

<p>To confirm my claims here are the results:</p>

<pre><code>for i in xrange(10000):
    ''.join(c for c in s if c.islower())

real    0m0.189s
user    0m0.176s
sys 0m0.012s
</code></pre>

<p>While running the regular expression solution:</p>

<pre><code>for i in xrange(10000):
    re.sub(r'[^a-z]', '', s)

real    0m0.172s
user    0m0.164s
sys 0m0.004s
</code></pre>

<p><strong>[Upon request]</strong> If you pre-compile the regular expression:</p>

<pre><code>r = re.compile(r'[^a-z]')
for i in xrange(10000):
    r.sub('', s)

real    0m0.166s
user    0m0.144s
sys 0m0.008s
</code></pre>

<p>Running the translate method the same number of times took:</p>

<pre><code>real    0m0.075s
user    0m0.064s
sys 0m0.012s
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><pre><code>s = 'Agh#$%#%2341- -!zdrkfd'  
print ''.join(c for c in s if c.islower())
</code></pre>

<p>String objects are iterable; there is no need to "explode" the string into a list. You can put whatever condition you want in the list comprehension, and it will filter characters accordingly.</p>

<p>You could also implement this using a regex, but this will only hide the loop. The regular expressions library will still have to loop through the characters of the string in order to filter them.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s = 'Agh#$%#%2341- -!zdrkfd'
&gt;&gt;&gt; ''.join(i for i in s if  i in 'qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm')
'ghzdrkfd'
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Using a regular expression is easy enough, especially for this scenario:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import re
&gt;&gt;&gt; s = 'ASDjifjASFJ7364'
&gt;&gt;&gt; re.sub(r'[^a-z]+', '', s)
'jifj'
</code></pre>

<p>If you plan on doing this many times, it is best to compile the regular expression before hand:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import re
&gt;&gt;&gt; s = 'ASDjifjASFJ7364'
&gt;&gt;&gt; r = re.compile(r'[^a-z]+')
&gt;&gt;&gt; r.sub('', s)
'jifj'
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><pre><code>s = 'ASDjifjASFJ7364'
s_lowercase = ''.join(filter(lambda c: c.islower(), s))
print s_lowercase #print 'jifj'
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I'd use a regex. For lowercase match  [a-z].</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><pre><code>import string
print "".join([c for c in "Agh#$%#%2341- -!zdrkfd" if c in string.lowercase])
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Here's one solution if you are specifically interested in working on strings:</p>

<pre><code> s = 'Agh#$%#%2341- -!zdrkfd'
 lowercase_chars = [chr(i) for i in xrange(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1)]
 whitelist = set(lowercase_chars)
 filtered_list = [c for c in s if c in whitelist]
</code></pre>

<p>The whitelist is actually a set (not a list) for efficiency.</p>

<p>If you need a string, use join():</p>

<pre><code>filtered_str = ''.join(filtered_list)
</code></pre>

<p>filter() is a more generic solution. From the documentation (<a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>filter(function, iterable)</p>
  
  <p>Construct a list from those elements of iterable for which function returns true. iterable may be either a sequence, a container which supports iteration, or an iterator. If iterable is a string or a tuple, the result also has that type; otherwise it is always a list. If function is None, the identity function is assumed, that is, all elements of iterable that are false are removed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This would be one way of using filter():</p>

<pre><code>filtered_list = filter(lambda c: c.islower(), s)
</code></pre>
