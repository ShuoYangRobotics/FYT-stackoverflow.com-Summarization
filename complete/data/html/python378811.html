<h3>Question (ID-378811):</h3><h2>Getting python to work, Internal Server Error</h2><p>I'm trying to get Python scripts, called from a web browser, to work. I keep getting the error: </p>

<pre><code>500 Internal Server Error
</code></pre>

<p>When I check my error logs I see the message </p>

<pre><code>Premature end of script headers
</code></pre>

<p>The only documentation of this error online says that it can be the result of having improper line return characters in your script, but I wrote my test script right from the shell with pico. Also, when I run the file from the command line it executes just fine. 
"
So far the only change I have made to apache is to add the .py to the "AddHandler cgi-script" line.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Thanks for the quick responses. Here is the latest version of the test code. I added a couple new lines before the output as suggested but still get the same error:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/local/bin/python
print "Content-type: text/html\n"
print "\n\n"
print "&lt;HTML&gt;"
print "&lt;HEAD&gt;"
print "&lt;TITLE&gt;Test&lt;/TITLE&gt;"
print "&lt;/HEAD&gt;"
print "&lt;BODY&gt;"
print "&lt;H2&gt;Hi there.&lt;/h2&gt;"
print "&lt;/BODY&gt;"
print "&lt;/HTML&gt;"
</code></pre>

<p>Some other details: I am running Apache 1.3 and don't have mod_python. I set apache to recognize .py as mentioned above. I am running the script from the main public_html folder. </p>

<hr>

<p>An update. It doesn't seem to matter what I put in the shebang line. I tried all of the suggestions and even if I leave it blank the same error is showing up in the errors log and I'm getting a 500 error. </p>

<p>I'm running Apache/1.3.41 on linux (red hat 3.4) with WHM/Cpanel installed.  </p>

<ol>
<li>Make sure you are outputting the <code>Content-Type: text/html</code> header</li>
<li>Make sure you are adding two newlines ("\n") after the headers before you output "Hello, world" or whatever. </li>
</ol>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>This is the exact behavior you would get if your Python script does not have the executable permission set.</p>

<p>Try:</p>

<pre><code>chmod a+x foo.py
</code></pre>

<p>(where foo.py is your script name).</p>

<p>See the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/howto/cgi.html#filepermissions" rel="nofollow">Apache tutorial</a> for more information.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>do you have something like this at the top before you print anything else?</p>

<pre><code>print "Content-type: text/html\n"
</code></pre>

<p>If you already have this, then post your code.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You may also get a better error message by adding this line at the top of your Python script:</p>

<p><code>import cgitb; cgitb.enable()</code></p>

<p>Also, the header should be capitalized <code>Content-Type</code>, not <code>Content-type</code>, although I doubt that that is breaking anything.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>OK last guess:</p>

<p>Trying changing that shebang line to:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
</code></pre>

<p>or </p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/local/env python
</code></pre>

<p>It would also be helpful to know your platform / hosting provider.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I had a similiar problem running my own local server, but got it solved following this guide step-by-step: <a href="http://docs.python.org/howto/webservers.html" rel="nofollow">HOWTO Use Python in the web</a></p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Sounds to me like you're using a script written in Windows on a Unix machine, without first converting the line-endings from 0d0a to 0a.  It should be easy to convert it.  One way is with your ftp program;  transfer the file in ASCII mode.  The way I use with Metapad is to use File->FileFormat before saving.</p>
