<h3>Question (ID-836387):</h3><h2>How can I tell if a python variable is a string or a list?</h2><p>I have a routine that takes a list of strings as a parameter, but I'd like to support passing in a single string and converting it to a list of one string. For example:</p>

<pre><code>def func( files ):
    for f in files:
        doSomethingWithFile( f )

func( ['file1','file2','file3'] )

func( 'file1' ) # should be treated like ['file1']
</code></pre>

<p>How can my function tell whether a string or a list has been passed in? I know there is a <code>type</code> function, but is there a "more pythonic" way?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Personally, I don't really like this sort of behavior -- it interferes with duck typing. One could argue that it doesn't obey the "Explicit is better than implicit" mantra. Why not use the varargs syntax:</p>

<pre><code>def func( *files ):
    for f in files:
        doSomethingWithFile( f )

func( 'file1', 'file2', 'file3' )
func( 'file1' )
func( *listOfFiles )
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Well, there's nothing unpythonic about checking type.  Having said that, if you're willing to put a small burden on the caller:</p>

<pre><code>def func( *files ):
    for f in files:
         doSomethingWithFile( f )

func( *['file1','file2','file3'] ) #Is treated like func('file1','file2','file3')
func( 'file1' )
</code></pre>

<p>I'd argue this is more pythonic in that "explicit is better than implicit".  Here there is at least a recognition on the part of the caller when the input is already in list form.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><pre><code>isinstance(your_var, basestring)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I would say the most Python'y way is to make the user always pass a list, even if there is only one item in it. It makes it really obvious <code>func()</code> can take a list of files</p>

<pre><code>def func(files):
    for cur_file in files:
        blah(cur_file)

func(['file1'])
</code></pre>

<p>As Dave suggested, you could use the <code>func(*files)</code> syntax, but I never liked this feature, and it seems more explicit ("explicit is better than implicit") to simply require a list. It's also turning your special-case (calling <code>func</code> with a single file) into the default case, because now you have to use extra syntax to call <code>func</code> with a list..</p>

<p>If you do want to make a special-case for an argument being a string, use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#isinstance" rel="nofollow"><code>isinstance()</code> builtin</a>, and compare to <code>basestring</code> (which both <code>str()</code> and <code>unicode()</code> are derived from) for example:</p>

<pre><code>def func(files):
    if isinstance(files, basestring):
        doSomethingWithASingleFile(files)
    else:
        for f in files:
            doSomethingWithFile(f)
</code></pre>

<p>Really, I suggest simply requiring a list, even with only one file (after all, it only requires two extra characters!)</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>if hasattr(f, 'lower'):
    print "I'm string like"</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><pre><code>def func(files):
    for f in files if not isinstance(files, basestring) else [files]:
        doSomethingWithFile(f)

func(['file1', 'file2', 'file3'])

func('file1')
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Varargs was confusing for me, so I tested it out in Python to clear it up for myself.</p>

<p>First of all the PEP for varargs is <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3102/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>Here is sample program, based on the two answers from Dave and David Berger, followed by the output, just for clarification.</p>

<pre><code>def func( *files ):
    print files
    for f in files:
        print( f )

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func( *['file1','file2','file3'] ) #Is treated like func('file1','file2','file3')
    func( 'onestring' )
    func( 'thing1','thing2','thing3' )
    func( ['stuff1','stuff2','stuff3'] )
</code></pre>

<p>And the resulting output;</p>

<pre><code>('file1', 'file2', 'file3')
file1
file2
file3
('onestring',)
onestring
('thing1', 'thing2', 'thing3')
thing1
thing2
thing3
(['stuff1', 'stuff2', 'stuff3'],)
['stuff1', 'stuff2', 'stuff3']
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this is helpful to somebody else.</p>
