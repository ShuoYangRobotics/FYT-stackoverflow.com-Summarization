<h3>Question (ID-315363):</h3><h2>Spambots are cluttering my log file [Django]</h2><p>I have a nice and lovely Django site up and running, but have noticed that my <code>error.log</code> file was getting huge, over 150 MB after a couple of months of being live. Turns out a bunch of spambots are looking for well known URL vulnerabilities (or something) and hitting a bunch of sub-directories like <code>http://mysite.com/ie</code> or <code>http://mysite.com/~admin.php</code> etc. </p>

<p>Since Django uses URL rewriting, it is looking for templates to fit these requests, which raises a <code>TemplateDoesNotExist</code> exception, and then a 500 message (Django does this, not me). I have debug turned off, so they only get the generic 500 message, but it's filling up my logs very quickly.</p>

<p>Is there a way to turn this behavior off? Or perhaps just block the IP's doing this?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Um, perhaps, use <a href="http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/logrotate8.html" rel="nofollow">logrotate</a> to rotate and compress the logs periodically, if it isn't being done already.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>"Is there a way to turn this behavior off?" - the 500 is absolutely mandatory.  The log entry is also mandatory.  </p>

<p>"Or perhaps just block the IP's doing this?" - don't we wish.</p>

<p>Everyone has this problem.  Just about everyone uses Apache <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/logs.html#rotation" rel="nofollow">log rotation</a>.  Everyone else either uses an OS rotation or rolls their own.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If you can find a pattern in UserAgent string, you may use <code>DISALLOWED_USER_AGENT</code> setting. Mine is:</p>

<pre><code>DISALLOWED_USER_AGENTS = (
    re.compile(r'Java'),
    re.compile(r'gigamega'),
    re.compile(r'litefinder'),
)
</code></pre>

<p>See the description in <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#disallowed-user-agents" rel="nofollow">Django docs</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Django should be throwing a 404, not a 500, if the URL doesn't match any entries in your URLConf.</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/http/urls/#handler404" rel="nofollow">http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/http/urls/#handler404</a></p>

<p>You need to provide a 404 template:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you don't define your own 404 view -- and simply use the default, which is recommended -- you still have one obligation: To create a 404.html template in the root of your template directory. The default 404 view will use that template for all 404 errors.</p>
</blockquote>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>A programming solution would be to :</p>

<ul>
<li>open the log file</li>
<li>read the lines in a buffer</li>
<li>replace the lines that match the errors the bots caused</li>
<li>seek to the beginning of the file</li>
<li>write the new buffer</li>
<li>truncate the file to current pointer position</li>
<li>close</li>
</ul>

<p>Voila ! It's done !</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>How about setting up a catch-all pattern as the last item in your urls file and directing it to a generic "no such page" or even your homepage? In other words, turn 500's into requests for your homepage.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Why not fix those "bugs"? If a url pattern is not matched, then a proper error message should be shown. By adding those templates you will <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000819.html" rel="nofollow">help the user</a> and yourself :-)</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><ol>
<li><p>Yes, it should be a 404, not a 500. 500 indicates something is trying to deal with the URL and is failing in the process. You need to find and fix that.</p></li>
<li><p>We have a similar problem. Since we are running Apache/mod_python, I chose to deal with it in .htaccess with mod_rewrite rules. I periodically look at the logs and add a few patterns to my "go to hell" list. These all rewrite to deliver a 1x1 pixel gif file. There is no tsunami of 404s to clutter up my log analysis and it puts minimal load on Django and Apache.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You can't make these a**holes go away, so all you can do is minimize their impact on your system and get on with your life.</p>
