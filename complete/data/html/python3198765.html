<h3>Question (ID-3198765):</h3><h2>How to write Russian characters in file?</h2><p>In console when I'm trying output Russian characters It gives me ???????????????</p>

<p>Who know why?</p>

<p>I tried write to file - in this case the same situation.</p>

<p>for example</p>

<pre><code>f=open('tets.txt','w')
f.write('some russian text')
f.close
</code></pre>

<p>inside file is - ?????????????????????????/</p>

<p>or </p>

<pre><code>p="some russian text"
print p
?????????????
</code></pre>

<p>In additional Notepad don't allow me to save file with Russian letters. I give this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This file contains characters in
  Unicode format which will be lost if
  you save this file as an ANSI encoded
  text file. To keep the Unicode
  information, click Cancel below and
  then select one of the Unicode options
  from the Encoding drop down list.
  Continue?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How to adjust my system, so I will don't have this problems.</p>

<p><strong>Thanks for all! I solved this problem!</strong></p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Here is a worked-out example, please read the comments:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python2
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
# The above encoding declaration is required and the file must be saved as UTF-8

from __future__ import with_statement   # Not required in Python 2.6 any more

import codecs

p = u"абвгдежзийкл"  # note the 'u' prefix

print p   # probably won't work on Windows due to a complex issue

with codecs.open("tets.txt", "w", "utf-16") as stream:   # or utf-8
    stream.write(p + u"\n")

# Now you should have a file called "tets.txt" that can be opened with Notepad or any other editor
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Try <code>p=u"some russian text"</code></p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>What console are you using?  Chances are, your console doesn't support that language.  Make sure that your console supports Unicode (and that your app is sending Unicode strings).</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>To address the update to your question regarding problems with Windows' Notepad:  Click File->Save As, and then choose "Unicode" from the "Encoding" drop-down list.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Try opening the file using codecs, you need to </p>

<pre><code>import codecs
</code></pre>

<p>and then </p>

<pre><code>writefile = codecs.open('write.txt', 'w', 'utf-8')
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Are you typing in console too or only seing the results in console? This looks a pep-0263 problem as petraszd said.</p>

<pre><code>print p.decode('your-system-encoding')
</code></pre>

<p>should work in console (I don't know what is the encoding system you use for Russian)</p>

<p>If you are using a .py file, you need to place <code># -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-</code> (replacing utf-8 with Rusian encoding) on the top of the file and I think there is no need for the <code>.decode</code> in <code>print</code> if your OS is configured with the right encoding. (at least I don't need it but I don't know how it works with Russian)</p>
