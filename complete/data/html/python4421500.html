<h3>Question (ID-4421500):</h3><h2>Reducing complexity of following code</h2><p>What I wanted to do was to search in a list and remove a value .</p>

<p>So I wrote the following code</p>

<pre><code>for x in range(10):
   if x in list1:
      list1.remove(x)
</code></pre>

<p>Does this function of order ~ (n^2) since first it looks for the value and then it deletes and pushes the rest of the values backwards ??</p>

<p>Also is there a way to turn this in order n by using try/except</p>

<pre><code>try:
  for x in range(10):
    list1.remove(x)
except ValueError:
  # make it go back to next iteration 
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Use:</p>

<pre><code>L = [x for x in L if x not in removal_list]
</code></pre>

<p>removal_list can be any container, but if you use a set() or a frozenset() you will achieve O(n) (with n = len(L)).</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>This sounds like a job for <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#filter" rel="nofollow"><code>filter()</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; filter(lambda x: not x in (4, 5, 7), xrange(10))
[0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9]
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: one more example where I construct a list using <a href="http://docs.python.org/howto/functional.html" rel="nofollow"><em>list comprehension</em></a>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; filter(lambda x: not x[0] in (4, 5, 7), [[a] for a in xrange(10)])
[[0], [1], [2], [3], [6], [8], [9]]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Slice replacement:</p>

<pre><code>a[:] = ( l for l in a if l not in set(list_of_removable))
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Pythons not my area, but some things spring to mind. First, how big is the list, because you are going to iterate over it a number of times. If it's large it might be a better idea to flip things around so you only iterate over it once. </p>

<p>Second, if Python is like Java, then there is a rule for good code - Do not use exceptions for process flow. This rules out your second suggestion. It's also likely that it will perform badly.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Like Giovanni Bajo suggests, list comprehension is cool, but assuming you'll use the result only once, generators are even better:</p>

<pre><code>l = [1,23,2,24,3,26,1]
(x for x in l if x not in xrange(10))
</code></pre>

<p><code>xrange()</code> is a generator as well and is faster than <code>range()</code>
If you want to use the result more than once I'd go for:</p>

<pre><code>[x for x in l if x not in xrange(10)]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>To answer the original question: There is no getting around the fact that you will have to compare each element of the list-to-remove-elements-from to each element of the list-containing-removable-elements. So in that sense, every version of this code is O(N^2) (assuming we can have arbitrarily many elements in each list). You can hide the loops by using a variety of constructs (and in many cases it will be faster, because the looping can be done "internally" in the C code of the interpreter rather than by interpreting more bytecode), but the loops are still there (and remember that constant factors are ignored by big-O analysis).</p>
