<h3>Question (ID-434597):</h3><h2>Open document with default application in Python</h2><p>I need to be able to open a document using it's default application in Windows and Mac OS. Basically, I want to do the same thing that happens when you double click on the document icon in Explorer or Finder. What is the best way to do this in Python?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-10):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Use the subprocess module available on Python 2.4+, not os.system, so you don't have to deal with shell escaping.</p>

<pre><code>import subprocess, os
if os.name = 'mac':
    subprocess.call(('open', filepath))
elif os.name = 'nt':
    subprocess.call(('start', filepath), shell=True)
elif os.name = 'posix':
    subprocess.call(('xdg-open', filepath))
</code></pre>

<p>The double parentheses are because subprocess.call wants a sequence as its first argument, so we're using a tuple here. On Linux systems with Gnome there is also a "gnome-open" command that does the same thing.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>In Mac OS, you can use the "open" command.  There is a Windows API call that does something similar, but I don't remember it offhand.</p>

<h3>Update</h3>

<p>Okay, the "start" command will do it, so this should work.</p>

<p>Mac OS/X:</p>

<pre><code>os.system("open "+filename);
</code></pre>

<p>Windows:</p>

<pre><code>os.system("start "+filename);
</code></pre>

<h3>Later Update</h3>

<p>Okay, clearly this silly-ass controversy continues, so let's just look at doing this with subprocess.</p>

<p><code>open</code> and <code>start</code> are command interpreter things for Mac OS/X and Windows repsectively.  Now, let's say we use subprocess.  Canonically, you'd use:</p>

<pre><code>try:
    retcode = subprocess.call("open " + filename, shell=True)
    if retcode &lt; 0:
        print &gt;&gt;sys.stderr, "Child was terminated by signal", -retcode
    else:
        print &gt;&gt;sys.stderr, "Child returned", retcode
except OSError, e:
    print &gt;&gt;sys.stderr, "Execution failed:", e
</code></pre>

<p>Now, what are the advantages of this?  In theory, this is more secure -- but in fact we're needing to execute a command line one way or the other; in either environment, we need the environment and services to interpet, get paths, and so forth.  In neither case are we executing arbitrary text, so it doesn't have an inherent "but you can type <code>'filename ; rm -rf /'</code>" problem, and IF the file name can be corrupted, using <code>subprocess.call</code> gives us no protection.</p>

<p>It doesn't actually give us any more error detection, we're still depending on the <code>retcode</code> in either case.  We don't need to wait for the child process, since we're by problem statement starting a separate process.</p>

<p>"But <code>subprocess</code> is preferred."  However, <code>os.system()</code> is not deprecated, and it's the simplest tool for this particular job.</p>

<p>Conclusion: using <code>os.system()</code> is the simplest, most straightforward way to do this, and is therefore a correct answer.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Just for completeness (it wasn't in the question), <a href="http://portland.freedesktop.org/xdg-utils-1.0/xdg-open.html" rel="nofollow">xdg-open</a> will do the same on Linux.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><pre><code>import os
import subprocess

def click_on_file(filename):
    try:
        os.startfile(filename):
    except AttributeError:
        subprocess.call(['open', filename])
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I prefer:</p>

<pre><code>os.startfile(path, 'open')
</code></pre>

<p>(<a href="http://docs.python.org/library/os.html#os.startfile" rel="nofollow">python docs</a>) 'open' does not have to be added (it is the default).  The docs specifically mention that this is like double-clicking on a file's icon in Windows Explorer.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Windows only</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Start does not support long path names and white spaces. You have to convert it to 8.3 compatible paths.</p>

<pre><code>import subprocess
import win32api

filename = "C:\\Documents and Settings\\user\\Desktop\file.avi"
filename_short = win32api.GetShortPathName(filename)

subprocess.Popen('start ' + filename_short, shell=True )
</code></pre>

<p>The file has to exist in order to work with the API call.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>on mac os you can call 'open'</p>

<pre><code>import os
os.popen("open myfile.txt")
</code></pre>

<p>this would open the file with TextEdit, or whatever app is set as default for this filetype</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>If you want to go the <code>sybprocess.call()</code> way, it should look like this on Windows:</p>

<pre><code>import subprocess
subprocess.call(('cmd', '/C', 'start', '', FILE_NAME))
</code></pre>

<p>You can't just use:</p>

<pre><code>supbrocess.call(('start', FILE_NAME))
</code></pre>

<p>because <code>start</code> <a href="http://frank.neatstep.com/node/84" rel="nofollow">is not an executable</a> but a command of the <code>cmd.exe</code> program. This works:</p>

<pre><code>subprocess.call(('cmd', '/C', 'start', FILE_NAME))
</code></pre>

<p>but only if there are no spaces in the FILE_NAME.</p>

<p>While <code>subprocess.call</code> method enquotes the parameters properly, the <code>start</code> command has a rather strange syntax, where:</p>

<pre><code>start notes.txt
</code></pre>

<p>does something else than:</p>

<pre><code>start "notes.txt"
</code></pre>

<p>The first quoted string should set the title of the window. To make it work with spaces, we have to do:</p>

<pre><code>start "" "my notes.txt"
</code></pre>

<p>which is what the code on top does.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>I am pretty late to the lot, but here is a solution using the windows api. This always opens the associated application.</p>

<pre><code>import ctypes

shell32 = ctypes.windll.shell32
file = 'somedocument.doc'

shell32.ShellExecuteA(0,"open",file,0,0,5)
</code></pre>

<p>A lot of magic constants. The first zero is the hwnd of the current program. Can be zero. The other two zeros are optional parameters (parameters and directory). 5 == SW_SHOW, it specifies how to execute the app.

<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>If you want to specify the app to open the file with on Mac OS X, use this:
<code>os.system("open -a [app name] [file name]")</code></p>
