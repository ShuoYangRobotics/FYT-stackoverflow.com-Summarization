<h3>Question (ID-8644741):</h3><h2>Novice Python/Regex: pull strings between <a> tags using regex</h2><p>Need to pull strings between href attribute tags in Python using the re module.</p>

<p>I've tried numerous patterns such as:</p>

<pre><code>patFinderLink = re.compile('\&gt;"(CVE.*)"\&lt;\/a&gt;')
</code></pre>

<p>Example: I need to pull what is between the tags (in this case "<strong>CVE-2010-3718</strong>") from:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3718.html"&gt;CVE-2010-3718&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>What am I doing wrong here? Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.</p>

<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Do you need to use regex? I don't think you do, you can't parse SGML with regular expressions because SGML itself is not regular, see this famous stackoverflow answer for the reasoning: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454/88123">http://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454/88123</a></p>

<p>Anyhow. You should use the <code>lxml</code> Python module and its xpath implementation. <code>xpath</code> supports selecting with text that starts with.</p>

<p>XPath in this case would be <code>//h1/text()</code>.</p>

<p>Or, use the <code>BeautifulSoup</code> Python module.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Don't try to use regular expressions to parse HTML or XML. Use a parser such as <a href="http://lxml.de" rel="nofollow"><code>lxml</code></a>.</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>import lxml.html as lh

tree = lh.fromstring(html)

print tree.xpath("//pre/a[starts-with(., 'CVE')]/text()")
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Result:</strong></p>

<pre>
['CVE-2010-3718']
</pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Use</p>

<pre><code>re.compile('"&gt;(CVE.*?)&lt;/a&gt;') 

# instead of your re.compile('\&gt;"(CVE.*)"\&lt;\/a&gt;')
</code></pre>

<p>Note that characters &lt; > / don't need to be escaped in a regex pattern</p>

<p>And note that the <code>?</code> character after <code>.*</code> stops the greedy behavior of the quantifier <code>*</code> in order that the match stops when the first <code>&lt;/a&gt;</code> is encoutered. See the docs on this point, it is fundamental</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>Sometimes there are problems when using <code>re</code> to analyze a XML|GML text<br>
Once, I was told that one possible problem is that a tag can be written on several lines,  for example:</p>

<pre><code>ss = '''
&lt;pre&gt;
    &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3718.html"&gt;CVE-20
    10-371
    8&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;'''
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, there won't be any match because the dot used as symbol in a regex's pattern doesnt symbolize the newline '\n'. So the portion <code>.*?</code> of the pattern won't allow to run from line to line.</p>

<p>To correct this problem, use the <code>re.DOTALL</code> specification that gives to the dot symbol the power to represent any and all characters.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>Note that the common conviction is that the <strong>re</strong> tool must not be used to parse a SGML or XML text. But few people are able to explain thoroughly why. And I am one of these people who don't know precisely why.</p>

<p>But personally, I think that regular expression can be used to analyze texts indeed. I write 'ANALYZE' not 'PARSE'.</p>

<p>As far as I understood, parsing is the process of analyzing a text AND building a tree representation of it based on the tags.<br>
While I define analyzing a text as ... analyzing it without the aim to obtain a tree representation.<br>
When a tree representation isn't necessary to extract data from a text, use regular expressions, and don't listen guys that have religious considerations on the subject like in the funny but deceiving (in my opinion) post whose link has been given</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>If you still want to use regexps for HTML parsing (while it's not recommended as was alredy mentioned - but I don't know why) try this:</p>

<pre><code>a = re.compile('&lt;a href=".*"&gt;(.*)&lt;/a&gt;')
result = a.match(string).group(0)
</code></pre>

<p>the result will contain CVE-2010-3718</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>As others have already suggested, regular expressions are often not a good tool for HTML parsing.</p>

<p>But if you want to use regexp, this is an example of how i would extract all tuples of both URLs and content between the <code>&lt;a&gt; &lt;/a&gt;</code> tags:</p>

<pre><code>import re

#example html string with various hits
html_string = """
    &lt;pre&gt;
    &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3718.html"&gt;CVE-2010-3718&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3710.html"&gt;CVE-2010-3710&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3700.html"&gt;CVE-2010-3700&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/pre&gt;
"""

#regular expression:
pattern = re.compile('&lt;a href=([^&gt;]*)&gt;([^&lt;]*)&lt;/a&gt;')

#find all matches in our html string:
tuples = pattern.findall(html_string)

for tuple in tuples:
    print "%s â€”&gt; %s" % (tuple[1], tuple[0])
</code></pre>

<p>As others mentioned, lxml would be a more suitable tool.</p>

<p>If you are going to do it this way, i recommend you to follow the @Acorn reply.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I am surprised no one suggested to use BeautifulSoup:</p>

<p>here is how I would do it :</p>

<pre><code>from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup
import re

hello = """
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3718.html"&gt;CVE-2010-3718&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3710.html"&gt;CVE-2010-3718&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3700.html"&gt;CVE-2010-3718&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
"""

target = re.compile("CVE-\d+-\d+.html")
commentSoup = BeautifulSoup(hello)
atags = commentSoup.findAll(href=target)
for a in atags:
    match = re.findall(target, a['href'])[0]
    print match
</code></pre>

<p>Result:</p>

<pre><code>CVE-2010-3718.html
CVE-2010-3710.html
CVE-2010-3700.html
</code></pre>
