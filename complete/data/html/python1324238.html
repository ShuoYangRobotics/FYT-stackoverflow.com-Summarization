<h3>Question (ID-1324238):</h3><h2>What is the fastest template system for Python?</h2><p>Jinja2 and Mako are both apparently pretty fast.</p>

<p>How do these compare to (the less featured but probably good enough for what I'm doing) string.Template ?</p>

<p>The benchmark is based on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/spitfire/source/browse/trunk/tests/perf/bigtable.py" rel="nofollow">code from Spitfire performance tests</a> with some added template engines and added iterations to increase accuracy. The list and generator concat at the end are hand coded Python to get a feel for the upper limit of performance achievable by compiling to Python bytecode. The optimized versions use string interpolation in the inner loop.</p>

<p>But before you run out to switch your template engine, make sure it matters. You'll need to be doing some pretty heavy caching and really optimized code before the differences between the compiling template engines starts to matter. For most applications good abstraction facilities, compatibility with design tools, familiarity and other things matter much much more.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You probably don't care how fast the templating system is. Among the popular ones, they all have perfectly acceptable performance characteristics. Please make decisions like this based on more important things, like ease of programming.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If you can throw caching in the mix (like memcached) then choose based on features and ease of use rather than optimization.</p>

<p>I use Mako because I like the syntax and features. Fortunately it is one of the fastest as well.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>From the <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/2/documentation/faq" rel="nofollow">jinja2 docs</a>, it seems that string.Template is the fastest if that's all you need.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Without a doubt you should try to
  remove as much logic from templates as
  possible. But templates without any
  logic mean that you have to do all the
  processing in the code which is boring
  and stupid. A template engine that
  does that is shipped with Python and
  called string.Template. Comes without
  loops and if conditions and is by far
  the fastest template engine you can
  get for Python.</p>
</blockquote>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>In general you will have to do profiling to answer that question, as it depends on how you use the templates and what for.</p>

<p>string.Template is the fastest, but so primitive it can hardly be called a template in the same breath as the other templating systems, as it only does string replacements, and has no conditions or loops, making it pretty useless in practice.</p>

<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>According to the benchmarks offered on the website, <a href="http://www.kuwata-lab.com/tenjin/" rel="nofollow">Tenjin</a> is supposedly blazingly fast compared to the competition.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>I think Cheetah might be the fastest, as it's implemented in C.</p>
