<h3>Question (ID-8789172):</h3><h2>Temporary directory persist across program runs</h2><p>I need a temporary directory, but I want full control over its creation and deletion.</p>

<p>I will use this directory to place git repositories which I want to monitor for new commits, so I need to store them somewhere permanently.</p>

<p>Therefore I want to avoid <code>/tmp</code> dir, since it can be cleared by user(?). What is the best practice for this?</p>

It will create it in <code>/tmp</code> by default (on Unix-like systems), but "in the most secure manner possible" and with read/write/list permissions only for the caller's user id.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; d = tempfile.mktemp()
&gt;&gt;&gt; with open(os.path.join(d, "secret")) as output:
...     output.write("Ha, you can't read this!")
</code></pre>

<p>(Btw., on a Unix/Linux system with default settings, users can't just edit or remove each others' files from <code>/tmp</code>.)</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I'd say that the best practice is to use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.mkdtemp" rel="nofollow"><code>tempfile.mkdtemp</code></a>.</p>

<p>If you don't wan to use <code>/tmp</code> then, you can take advantage of the <code>prefix</code> parameter:</p>

<pre><code>import tempfile
tempfile.mkdtemp(prefix=&lt;your_preferred_directory&gt;)
</code></pre>

<p>Edit: Regarding what's the most appropriate directory to sotre your application configuration, cache data, etc. If you're using linux, please have a look at the <a href="http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html" rel="nofollow">XDG Base Directory Specification</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If it's really temporary, follow larmans' advice and use <code>mkdtemp</code>. </p>

<p>If it's some sort of semi-permanent cache that must survive reboots, then you should use the local application directory, as defined by your OS (%APPDATA%, ~/.local/ etc); some toolkits (e.g. Qt) provide functions to look that folder up in a cross-platform manner.</p>

<p>Edit: from Wikipedia:</p>

<ul>
<li>HOME (Unix-like) and USERPROFILE (Microsoft Windows) - indicate where
a user's home directory is located in the file system.</li>
<li>HOME/{.AppName} (Unix-like) and APPDATA{DeveloperName\AppName}
(Microsoft Windows) - for storing application settings. Many open
source programs incorrectly use USERPROFILE for application settings
in Windows - USERPROFILE should only be used in dialogs that allow
user to choose between paths like Documents/Pictures/Downloads/Music,
<strong>for programmatic purposes use APPDATA (roaming), LOCALAPPDATA or
PROGRAMDATA (shared between users)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>So you should look up <code>os.environ['APPDATA']</code> or <code>os.environ['HOME']</code>, depending on platform (see <code>sys.platform</code>) and then append your app name, and then you can store there anything you want.</p>

<pre><code>mydir = os.path.join( ".myAppName", "cache")
homeVar = 'HOME'  # default for all *nix variants
if sys.platform == 'win32': 
   homeVar = 'APPDATA'
mydir = os.path.join( os.environ[homeVar], mydir)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p><a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/appdirs" rel="nofollow">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/appdirs</a> is a Python module that offers a cross-platform <code>user_cache_dir</code> function.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Usually programs use a <code>~/.progname</code> directory to store data that should be persistent but should stay "out of the way" of the user. </p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Just a though: You may want to look into git <a href="http://bit.ly/wDgniE" rel="nofollow">commit hooks</a>. That way, instead of monitoring a tmp directory for new commits (sounds strange: who would commit into a tmp directory with limited permissions?) the repo informs you about commits, or, more specifically, automatically runs a script whenever a commit occurs..</p>
