<h3>Question (ID-1547365):</h3><h2>A database for python 3?</h2><p>I'm coding a small piece of server software for the personal use of several users. Not hundreds, not thousands, but perhaps 3-10 at a time.</p>

<p>Since it's a threaded server, SQLite doesn't work. It complains about threads like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ProgrammingError: SQLite objects created in a thread can only be used in that same thread.The object was created in thread id 140735085562848 and this is thread id 4301299712</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Besides, they say SQLite isn't great for concurrency anyhow.</p>

<p>Now since I started working with Python 3 (and would rather continue using it) I can't seem to get the MySQL module to work properly and others seem equally frustrated.</p>

<p>In that case, is there any other DB option for Python 3 that I could consider?</p>

<p>Then just make sure you open a new handle to the database in each thread.</p>

<p>I do this using thread local storage to cache the database handle so there is only one per thread.  Something like this... (from a py2.5 prog - hopefully it will work with 3.0!)</p>

<pre><code>import threading

class YourClass:
    def __init__(self):
        #...
        self.local = threading.local()  # Thread local storage for db handles
        self.db_file = "/path/to/db"
        #...
    def db_open(self):
        if not getattr(self.local, "db", None):
            self.local.db = sqlite3.connect(self.db_file)
        return self.local.db

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You could create a new sqlite object in each thread, each using the same database file. For such a small number of users you might not come across the problems with concurrency, unless they are all writing to it very heavily.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Surely a pragmatic option is to just use one SQLite connection per thread.</p>
