<h3>Question (ID-5459896):</h3><h2>Low volume Open source Message Board suggestions?</h2><p>Looking for a low volume, probably no more that 20-30 users, Open Source message/bulletin board.  Obviously must be written in something which our web server supports, PHP/Python/Ruby etc.  Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Thanks,
  Nick</p>

<p>and lots more. The above are designed to handle very large boards, but can be used with low traffic websites. All PHP</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>PhpBB <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhpBB" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhpBB</a> free and open Source, requires MySQL. Great for running on run-of-the-mill LAMP configurations. </p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I would use <a href="http://vanillaforums.org/" rel="nofollow">Vanilla forums</a> in your case. It has a great API for integrating into other projects as well.</p>

<p>Or if you prefer the more traditional forum layout see <a href="http://punbb.informer.com/" rel="nofollow">PunBB</a>.</p>

<p>I would <strong>not</strong> recommend phpBB for a low volume forum as it is more complicated to setup and maintain. It is also a much larger app and not lightweight at all.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>PhpBB is an excellent. It's very easy to set up and has many great features, but it is more difficult to customize right out of the box. For a superfast "community" solution, try using WordPress with the BuddyPress plugin.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I can recommend MyLittleForum. It's actually not a board, but a forum, but one of the views (with compacted threads) looks pretty much board-like. <a href="http://mylittleforum.net/forum/index.php?mode=index" rel="nofollow">http://mylittleforum.net/forum/index.php?mode=index</a></p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Thanks for all the suggestions.</p>

<p>However can any of these actually be integrated into our existing website rather than having to integrate our website into the BB architecture.</p>

<p>Basically I want to keep our existing website Header, Menu, QuickLinks panel, Footer (floating) etc.  I want to embed the Message Forum and all its screens into a main  within our existing site layout.  Is this possible?</p>

<p>I have tried installing both phpBB and myBB but neither of them seem to allow full integration within our website.</p>
