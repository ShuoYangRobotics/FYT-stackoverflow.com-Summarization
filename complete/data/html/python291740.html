<h3>Question (ID-291740):</h3><h2>How do I split a huge text file in python</h2><p>I have a huge text file (~1GB) and sadly the text editor I use won't read such a large file.  However, if I can just split it into two or three parts I'll be fine, so, as an exercise I wanted to write a program in python to do it.  </p>

<p>What I think I want the program to do is to find the size of a file, divide that number into parts, and for each part, read up to that point in chunks, writing to a <em>filename</em>.nnn output file, then read up-to the next line-break and write that, then close the output file, etc.  Obviously the last output file just copies to the end of the input file.</p>

<p>Can you help me with the key filesystem related parts: filesize, reading and writing in chunks and reading to a line-break?</p>

<p>I'll be writing this code test-first, so there's no need to give me a complete answer, unless its a one-liner ;-)</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Check out <code>os.stat()</code> for file size and <code>file.readlines([sizehint])</code>. Those two functions should be all you need for the reading part, and hopefully you know how to do the writing :)</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>linux has a split command</p>

<p>split -l 100000 file.txt</p>

<p>would split into files of equal 100,000 line size</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You can use <code>wc</code> and <code>split</code> (see the respective manpages) to get the desired effect.  In <code>bash</code>:</p>

<pre><code>split -dl$((`wc -l 'filename'|sed 's/ .*$//'` / 3 + 1)) filename filename-chunk.
</code></pre>

<p>produces 3 parts of the same linecount (with a rounding error in the last, of course), named <code>filename-chunk.00</code> to <code>filename-chunk.02</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I've written the program and it seems to work fine.  So thanks to Kamil Kisiel for getting me started.<br />
(Note that FileSizeParts() is a function not shown here)<br />
Later I may get round to doing a version that does a binary read to see if its any quicker.</p>

<pre><code>def Split(inputFile,numParts,outputName):
    fileSize=os.stat(inputFile).st_size
    parts=FileSizeParts(fileSize,numParts)
    openInputFile = open(inputFile, 'r')
    outPart=1
    for part in parts:
        if openInputFile.tell()&lt;fileSize:
            fullOutputName=outputName+os.extsep+str(outPart)
            outPart+=1
            openOutputFile=open(fullOutputName,'w')
            openOutputFile.writelines(openInputFile.readlines(part))
            openOutputFile.close()
    openInputFile.close()
    return outPart-1
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>This generator method is a (slow) way to get a slice of lines without blowing up your memory.</p>

<pre><code>def slicefile(filename, start, end):
    for i, line in enumerate(open(filename)):
        if i &gt;= end:
            return
        if start &lt;= i:
            yield line

out = open("/blah.txt", "w")
for line in slicefile("/python26/readme.txt", 10, 15):
    out.write(line)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>don't forget <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#file.seek" rel="nofollow">seek()</a> and <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/mmap.html" rel="nofollow">mmap()</a> for random access to files.</p>

<pre><code>def getSomeChunk(filename, start, len):
    fobj = open(filename, 'r+b')
    m = mmap.mmap(fobj.fileno(), 0)
    return m[start:start+len]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Or, a python version of wc and split:</p>

<pre><code>lines = 0
for l in open(filename): lines += 1
</code></pre>

<p>Then some code to read the first lines/3 into one file, the next lines/3 into another , etc.</p>
