<h3>Question (ID-1389082):</h3><h2>IPv6 address validation and canonicalization</h2><p>What libs have you used for that?  How compatible are they with one another?  Or did you write your own parsing routine?</p>

<p>I'm particularly interested in mutually-compatible implementations for Java, C++, Python, and JavaScript, which support:</p>

<ul>
<li>zero compression ("<code>::</code>")</li>
<li>IPv4-mapped addresses ("<code>::ffff:123.45.67.89</code>")</li>
<li>canonicalization (including to the short form, for human readability)</li>
<li>CIDR-style netmasks (like "<code>/64</code>" at the end)</li>
</ul>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>On POSIX systems you can use <code>inet_pton</code> and <code>inet_ntop</code> in combination to do canonicalization.  You will still have to do your own CIDR parsing.  Fortunately, I believe the only valid CIDR syntax for IPv6 is the /number_of_bits notation, so that's fairly easy.</p>

<p>The other issue you will run into is the lack of support for interface specifications.  For link-local addresses, you will see things like <code>%eth0</code> on the end to specify what link they are local too.  <code>getaddrinfo</code> will parse that but <code>inet_pton</code> won't.</p>

<p>One strategy you could go for is using <code>getaddrinfo</code> to parse and <code>inet_ntop</code> to canonicalize.</p>

<p><code>getaddrinfo</code> is available for Windows.  <code>inet_pton</code> and <code>inet_ntop</code> aren't.  Fortunately, it isn't too hard to write code to produce a canonical form IPv6 address.  It will require two passes though because the rule for 0 compression is the biggest string of 0s that occurs first.  Also IPv4 form (i.e. <code>::127.0.0.1</code>) is only used for <code>::IPv4</code> or <code>::ffff:IPv4</code>.</p>

<p>I have no Windows machine to test with, but from the documentation it appears that Python on Windows supports <code>inet_pton</code> and <code>inet_ntop</code> in its socket module.</p>

<p>Writing your own routine for producing a canonical form might not be a bad idea, since even if your canonical form isn't the same as everybody else's, as long as it's valid other people can parse it.  But I would under no circumstances write a routine of your own to <strong>parse</strong> IPv6 addresses.</p>

<p>My advice above is good for Python, C, and C++.  I know little or nothing about how to solve this problem in Java or Javascript.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I have been examining getaddrinfo and its counterpart, getnameinfo.  These are in almost all ways better than <code>inet_pton</code> and <code>inet_ntop</code>.  They are thread safe, and you can pass them options (<code>AI_NUMERICHOST</code> in <code>getaddrinfo</code>'s case, and <code>NI_NUMERCHOST</code> in <code>getnameinfo</code>'s case) to keep them from doing any kind of DNS queries.  Their interface is a little complex and reminds me of an ugly Windows interface in some respects, but it's fairly easy to figure out what options to pass to get what you want.  I heartily recommend them both.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>In Java, You could use </p>

<pre><code>InetAddress.getByName(IP)
</code></pre>

<p>and then check for exceptions thrown by this for validating IPv6 addresses</p>

<p>You could also use Sun Propreitary API if thats oK to you. THis will not perform a DNS lookup. ( They might change it/remove it without notice since its their propreitary API.This is a warning that will come when compiling a code using this )</p>

<pre><code>boolean sun.net.util.IPAddressUtil.isIPv6LiteralAddress(String IP)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I wrote <a href="https://github.com/beaugunderson/javascript-ipv6" rel="nofollow">javascript-ipv6</a> for this very purpose. It currently powers <a href="http://www.v6decode.com/" rel="nofollow">v6decode.com</a>.</p>

<p>Here's a short example of the API:</p>

<pre><code>var address = new v6.Address("::ffff:7b2d:4359/64");

if (address.isValid()) {
   // Do something if the address is valid
}

console.log(address.correctForm());         // "::ffff:7b2d:4359"
console.log(address.canonicalForm());       // "0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:ffff:7b2d:4359"
console.log(address.v4Form());              // "::ffff:123.45.67.89"
console.log(address.subnetMask);            // "64"
console.log(address.possibleAddresses(96)); // "4,294,967,296"
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>From what I can gather, you should use <code><a href="http://linux.die.net/man/3/getaddrinfo" rel="nofollow">getaddrinfo()</a></code> on systems that have it, i.e. Linux and POSIX places. There should be no need to write your own low-level parser.</p>

<p>Windows <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms738520%28VS.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">also provides</a> <code>getaddrinfo()</code>, on XP and later.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>For Python, the best solution might be IPy (<a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/IPy/0.51" rel="nofollow">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/IPy/0.51</a>)</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>getaddrinfo already returns the shortest textual form, so if you have the longer form you can canonicalize by running through getaddrinfo again.  Example Python,</p>

<pre><code>import sys, socket;
result = socket.getaddrinfo('0:0::0:1', None);
print "family:%i socktype:%i proto:%i canonname:%s sockaddr:%s"%result[0];
</code></pre>

<p>Outputs the following,</p>

<pre><code>family:10 socktype:1 proto:6 canonname: sockaddr:('::1', 0, 0, 0)
</code></pre>

<p>IPv6 CIDR blocks don't appear to be well documented or defined so I wrote my own <a href="http://code.google.com/p/openpgm/source/browse/trunk/openpgm/pgm/inet_network.c" rel="nofollow">inet6_network implementation</a> to handle that (C99).</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I use a regular expression when os support may not be available - RE is available in most languages, including C/C++/Java/Python/Perl/bash/....  The following python code builds the RE at startup, the resulting RE source is a humdinger - but once compiled by the re engine is as fast as native code.</p>

<pre><code>PAT_IP4 = r'\.'.join([r'(?:\d|[1-9]\d|1\d\d|2[0-4]\d|25[0-5])']*4)
RE_IP4 = re.compile(PAT_IP4+'$')
RE_IP6 = re.compile(                 '(?:%(hex4)s:){6}%(ls32)s$'
               '|::(?:%(hex4)s:){5}%(ls32)s$'
              '|(?:%(hex4)s)?::(?:%(hex4)s:){4}%(ls32)s$'
'|(?:(?:%(hex4)s:){0,1}%(hex4)s)?::(?:%(hex4)s:){3}%(ls32)s$'
'|(?:(?:%(hex4)s:){0,2}%(hex4)s)?::(?:%(hex4)s:){2}%(ls32)s$'
'|(?:(?:%(hex4)s:){0,3}%(hex4)s)?::%(hex4)s:%(ls32)s$'
'|(?:(?:%(hex4)s:){0,4}%(hex4)s)?::%(ls32)s$'
'|(?:(?:%(hex4)s:){0,5}%(hex4)s)?::%(hex4)s$'
'|(?:(?:%(hex4)s:){0,6}%(hex4)s)?::$'
  % {
'ls32': r'(?:[0-9a-f]{1,4}:[0-9a-f]{1,4}|%s)'%PAT_IP4,
'hex4': r'[0-9a-f]{1,4}'
}, re.IGNORECASE)

<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>It's too bad Python 3.1 lost the ipaddr lib.</p>

<p>It's still available as a third-party library: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ipaddr-py/" rel="nofollow">py-ipaddr</a> available on <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ipaddr" rel="nofollow">PyPI</a>.</p>

<h2>Compression</h2>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; ipaddr.IPv6Address('0:0::0:1').compressed

<h2>IPv4 mapping</h2>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; ipaddr.IPv6Address('::ffff:123.45.67.89').ipv4_mapped
IPv4Address('123.45.67.89')
</code></pre>

<h2>CIDR</h2>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; ipaddr.IPv6Network('::ffff:123.45.67.89/128')
