<h3>Question (ID-594442):</h3><h2>Choosing between different switch-case replacements in Python - dictionary or if-elif-else?</h2><p>I recently read the questions that recommend against using switch-case statements in languages that do support it. As far as Python goes, I've seen a number of switch case replacements, such as:  </p>

<ol>
<li>Using a dictionary (Many variants)  </li>
<li>Using a Tuple  </li>
<li>Using a function decorator (<a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/440499/">http://code.activestate.com/recipes/440499/</a>)  </li>
<li>Using Polymorphism (Recommended method instead of type checking objects)  </li>
<li>Using an if-elif-else ladder  </li>
<li>Someone even recommended the Visitor pattern (Possibly Extrinsic)  </li>
</ol>

<p>Given the wide variety of options, I am having a bit of difficulty deciding what to do for a particular piece of code. I would like to learn the criteria for selecting one of these methods over the other in general. In addition, I would appreciate advice on what to do in the specific cases where I am having trouble deciding (with an explanation of the choice).</p>

<p>Here is the specific problem:<br />
(1)  </p>

<pre><code>def _setCurrentCurve(self, curve):
        if curve == "sine":
            self.currentCurve =  SineCurve(startAngle = 0, endAngle = 14,
            lineColor = (0.0, 0.0, 0.0), expansionFactor = 1,
            centerPos = (0.0, 0.0))
        elif curve == "quadratic":
            self.currentCurve = QuadraticCurve(lineColor = (0.0, 0.0, 0.0))
</code></pre>

<p>This method is called by a <strong>qt-slot</strong> in response to choosing to draw a curve from a menu. The above method will contain a total of 4-7 curves once the application is complete. Is it justified to use a throw away dictionary in this case? Since the most obvious way to do this is if-elif-else, should I stick with that? I have also consider using **kargs here (with a friends help) since all the curve classes use **kargs...</p>

<p>(2)<br />
This second piece of code is a <strong>qt-slot</strong> that is called when the user changes a property of a curve. Basically the slot takes the data from the gui (spinBox) and puts it in an instance variable of the appropriate curve class. In this case, I again have the same question - should I use a dict?</p>

<p>Here is the aforementioned slot- </p>

<pre><code>def propertyChanged(self, name, value):
    """A Qt slot, to react to changes of SineCurve's properties."""
    if name == "amplitude":
        self.amplitude = value
    elif name == "expansionFactor":
        self.expansionFactor = value
    elif name == "startAngle":
        self.startAngle = value
    elif name == "endAngle":
        self.endAngle = value
</code></pre>

<p>For reference, here is the code for connecting to the above slot -  </p>

<pre><code>def _connectToPage(self, page):
    for connectionData in page.getConnectibles():
        self.connect(connectionData["object"],
                    SIGNAL(connectionData["signal"]),
                    lambda value, name = connectionData["property"]:\
                        self.currentCurve.propertyChanged(name, value))
        self.connect(connectionData["object"],
                    SIGNAL(connectionData["signal"]),
                    self.hackedDisplayArea.update)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note</strong> - The self.endAngle etc. are initialized in the constructor.</p>

<p>As far as I know, the reasons for choosing a dict is for fast lookup. When is that warranted? when I have 100 cases or more? Is it a good idea to keep building and throwing away a dictionary each time the function is called? If I build a dict for this purpose outside a function, should I check If it is needed elswhere? What happens if it is not needed elsewhere?</p>

<p>My question is what is the best-practice if there is one? What is the best/most elegant way to go about things? Put in yet another way, when to use <strong>if-elif-else</strong>, when to use each of the other options?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Sigh.  Too much hand-wringing over the wrong part of the problem.  The switch statement is not the issue.  There are many ways of expressing "alternative" that don't add <strong>meaning</strong>.</p>

<p>The issue is <strong>meaning</strong> -- not technical statement choices. </p>

<p>There are three common patterns.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Mapping a key to an object</strong>.  Use a dictionary if it is almost totally static and you have a mapping between a simple key and another more complex thing.  Building a dictionary on the fly each time you need it is silly.  You can use this if it's what you <strong>mean</strong>: your "conditions" are simple, static key values that map to objects.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Variant behavior among subclasses</strong>.  Use Polymorphism instead of type checking objects.  Correct.  If you have similar objects in multiple classes with variant behavior, they should be polymorphic.  Use this as often as possible.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Other variant behavior</strong>.  Use an if-elif-else ladder.  Use this when you don't have largely static key-to-value mapping.  Use this when the conditions are complex, or you <strong>mean</strong> procedures, not objects.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Everything else is just tricky code that can achieve similar results.</p>

<p>Using a Tuple. This is just dictionary without the mapping.  This requires search, and search should be avoided whenever possible.  Don't do this, it's inefficient.  Use a dictionary.</p>

<p>Using a function decorator (<a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/440499/" rel="nofollow">http://code.activestate.com/recipes/440499/</a>).  Icky.  This conceals the if-elif-elif nature of the problem you're solving.  Don't do this, it isn't obvious that the choices are <em>exclusive</em>.  Use anything else.</p>

<p>Someone even recommended the <strong>Visitor</strong> pattern.  Use this when you have an object which follows the <strong>Composite</strong> design pattern.  This depends on polymorphism to work, so it's not really a different solution.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>In the first example I would certainly stick with the if-else statement. In fact I don't see a reason not to use if-else unless</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You find (using e.g. the profile module) that the if statement is a bottleneck (very unlikely IMO unless you have a huge number of cases that do very little)</p></li>
<li><p>The code using a dictionary is clearer / has less repetition. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Your second example I would actually rewrite</p>

<pre><code>setattr(self, name, value)
</code></pre>

<p>(probably adding an assert statement to catch invalid names).</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Considering that this is done in response to a user action (pickings something from a menu), and the number of choices you anticipate is very small, I'd definitely go with a simple if-elif-else ladder.</p>

<p>There's no point in optinizing for speed, since it only happens as fast as the user can make the selection anyway, this is not "inner loop of a raytracer"-territory. Sure, it matters to give the user quick feedback, but since the number of cases is so small, there is no danger of that either.</p>

<p>There's no point in optimizing for conciseness, since the (imo clearer, zero-readability-overhead) if-ladder will be so very short anyway.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Regarding your dictionary questions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As far as I know, the reasons for choosing a dict is for fast lookup. When is that warranted? when I have 100 cases or more? Is it a good idea to keep building and throwing away a dictionary each time the function is called? If I build a dict for this purpose outside a function, should I check If it is needed elswhere? What happens if it is not needed elsewhere?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Another issue is maintainability. Having the string->curveFunction dictionary allows you to data-drive the menu. Then adding another option is just a matter of putting another string->function entry in the dictionary (which lives in a part of the code dedicated to configuration.</p></li>
<li><p>Even if you have only a few entries, it "separates concerns"; <code>_setCurrentCurve</code> is responsible for wiring up at run time, not defining the box of components.</p></li>
<li><p>Build the dictionary and hold onto it.</p></li>
<li><p>Even if it's not used elsewhere, you get the above benefits (locatability, maintainability).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>My rule of thumb is to ask "What's going on here?" for each component of my code. If the answer is of the form</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... <strong>and</strong> ... <strong>and</strong> ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(as in "defining the library of functions <strong>and</strong> associating each with a value in the menu") then there are some concerns begging to be separated.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Each of the exposed options fit well some scenarios:</p>

<ol>
<li>if-elif-else: simplicity, clarity</li>
<li>dictionary: useful when you configure it dynamically (imagine that you need a particular functionality to be executed on a branch)</li>
<li>tuple: simplicity over if-else case for multiple choices per branch.</li>
<li>polymorphism: automatic object oriented branching</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>Python is about readability and consistency and even if your decision will always be a subjective and it will depend on your style, you should always think about Python mantras.</p>

<p>./alex</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I agree with df regarding the second example. The first example I would probably try to rewrite using a dictionary, particularly if all the curve constructors have the same type signature (perhaps using *args and/or **kwargs). Something like</p>

<pre><code>def _setCurrentCurve(self, new_curve):
    self.currentCurve = self.preset_curves[new_curve](options_here)
</code></pre>

<p>or perhaps even</p>

<pre><code>def _setCurrentCurve(self, new_curve):
    self.currentCurve = self.preset_curves[new_curve](**preset_curve_defaults[new_curve])
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>In Python, don't event think about how to replace a switch statement.</p>

<p>Use classes and polymorphism instead. Try to keep the information about each availble choice and how to implement it in one place (i.e. the class that implements it).</p>

<p>Otherwise you will end up having lots of places that each contain a tiny fraction of each choice, and updating/extending will be a maintenance nightmare. </p>

<p>This is exactly the kind of problem that OOD tries to solve by abstraction, information hiding, polymorphism and the lot.</p>

<p>Think about what classes of objects you have and their properties, then create an OO architecture around them. This way you will never ever have to worry about a missing "switch" statement again.</p>
