<h3>Question (ID-521476):</h3><h2>Why True/False is capitalized in Python?</h2><p>All members are camel case, right? Why True/False but not true/false, which is more relaxed?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should the constants be called 'True'
  and 'False' (similar to
         None) or 'true' and 'false' (as in C++, Java and C99)?</p>
  
  <p>=> True and False.</p>
  
  <p>Most reviewers agree that consistency within Python is more
  important than consistency with other languages.</p>

<p>This, as Andrew points out, is probably because <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/constants.html">all (most)? built-in constants are capitalized</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/58640/great-programming-quotes/63120#63120">It's the way Guido indented it!</a></p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>All of python's <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/constants.html" rel="nofollow">built-in constants</a> are capitalized or [upper] CamelCase:</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Here's a <a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2007-May/440165.html" rel="nofollow">possible explaination</a>:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>I see that naming conventions are such that classes usually get named
    CamelCase. So why are the built-in types named all lowercase (like
    list, dict, set, bool, etc.)?</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>Because most of them originally were
  types and factory functions, not<br />
  classes - and a naming convention is
  not a strong reason to make backwards 
  incompatible changes. A different
  example: the new builtin type <code>set</code> is
  based on (altough not   exactly equal
  to) the Set class from the sets module</p>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I'd say that they're called <code>True</code> and <code>False</code> because they're singletons.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p><code>True</code> and <code>False</code> are capitalized in Haskell, the other language which uses indentation as syntax.</p>
