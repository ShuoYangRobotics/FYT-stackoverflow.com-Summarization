<h3>Question (ID-1893094):</h3><h2>Basic Python Numbers!</h2><p>Why does <code>0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 - 0.3</code> evaluates to
<code>5.5511151231257827e-17</code> in Python?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Because that's how floating point numbers work. If you want precise numbers, use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/decimal.html" rel="nofollow"><code>decimal</code></a> module. If you want to use floating point numbers, you have to remember to round them to a specific precision when you are displaying them.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print '%.2f' % (0.1+0.1+0.1-0.3,)
0.00
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>This is a problem with floating point numbers in general. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating%5Fpoint#Accuracy%5Fproblems" rel="nofollow">this section</a> on Wikipedia for a description. Roughly speaking - there are rounding errors. Notice that the number you gave us was very small - about 0.00000000000000005551115123 . Here is <a href="http://docs.sun.com/source/806-3568/ncg%5Fgoldberg.html" rel="nofollow">a more technical paper</a> about the subject.</p>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You might be interested in knowing that Python 3 has improved the situation by changing how <code>repr</code> works. It will now give you the shortest string representation that will be converted back to the original float:</p>

<pre>
Python 3.1.1+ (r311:74480, Oct 11 2009, 20:19:13) 
[GCC 4.3.4] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 0.1
'0.1'
</pre>

<p>Older versions behave like this:</p>

<pre>
Python 2.6.4 (r264:75706, Oct 28 2009, 22:19:17) 
[GCC 4.3.4] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 0.1
'0.10000000000000001'
</pre>

<p>It is only the output of <code>repr</code> (called implicitly when you enter a value in the interactive interpreter) that has changed. The underlying values are still IEEE-754 floating-point numbers, and they still have the usual limitations:</p>

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Because of the way floating points numbers are represented in a computer. It's not just a Python thing.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>As an example, consider representing 1/3 as a scientific number in base 10. With only a finite number of digits (say, 10), you'll wind up with a rounding error. Say 1/3 ≈ 0.3333333333e0. Then 1/3+1/3+1/3 (after first converting to decimal expansions) is represented as 0.9999999999e0, but 1 is 1.0e0. Similarly, 1/7 ≈ 0.1428571429e0, and 1/7+1/7 would be 0.2857142858e0, but the representation for 2/7 would be 0.2857142857e0. In both cases, the sum is off by 1e-10. </p>
