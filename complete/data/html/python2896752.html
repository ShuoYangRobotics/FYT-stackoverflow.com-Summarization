<h3>Question (ID-2896752):</h3><h2>Removing Item From List - during iteration - what's wrong with this idiom?</h2><p>As an experiment, I did this:</p>

<pre><code>letters=['a','b','c','d','e','f','g','h','i','j','k','l']
for i in letters:
    letters.remove(i)
print letters
</code></pre>

<p>The last print shows that not all items were removed ? (every other was).</p>

<pre><code>IDLE 2.6.2      
&gt;&gt;&gt; ================================ RESTART ================================
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
['b', 'd', 'f', 'h', 'j', 'l']
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>What's the explanation for this ? How it could this be re-written to remove every item ?</p>

<p>Because the Python language is designed to handle this use case differently. <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/controlflow.html" rel="nofollow">The documentation makes it clear:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is not safe to modify the sequence being iterated over in the loop (this can only happen for mutable sequence types, such as lists). <em>If you need to modify the list you are iterating over (for example, to duplicate selected items) you must iterate over a copy</em>.</p>

<p>You could easily understand why you got what you got, but it's basically <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_behavior" rel="nofollow">undefined behavior</a> that can easily change with no warning from build to build. Just don't do it.</p>

<p>It's like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/949433/could-anyone-explain-these-undefined-behaviors-i-i-i-i-i-etc">wondering why <code>i += i++ + ++i</code> does whatever the hell it is it that line does on your architecture on your specific build of your compiler for your language</a> -- including but not limited to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1998903/php-i-i-crashed-the-server">trashing your computer</a> and <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/N/nasal-demons.html" rel="nofollow">making demons fly out of your nose</a> :)</p>

<ul>
<li><code>del letters[:]</code> (if you need to change all references to this object)</li>
<li><code>letters[:] = []</code> (if you need to change all references to this object)</li>
<li><code>letters = []</code> (if you just want to work with a new object)</li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe you just want to remove some items based on a condition?  In that case, you should iterate over a copy of the list.  The easiest way to make a copy is to make a slice containing the whole list with the <code>[:]</code> syntax, like so:</p>

<pre><code>#remove unsafe commands
commands = ["ls", "cd", "rm -rf /"]
for cmd in commands[:]:
  if "rm " in cmd:
    commands.remove(cmd)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You cannot modify the list you are iterating, otherwise you get this weird type of result. To do this, you must iterate over a copy of the list:</p>

<pre><code>for i in letters[:]:
  letters.remove(i)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You cannot iterate over a list and mutate it at the same time, instead iterate over a slice:</p>

<pre><code>letters=['a','b','c','d','e','f','g','h','i','j','k','l']
for i in letters[:]: # note the [:] creates a slice
     letters.remove(i)
print letters
</code></pre>

<p>That said, for a simple operation such as this, you should simply use:</p>

<pre><code>letters = []
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>It removes the first occurrence, and then checks for the next number in the sequence. Since the sequence has changed it takes the next odd number and so on...</p>

<ul>
<li>take "a"</li>
<li>remove "a" -> the first item is now "b"</li>
<li>take the next item, "c"
-...</li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>what you want to do is:</p>

<pre><code>letters[:] = []
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>del letters[:]
</code></pre>

<p>This will preserve original object <code>letters</code> was pointing to. Other options like, <code>letters = []</code>, would create a new object and point <code>letters</code> to it: old object would typically be garbage-collected after a while.</p>

<p>The reason not all values were removed is that you're changing list while iterating over it.</p>

<p><strong>ETA</strong>: if you want to filter values from a list you could use list comprehensions like this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; letters=['a','b','c','d','e','f','g','h','i','j','k','l']
&gt;&gt;&gt; [l for l in letters if ord(l) % 2]
['a', 'c', 'e', 'g', 'i', 'k']
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Probably python uses pointers and the removal starts at the front. The variable „letters“ in the second line partially has a different value than tha variable „letters“ in the third line. When i is 1 then a is being removed, when i is 2 then b had been moved to position 1 and c is being removed. You can try to use „while“.</p>
