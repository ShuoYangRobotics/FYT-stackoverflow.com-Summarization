<h3>Question (ID-1635558):</h3><h2>Is there any Python module similar to Distributed Ruby</h2><p>I am new to Python. Just want to know is there any module in python similar to ruby's drb? Like a client can use object provided by the drb server?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>This is generally called "object brokering" and a list of some Python packages in this area can be found by browsing the Object Brokering topic area of the Python Package Index <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=browse&amp;c=405&amp;c=427" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>The oldest and most widely used of these is <a href="http://pyro.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">Pyro</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><a href="http://pyro.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">Pyro</a> does what I think you're discribing (although I've not used drb).</p>

<p>From the website:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pyro is short for PYthon Remote Objects. It is an advanced and powerful Distributed Object Technology system written entirely in Python, that is designed to be very easy to use. Never worry about writing network communication code again, when using Pyro you just write your Python objects like you would normally. With only a few lines of extra code, Pyro takes care of the network communication between your objects once you split them over different machines on the network. All the gory socket programming details are taken care of, you just call a method on a remote object as if it were a local object! </p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>The standard <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html" rel="nofollow">multiprocessing</a> module might do what you want.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I have no idea what drb is, but from the little information you have given,
it might be something like the <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/pb-intro.html" rel="nofollow">Perspective Broker in Twisted</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
  
  <p>Suppose you find yourself in control
  of both ends of the wire: you have two
  programs that need to talk to each
  other, and you get to use any protocol
  you want. If you can think of your
  problem in terms of objects that need
  to make method calls on each other,
  then chances are good that you can use
  twisted's Perspective Broker protocol
  rather than trying to shoehorn your
  needs into something like HTTP, or
  implementing yet another RPC
  mechanism.</p>
  
  <p>The Perspective Broker system
  (abbreviated PB, spawning numerous
  sandwich-related puns) is based upon a
  few central concepts:</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>serialization</em></strong>: taking fairly arbitrary
  objects and types, turning them into a
  chunk of bytes, sending them over a
  wire, then reconstituting them on the
  other end. By keeping careful track of
  object ids, the serialized objects can
  contain references to other objects
  and the remote copy will still be
  useful. </p>
  
  <p><strong><em>remote method calls</em></strong>: doing
  something to a local object and
  causing a method to get run on a
  distant one. The local object is
  called a RemoteReference, and you do
  something by running its .callRemote
  method.</p>
