<h3>Question (ID-6971819):</h3><h2>Find the numbers that can be made with addition and subtraction, using all numbers given</h2><p>I've profiled my application, and it spends 90% of its time in <code>plus_minus_variations</code>.</p>

<p>The function finds ways to make various numbers given a list of numbers using addition and subtraction.</p>

<p>For example:<br>
Input</p>

<pre><code>1, 2
</code></pre>

<p>Output</p>

<pre><code>1+2=3
1-2=-1
-1+2=1
-1-2=-3
</code></pre>

<p>This is my current code. I think it could be improved a lot in terms of speed.</p>

<pre><code>def plus_minus_variations(nums):
    result = dict()
    for i, ops in zip(xrange(2 ** len(nums)), \
            itertools.product([-1, 1], repeat=len(nums))):
        total = sum(map(operator.mul, ops, nums))
        result[total] = ops
    return result
</code></pre>

<p>I'm mainly looking for a different algorithm to approach this with. My current one seems pretty inefficient. However, if you have optimization suggestions about the code itself, I'd be happy to hear those too.</p>

<p>Additional: </p>

<ul>
<li>It's okay if the result is missing some of the answers (or has some extraneous answers) if it finishes a lot faster.</li>
<li><strong>If there are multiple ways to get a number, any of them are fine.</strong></li>
<li>For the list sizes I'm using, 99.9% of the ways produce duplicate numbers.</li>
<li>It's okay if the result doesn't have the way that the numbers were produced, if, again, it finishes a lot faster.</li>
</ul>

<p>Aha!<br>
Code is in Python 3,
inspired by tyz:</p>

<pre><code>from functools import reduce # only in Python 3

def process(old, num):
    new = set(map(num.__add__, old)) # use itertools.imap for Python 2
    new.update(map((-num).__add__, old))
    return new

def pmv(nums):
    n = iter(nums)
    x = next(n)
    result = {x, -x} # set([x, -x]) for Python 2
    return reduce(process, n, result)
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of split half and recursive, I use <code>reduce</code> to compute it one by one. that extremely reduced the times of function calls.</p>

<p>Take less than 1 sec to compute 256 numbers.</p>

<hr>

<p>Why product then mult?</p>

<pre><code>def pmv(nums):
    return {sum(i):i for i in itertools.product(*((num, -num) for num in nums))}
</code></pre>

<p>Can be faster without how the numbers were produced:</p>

<pre><code>def pmv(nums):
    return set(map(sum, itertools.product(*((num, -num) for num in nums))))
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>If it is ok not to get trace of number producing there is no reasons to recalculate sum of number combination every time. You can store intermediate results:</p>

<pre><code>def combine(l,r):
    res = set()
    for x in l:
        for y in r:
            res.add( x+y )
            res.add( x-y )
            res.add( -x+y )
            res.add( -x-y )
    return list(res)

def pmv(nums):
    if len(nums) &gt; 1:
        l = pmv( nums[:len(nums)/2] )
        r = pmv( nums[len(nums)/2:] )
        return combine( l, r )
    return nums
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: if the way of number generation is important you can use this variant:</p>

<pre><code>def combine(l,r):
    res = dict()
    for x,q in l.iteritems():
        for y,w in r.iteritems():
            if not res.has_key(x+y):
                res[x+y] = w+q
                res[-x-y] = [-i for i in res[x+y]]
            if not res.has_key(x-y):
                res[x-y] = w+[-i for i in q]
                res[-x+y] = [-i for i in res[x-y]]
    return res

def pmv(nums):
    if len(nums) &gt; 1:
        l = pmv( nums[:len(nums)/2] )
        r = pmv( nums[len(nums)/2:] )
        return combine( l, r )
    return {nums[0]:[1]}
</code></pre>

<p>My tests shows that it is still faster than the other solutions.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>This seems to be significantly faster for large random lists, I guess you could further micro-optimize it, but I prefer readability.</p>

<p>I chunk the list into smaller pieces and create variations for it. Since you get a lot less than <code>2 ** len(chunk)</code> variatons it's going to be faster. Chunk length is 6, you can play with it to see what's the optimal chunk length.</p>

<pre><code>def pmv(nums):
    chunklen=6
    res = dict()
    res[0] = ()
    for i in xrange(0, len(nums), chunklen):
        part = plus_minus_variations(nums[i:i+chunklen])
        resnew = dict()
        for (i,j) in itertools.product(res, part):
            resnew[i + j] = tuple(list(res[i]) + list(part[j]))
        res = resnew
    return res
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You can get something like a 50% speedup (at least for short lists) just by doing:</p>

<pre><code>from itertools import product, imap
from operator import mul

def plus_minus_variations(nums):
    result = {}
    for ops in product((-1, 1), repeat=len(nums)):
        result[sum(imap(mul, ops, nums))] = ops
    return result
</code></pre>

<p><code>imap</code> won't create intermediate lists you don't need. Importing into the local namespace saves the time attribute lookup takes. Tuples are faster than lists. Don't store unneeded intermediate items.</p>

<p>I tried this with a dict comprehension but it was a bit slower. I tried it with a set comprehension (not saving the <code>ops</code>) and it was the same speed.</p>

<p>I don't know why you were using <code>zip</code> and <code>xrange</code> at all... you weren't using the result in your calculation.</p>

<p>Edit: I get significant speedups with this version all the way up to the point where your version gives a memory error, not just for short lists.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>From a mathematical point of view you finally arive at all multiples of the greatest common divisor of your startvalues.</p>

<p>For example: </p>

<ul>
<li>startvalues 2,4. then the gcd(2,4) is 2, so the generated numbers are .. -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, ...</li>
<li>startvalues 3,5. then the gcd(3,5) is 1, you get all integers.</li>
<li>startvalues 12, 18, 15. the gcd(12,15,18) is 3, you get .. -6, -3, 0, 3, 6, ....</li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>This simple iterative method computes all possible sums. It could be about 5 times faster than the recursive method by @tyz.</p>

<pre><code>def pmv(nums):
    sums = set()
    sums.add(0)
    for i in range(0, len(nums)):
        partialsums = set()
        for s in sums:
            partialsums.add(s + nums[i])
            partialsums.add(s - nums[i])
        sums = partialsums
    return sums
</code></pre>
