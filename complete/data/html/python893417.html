<h3>Question (ID-893417):</h3><h2>item frequency count in python</h2><p>I'm a python newbie, so maybe my question is very noob.
Assume I have a list of words, and I want to find the number of times each word appears in that list.
Obvious way to do this is:</p>

<pre><code>words = "apple banana apple strawberry banana lemon"
uniques = set(words.split())
freqs = [(item, words.split.count(item)) for item in uniques]
print(freqs)
</code></pre>

<p>But I find this code not very good, because this way program runs through words list twice, once to build the set, and second time counting the number of appearances.
Of course, I could write a function to run through list and do the counting, but that wouldn't be so pythonic. So, is there a more efficient and pythonic way?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>If you are using python 2.7+/3.1+, there is a <a href="http://docs.python.org/dev/py3k/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow">Counter Class</a> in the collections module which is purpose built to solve this type of problem:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from collections import Counter
&gt;&gt;&gt; words = "apple banana apple strawberry banana lemon"
&gt;&gt;&gt; freqs = Counter(words.split())
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(freqs)
Counter({'apple': 2, 'banana': 2, 'strawberry': 1, 'lemon': 1})
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Since both 2.7 and 3.1 are still in beta it's unlikely you're using it, so just keep in mind that a standard way of doing this kind of work will soon be readily available.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><a href="http://docs.python.org/library/collections.html#defaultdict-objects" rel="nofollow">defaultdict</a> to the rescue!</p>

<pre><code>from collections import defaultdict

words = "apple banana apple strawberry banana lemon"

d = defaultdict(int)
for word in words.split():
    d[word] += 1
</code></pre>

<p>This runs in O(n).</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Standard approach:</p>

<pre><code>from collections import defaultdict

words = "apple banana apple strawberry banana lemon"
words = words.split()
result = collections.defaultdict(int)
for word in words:
    result[word] += 1

print result
</code></pre>

<p>Groupby oneliner:</p>

<pre><code>from itertools import groupby

words = "apple banana apple strawberry banana lemon"
words = words.split()

result = dict((key, len(list(group))) for key, group in groupby(sorted(words)))
print result
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>If you don't want to use the standard dictionary method (looping through the list incrementing the proper dict. key), you can try this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from itertools import groupby
&gt;&gt;&gt; myList = words.split() # ['apple', 'banana', 'apple', 'strawberry', 'banana', 'lemon']
&gt;&gt;&gt; [(k, len(list(g))) for k, g in groupby(sorted(myList))]
[('apple', 2), ('banana', 2), ('lemon', 1), ('strawberry', 1)]
</code></pre>

<p>It runs in O(n log n) time.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><pre><code>freqs = {}
for word in words:
    freqs[word] = freqs.get(word, 0) + 1 # fetch and increment OR initialize
</code></pre>

<p>I think this results to the same as Triptych's solution, but without importing collections. Also a bit like Selinap's solution, but more readable imho. Almost identical to Thomas Weigel's solution, but without using Exceptions.</p>

<p>This could be slower than using defaultdict() from the collections library however. Since the value is fetched, incremented and then assigned again. Instead of just incremented. However using += might do just the same internally.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Without defaultdict:</p>

<pre><code>words = "apple banana apple strawberry banana lemon"
my_count = {}
for word in words.split():
    try: my_count[word] += 1
    except KeyError: my_count[word] = 1
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Can't you just use count?</p>

<pre><code>words = 'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy gray dog'
words.count('z')
#output: 1
</code></pre>
