<h3>Question (ID-7662383):</h3><h2>how to check if you are at the end of a list in python?</h2><p>if have a list, say a=[1,2,3], and I want to see if a[4] is null, is there a way to do that? without using an exception or assertion.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p><a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#len" rel="nofollow"><code>len</code></a> will tell you the length of the list. To quote the docs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>len(s) <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return the length (the number of items) of an object. The argument may be a sequence <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(string, tuple or list) or a mapping (dictionary).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, if you want to get the final element in a <code>list</code>, <code>tuple</code>, or <code>string</code>, since indexes are 0 based, and the length of an item is the element count, <code>a[len(a)-1]</code> will be the last item. </p>

<hr>

<p>As an aside, generally, the proper way to access the last element in an object which allows numeric indexing (str, list, tuple, etc) is using <code>a[-1]</code>. Obviously, that does not involve <code>len</code> though.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You're not providing a specific use-case, but generally for a list your would use <code>len</code> to see how many elements are in the list.</p>

<pre><code>if len(a) &gt; 3:
    # Do something
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Use <code>len</code></p>

<pre><code>if len(a) &lt;= index:
   ...
</code></pre>

<p>Note:  Your question asks how you would find out "if <code>a[4]</code> is null".  <code>a[4]</code> isn't anything, which is why you get an <code>IndexError</code> when you try to check it.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The general way to check if you're currently looking at the element at the end of a list (in any language) is to compare the current index you're looking at with the length of the list minus one (since indexes start at 0).</p>

<p><code>a[4]</code> isn't really anything, because it doesn't exist - some languages may implement that as being null (or undefined) but many will simply throw an exception if you try to access it instead.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p><code>a[4]</code> in this case will throw a <code>IndexError</code> exception, which isn't the same as comparing the value of <code>a</code> at index 4 to <code>None</code>. You can have values of <code>None</code> in a list, and if you were to compare values of <code>a</code>, then when you encounter a <code>None</code>, it doesn't mean that the index is not found in the list.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a=[1,None,2]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[1]==None
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[3]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
IndexError: list index out of range
</code></pre>

<p>Since lists are contiguous and indexed sequentially, the correct way to check if an index is in a list is to compare it to the <code>len()</code> of a list, but depending on the application, there are other ways around it, like catching an <code>IndexError</code>, or iteration.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; for index, value in enumerate(a):
...     print index, value
... 
0 1
1 None
2 2
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I think the OP is asking for a way to find out if an index is within the range of valid values for a given list (or tuple, or string). For that, I'd use a check like this:</p>

<pre><code>if not lst or index &lt; 0 or index &gt;= len(lst):
    # the index is invalid, do something
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, in Python a negative index <em>is</em> valid, but it accesses elements from the end of the list counting backwards.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>with <code>a = [1,2,3]</code>  :</p>

<p><strong>a[2:3]</strong> is <strong>[3]</strong>  </p>

<p><strong>a[3:4]</strong> is <strong>[ ]</strong></p>

<p>So <strong>a[i:i+1] != [ ]</strong> tells if is an index of <strong>a</strong>  </p>

<p><strong>a[i:]</strong> does the same, but <strong>a[i:]</strong> creates another list, possible very long, while <strong>a[i:i+1]</strong> is 1 element if not empty</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>You could write a function which behaves kind of like <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#dict.get" rel="nofollow">dict.get()</a> does for dictionaries:</p>

<pre><code>def listget(list_, index, default=None):
    """Return the item for index if index is in the range of the list_,
    else default. If default is not given, it defaults to None, so that
    this method never raises an IndexError."""
    if index &gt;= len(list_) or index &lt; -len(list_):
        return default
    else:
        return list_[index]
</code></pre>

<p>Example usage:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; names = ["Mark","Frank","James"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; listget(names, 2)
'James'
&gt;&gt;&gt; listget(names,-3)
'Mark'
&gt;&gt;&gt; listget(names,3) # returns None
&gt;&gt;&gt; listget(names,4,0)
0
</code></pre>

<p>So it will always return a value and you get no exceptions.</p>
