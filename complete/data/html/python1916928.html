<h3>Question (ID-1916928):</h3><h2>convert byte array to string without interpreting the bytes?</h2><p>I have a GSM date/time stamp from a PDU encoded SMS it is formatted as so</p>

<p>\x90,\x21,\x51,\x91,\x40,\x33</p>

<p>format yy,mm,dd,hh,mm,ss</p>

<p>I have read them from a binary file into a byte array. I want to convert them to a string but without doing any decoding I want to end up with a string that contains 902151914033. I then need to reverse each 2 characters in the string.</p>

<p>Can anyone give me some pointers?
Many Thanks </p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>To convert to hex:</p>

<p><code>hexdata = ''.join('%02x' % ord(byte) for byte in bindata)</code></p>

<p>To reverse every other hex character (if I'm understanding correctly):</p>

<p><code>hexdata = ''.join(('%02x' % ord(byte))[::-1] for byte in bindata)</code></p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>This should get you started:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s = b'\x90\x21\x51\x91\x40\x33'
&gt;&gt;&gt; lst = [hex(z)[2:] for z in s]
&gt;&gt;&gt; lst
['90', '21', '51', '91', '40', '33']

&gt;&gt;&gt; string = ''.join(hex(z)[3:1:-1] for z in s)
&gt;&gt;&gt; string
'091215190433'
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>What you mean is that you <em>do</em> want to do some processing! The unprocessed bytes are most easily represented as characters.</p>

<p>I think what you want is something along the lines of:</p>

<pre><code>r = ''
for num in array:
    r += '%2X' % num
return r
</code></pre>

<p>Which I'm sure could be wrapped up in an anonymous function, if necessary.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>If, in your question, the string you have provided is the literal set of bytes (as ascii) including the \ and , and you wish to strip them out you could use the binascii module and str.replace:</p>

<pre><code>import binascii
qp = binascii.b2a_qp( bunchabytes )
plainstring = qp.replace( '\\x', '' ).replace( ',', '' )
</code></pre>

<p>The resultant plainstring will consist of only the digits.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Many thanks for all your replies.</p>

<p>lpthnc's solution is exactly what I wanted. I ahve run into one more problem though.</p>

<p>If the bytearray contains b'\x00\x00\x00</p>

<p>the conversion will return only 000</p>

<p>the digits need to stay as 000000 because the 0000 could represent the time 00:00</p>

<p>Could I also ask someone to explain lpthnc's solution as I am having trouble working out exactly how it does the conversion?</p>

<p>Many thanks for your patience</p>

    return type(bindata)(switcher[i] for i in bindata)
