<h3>Question (ID-1414130):</h3><h2>Django not sending emails to admins</h2><p>According to the <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/error-reporting/">documentation</a>, if <code>DEBUG</code> is set to <code>False</code> and something is provided under the <code>ADMINS</code> setting, Django will send an email whenever the code raises a 500 status code. I have the email settings filled out properly (as I can use send_mail fine) but whenever I intentionally put up erroneous code I get my 500.html template but no error email is sent. What could cause Django to not do this?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>In my case the cause was missing <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#std%3asetting-SERVER_EMAIL">SERVER_EMAIL</a> setting.</p>

<p>The default for SERVER_EMAIL is 'root@localhost'. But many of email servers including 
my email provider do not accept emails from such suspicious addresses. They silently drop the emails.</p>

<p>Changing the sender email address to 'django@my-domain.com' solved the problem. In settings.py:</p>

<pre><code>SERVER_EMAIL = 'django@my-domain.com'
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>My web hosting provider - Webfaction - only allows emails to be sent From an email that has been explicitly created in the administrator panel. Creating one fixed the problem.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Make sure your EMAIL_HOST and EMAIL_PORT are set up right in settings.py (these refer to your SMTP server). It might be assuming that you have an SMTP server running on localhost.</p>

<p>To test this locally, run Python's built-in test SMTP server:</p>

<pre><code>python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer localhost:1025
</code></pre>

<p>Then set these values in your settings.py</p>

<pre><code>EMAIL_HOST='localhost'
EMAIL_PORT=1025
</code></pre>

<p>Trigger a 500 error, and you should see the e-mail appear in the python smtpd terminal window.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Although it's been a while, here's my response, so that other people can benefit in the future.</p>

<p>In my case, what was preventing emails to be sent to the ADMINS list, when an error occured, was an application specific setting. I was using django-piston, which provides the setting attributes PISTON_EMAIL_ERRORS and PISTON_DISPLAY_ERRORS. Setting these accordingly, enabled the application server to notify my by mail, whenever piston would crash.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Try this</p>

<pre><code># ./manage shell
&gt;&gt;&gt; from django.core.mail import send_mail
&gt;&gt;&gt; send_mail('Subject here', 'Here is the message.', 'from@example.com',['to@example.com'], fail_silently=False)
</code></pre>

<p>With a to@example.com that you actually get email at.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>While likely not ideal, I have found using Gmail as the SMTP host works just fine. There is a useful guide at <a href="http://nathanostgard.com/archives/2007/7/2/gmail%5Fand%5Fdjango/" rel="nofollow">nathanostgard.com</a>.  </p>

<p>Feel free to post your relevant settings.py sections (including EMAIL_*, SERVER_EMAIL, ADMINS (just take out your real email), MANAGERS, and DEBUG) if you want an extra set of eyes to check for typos!</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Make sure you have DEBUG = False</p>
