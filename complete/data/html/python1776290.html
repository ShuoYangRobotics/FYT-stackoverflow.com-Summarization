<h3>Question (ID-1776290):</h3><h2>replacing Matlab with python</h2><p>i am a engineering student and i have to do a lot of numerical processing, plots, simulations etc. The tool that i use currently is Matlab. I use it in my university computers for most of my assignments. However, i want to know what are the free options available. </p>

<p>i have done some research and many have said that python is a worthy replacement for matlab in various scenarios. i want to know how to do all this with python. i am using a mac so how do i install the different python packages. what are those packages? is it really a viable alternative? what are the things i can and cannot do using this python setup? </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php" rel="nofollow">Enthought Python Distribution</a> which includes most scientific packages you are likely to need. Free for academic/non-commercial use.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.macports.org/" rel="nofollow">Macports</a> - up to date with latest releases, so <code>sudo port install py26-numpy py26-scipy py26-matplotlib py26-ipython</code> should get you started.</li>
<li><a href="http://macinscience.org/?page%5Fid=6" rel="nofollow">Scipy Superpack</a> - script to install recent svn versions of all the important packages.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've done exactly this (replace Matlab with Python) about 2 years ago and haven't looked back. The broadcasting in Python, more intuitive memory model and other Numpy advantages make numerical work a complete pleasure. Plus with f2py, cython it is incredibly easy to put inner loops in another language. <a href="http://www.scipy.org/NumPy%5Ffor%5FMatlab%5FUsers" rel="nofollow">This</a> is a good place to start - other impressive pages to provide motiviation are <a href="http://www.scipy.org/PerformancePython" rel="nofollow">PerformancePython</a> and <a href="http://www.scipy.org/ParallelProgramming" rel="nofollow">ParallelProgramming</a>. Be sure to understand Pythons "variable is a reference to an object" semantics... after that adjustment everything is plain sailing. One of the coolest things that beats matlab is in 2 lines I run over 8 cores... <code>p = Pool(8); res = p.map(analysis_function,list_of_data)</code> - MATLAB parallels toolboxes are so expensive I've yet to see a University that actually has them.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I've been programming with Matlab for about 15 years, and with Python for about 10. It usually breaks down this way:</p>

<p>If you can satisfy the following conditions:
    1. You primarily use matrices and matrix operations
    2. You have the money for a Matlab license
    3. You work on a platform that mathworks supports</p>

<p>Then, by all means, use Matlab. Otherwise, if you have data structures other than matrices, want an open-source option that allows you to deliver solutions without worrying about licenses, and need to build on platforms that mathworks does not support; then, go with Python.</p>

<p>The matlab language is clunky, but the user interface is slick. The Python language is very nice -- with iterators, generators, and functional programming tools that matlab lacks; however, you will have to pick and choose to put together a nice slick interface if you don't like (or can't use) SAGE.</p>

<p>I hope that helps.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Maybe you like <a href="http://www.sagemath.org/" rel="nofollow">sagemath</a>, which 'combines the power of many existing open-source packages into a common Python-based interface'. Here is a <a href="http://sagemath.org/doc/tutorial/tour.html" rel="nofollow">feature tour</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Try <a href="http://www.sagemath.org/" rel="nofollow">Sage</a> - it is designed as an open source replacement for Matlab, Mathematica etc.  It is implemented in Python and can be scripted with Python, but it also adds a lot of maths-specific features.  There is an <a href="http://www.sagemath.org/download-mac.html" rel="nofollow">installer for the Mac</a>, so you will not need to download lots of individual packages.</p>

<p>There is also <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/" rel="nofollow">GNU Octave</a> - another open source alternative to Mathematica/Matab that has its own programming language.  However I have not found any information on a Mac version (though I have not looked very hard).</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.pythonxy.com/foreword.php" rel="nofollow">python(x,y)</a> is quite powerful, but only for Windows or Linux so you'll have to use bootcamp or Linux. A more lightweight package for mathematics is <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">Matplotlib</a>, which basically adds plotting abilities to the Python language (better used together with <a href="http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/" rel="nofollow">IPython</a>).</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Duplicate of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/179904/what-is-matlab-good-for-why-is-it-so-used-by-universities-when-is-it-better-tha">this</a>.</p>

<p>My sense is that for pure numerical/linear algebra computations and visualization Matlab is a slightly more consistent development environment. Numpy/Scipy/Matplotlib feel, to me, a bit haphazard.  If you are building a full program -- to automate a system or display results on a webpage -- Python the advantage of being a real programming language first and foremost. But for interactive numerical processing I think Matlab still wins.  The lack of element wise infix operators in Python is one small example (<a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0225/" rel="nofollow">PEP 225</a>).  For statistical computing, data exploration and visualization, it is hard to beat <a href="http://www.r-project.org" rel="nofollow">R</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Try <strong>Ubuntu Linux</strong>. Install it on your Mac, I have it on all my Macs. Ubuntu has all required packages to work with numerical math and visualization. Then, you will need to install only 2 packages:</p>

<p>1) Install <strong>SciPy</strong>. It is open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering. It includes a lot of stuff, e.g. <strong>matplotlib</strong>, which is a python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms.</p>

<p>2) Install <strong>ipython</strong>. It has enhanced interactive Python shell. </p>

<p>In order to install them, you can use a simple shell command in the Terminal:</p>

<pre><code>aptitude install  python-scipy ipython
</code></pre>

<p>Remember, that all these programs are in the very intensive development and thanks to Ubuntu's Software Update you will always have all it up-to-date without reinstalling it. </p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>It would be great if the matlab to python conversion <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mat2py/" rel="nofollow">mat2py</a> project at sourcefourge took off.. </p>
