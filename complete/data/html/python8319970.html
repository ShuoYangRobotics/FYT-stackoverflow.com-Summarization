<h3>Question (ID-8319970):</h3><h2>comparing two files and writing the missing values to a file</h2><p>I have a problem when I try to compare two large files.  What I am trying to do is take a line from one file, search all the lines of another file for a match and if there isn't one, write that line to another file.  I was able to recreate the problem with the simple example below:</p>

<p><strong>file1.txt (contents</strong>)</p>

<pre><code>apple
banana
pear
peach
lime
</code></pre>

<p><strong>file_old.txt (contents)</strong></p>

<pre><code>lime
apple
pear
peach
</code></pre>

<p>Since I am looking for lines in file1 that are not in file_old, I would expect that 'banana' would be the only value to show in the output file.  But in the output file, "*fill_diff*", I am showing:</p>

<pre><code>apple
banana
banana
</code></pre>

<p>What is wrong with my code to try and produce the differences in a file?</p>

<pre><code>def main():

    file_old = open(r'C:\Users\test\Desktop\file_old.txt', 'r+')
    file_new = open(r'C:\Users\test\Desktop\file1.txt', 'r+')
    file_diff = open(r'C:\Users\test\Desktop\file_diff.txt', 'w')

    for each_line in file_new: 
        for every_line in file_old:
            if each_line == every_line:
                break
            file_diff.write(each_line)

    file_old.close()
    file_new.close()
    file_diff.close()

main()
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks!</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You can do this in O(n + n*log(n)) by sorting both files first and then iterate over both simultaneously.</p>

<pre><code># sort file1 and file2 on disk or in memory
while len(file1) &gt; 0 and len(file2) &gt; 0:
    while file1[0] &lt; file2[0]:
        diff.append(file1[0])
        file1 = file1[1:]
    while file1[0] &gt; file2[0]:
        diff.append(file2[0])
        file2 = file2[1:]
    while file1[0] == file2[0]:
        file1 = file1[1:]
        file2 = file2[1:]
diff = diff + file1 + file2 # add the rest to the diff
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You need to go back to the beginning of <code>file_old</code> at the beginning of each iteration of your loop. Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>for each_line in file_new:
    file_old.seek(0)
    for every_line in file_old:
        ...
</code></pre>

<p>Also, the logic of your innermost loop seems wrong. I think you want something like</p>

<pre><code>for each_line in file_new:
    file_old.seek(0)
    found = False
    for every_line in file_old:
        if each_line == every_line:
            found = True
            break

    if not found:
        file_diff.write(each_line)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>FWIW, the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/difflib.html#module-difflib" rel="nofollow">difflib module</a> was designed for this kind of use case.</p>

<p>If you need to do it manually, Python's sets can make it easier:</p>

<pre><code>file_diff = open(r'C:\Users\test\Desktop\file_diff.txt', 'w')
oldlines = set(open(r'C:\Users\test\Desktop\file_old.txt', 'r'))
for line in open(r'C:\Users\test\Desktop\file1.txt', 'r'):
    if line not in oldlines:
        file_diff.write(line)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>srgerg's answer will work.</p>

<p>However, reading through files multiple times will have a very large runtime complexity. Therefore, if the files (though large) are small enough to fit into memory, then you might consider putting all the lines in <code>file_old</code> into a data structure for comparison:</p>

<pre><code>old_lines = set((line.strip() for line in open(r'C:\Users\test\Desktop\file_old.txt', 'r+')))
file_new = open(r'C:\Users\test\Desktop\file1.txt', 'r+')
file_diff = open(r'C:\Users\test\Desktop\file_diff.txt', 'w')

for line in file_new:
    if line.strip() not in old_lines:
        file_diff.write(line)
file_new.close()
file_diff.close()
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I suspect you want missing lines <em>in any order</em>?</p>

<p>This is a quick and dirty implementation based on <code>set()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>def readfile(name):
    afile = open(name, 'r+')
    lines = set([l.strip() for l in afile])
    afile.close()
    return lines

def main():
    oldset = readfile(r'file_old.txt')
    newset = readfile(r'file1.txt')

    file_diff = open(r'file_diff.txt', 'w')

    for diff in (newset - oldset):
        file_diff.write(diff)

    file_diff.close()

main()
</code></pre>

<p>This may not scale too well for very large input files.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>If you can't assume the files are sorted, then I'd do something like this</p>

<pre><code>def diffUnsorted(fn1, fn2) :
    return set([l.strip() for l in open(fn1) if l.strip() != ""]) - \
           set([l.strip() for l in open(fn2) if l.strip() != ""])
</code></pre>

<p>If you're going to be dealing with large files though, I'd go with a solution that sorts the files first, which gets you O(n) time and O(1) space (not counting the sorting..).</p>
