<h3>Question (ID-7451619):</h3><h2>Is there a JavaScript (ECMAScript) implementation written in Python?</h2><p>Are there any JavaScript (ECMAScript) implementations written in <strong>pure</strong> Python? It is okay even if its implementation is very slow.</p>

<p>Seems like a binding to V8 (JavaScript interpreter in Google Chromium) is available also, <a href="http://www.advogato.org/article/985.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.advogato.org/article/985.html</a></p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>There is one, of an unknown level of completeness, written in RPython (a subset of Python, that is to say, it runs as normal Python): <a href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/lang-js/overview" rel="nofollow">https://bitbucket.org/pypy/lang-js/overview</a></p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You may want to take a look at <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pydermonkey" rel="nofollow">pydermonkey</a> or <a href="http://code.google.com/p/python-spidermonkey/" rel="nofollow">python-spidermonkey</a>, both of which, I believe, are python implementations of the Mozilla javascript interpreter.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I would recommend that you just stick to node.js on your local development box, translate your CoffeeScript files over to JavaScript, and deploy the translated scripts with your apps. </p>

<p>I get that you want to avoid having node.js on your servers, that's all fair and good. Jumping through hoops with Python invoking JavaScript to translate CoffeeScript seems more hassle to me than it's worth.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Perhaps <a href="http://pyjs.org/" rel="nofollow">Pyjamas</a> could be an option for you?! <a href="http://pyjs.org/" rel="nofollow">Pyjamas</a> is a Python-to-JavaScript compiler similar to the Google Web Toolkit.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Have you heard of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pyv8/" rel="nofollow">PyV8</a>? It's a Python wrapper of Google's V8 JavaScript engine. It may be what you're looking for.</p>
