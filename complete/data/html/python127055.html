<h3>Question (ID-127055):</h3><h2>Find out number of capture groups in Python regular expressions</h2><p>Is there a way to determine how many capture groups there are in a given regular expression?</p>

<p>I would like to be able to do the follwing:</p>

<pre><code>def groups(regexp, s):
    """ Returns the first result of re.findall, or an empty default

    &gt;&gt;&gt; groups(r'(\d)(\d)(\d)', '123')
    ('1', '2', '3')
    &gt;&gt;&gt; groups(r'(\d)(\d)(\d)', 'abc')
    ('', '', '')
    """
    import re
    m = re.search(regexp, s)
    if m:
        return m.groups()
    return ('',) * num_of_groups(regexp)
</code></pre>

<p>This allows me to do stuff like:</p>

<pre><code>first, last, phone = groups(r'(\w+) (\w+) ([\d\-]+)', 'John Doe 555-3456')
</code></pre>

<p>However, I don't know how to implement <code>num_of_groups</code>. (Currently I just work around it.)</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Following the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/127055/find-out-number-of-capture-groups-in-python-regular-expressions/127089#127089">advice from rslite</a>, I replaced <code>re.findall</code> with <code>re.search</code>. </p>

<p><code>sre_parse</code> seems like the most robust and comprehensive solution, but requires tree traversal and appears to be a bit heavy.</p>

<p>MizardX's regular expression seems to cover all bases, so I'm going to go with that.</p>

    pattern = re.compile(r"(?&lt;!\\)(?:\\\\)*(?:\[(?:\\.|[^\\\]])*\]|(\()(?!\?(?!P&lt;)))")
    return len([ 1 for x in re.finditer(pattern, regex) if x.group(1) ])
</code></pre>

<p>It looks for unescaped '[' or '('. For '[' it looks for the next unescaped ']'. The '(' can't be followed by a '?', unless that is followed by 'P&lt;'. (Named groups.)
It then filters for the capturing groups, and counts them.</p>

<p>Also looking for character classes is necessary, because '(' can appear unescaped inside them. Using look-arounds to detect them is not possible, since look-behinds need to be of fixed length.</p>

<p>Too simple!</p>

<pre><code>def num_groups(regex):
    return re.compile(regex).groups
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Something from inside sre_parse might help.</p>

<p>At first glance, maybe something along the lines of:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import sre_parse
&gt;&gt;&gt; sre_parse.parse('(\d)\d(\d)')
[('subpattern', (1, [('in', [('category', 'category_digit')])])), 
('in', [('category', 'category_digit')]), 
('subpattern', (2, [('in', [('category', 'category_digit')])]))]
</code></pre>

<p>I.e. count the items of type 'subpattern':</p>

<pre><code>import sre_parse

def count_patterns(regex):
    """
    &gt;&gt;&gt; count_patterns('foo: \d')
    0
    &gt;&gt;&gt; count_patterns('foo: (\d)')
    1
    &gt;&gt;&gt; count_patterns('foo: (\d(\s))')
    1
    """
    parsed = sre_parse.parse(regex)
    return len([token for token in parsed if token[0] == 'subpattern'])
</code></pre>

<p>Note that we're only counting root level patterns here, so the last example only returns 1. To change this, <em>tokens</em> would need to searched recursively.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>First of all if you only need the first result of re.findall it's better to just use re.search that returns a match or None.</p>

<p>For the groups number you could count the number of open parenthesis '(' except those that are escaped by '\'. You could use another regex for that:</p>

<pre><code>def num_of_groups(regexp):
    rg = re.compile(r'(?&lt;!\\)\(')
    return len(rg.findall(regexp))
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this doesn't work if the regex contains non-capturing groups and also if '(' is escaped by using it as '[(]'. So this is not very reliable. But depending on the regexes that you use it might help.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The <code>lastindex</code> property of the match object should be what you are looking for. See the <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/match-objects.html" rel="nofollow">re module docs</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Might be wrong, but I don't think there is a way to find the number of groups that would have been returned had the regex matched.  The only way I can think of to make this work the way you want it to is to pass the number of matches your particular regex expects as an argument.</p>

<p>To clarify though: When findall succeeds, you only want the first match to be returned, but when it fails you want a list of empty strings?  Because the comment seems to show all matches being returned as a list.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Using your code as a basis:</p>

<pre><code>def groups(regexp, s):
    """ Returns the first result of re.findall, or an empty default

    &gt;&gt;&gt; groups(r'(\d)(\d)(\d)', '123')
    ('1', '2', '3')
    &gt;&gt;&gt; groups(r'(\d)(\d)(\d)', 'abc')
    ('', '', '')
    """
    import re
    m = re.search(regexp, s)
    if m:
        return m.groups()
    return ('',) * len(m.groups())
</code></pre>
