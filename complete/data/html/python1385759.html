<h3>Question (ID-1385759):</h3><h2>Should __init__() call the parent class's __init__()?</h2><p>I'm used that in Objective-C I've got this construct:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)init {
    if (self = [super init]) {
        // init class
    }
    return self;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Should Python also call the parent class's implementation for <code>__init__</code>?</p>

<pre><code>class NewClass(SomeOtherClass):
    def __init__(self):
        SomeOtherClass.__init__(self)
        # init class
</code></pre>

<p>Is this also true/false for <code>__new__()</code> and <code>__del__()</code>?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> There's a very similar question: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/753640/inheritance-and-overriding-init-in-python">Inheritance and Overriding <code>__init__</code> in Python</a></p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>In Python, calling the super-class' <code>__init__</code> is optional. If you call it, it is then also optional whether to use the <code>super</code> identifier, or whether to explicitly name the super class:</p>

<pre><code>object.__init__(self)
</code></pre>

<p>In case of object, calling the super method is not strictly necessary, since the super method is empty. Same for <code>__del__</code>.</p>

<p>OTOH, for <code>__new__</code>, you should indeed call the super method, and use its return as the newly-created object - unless you explicitly want to return something different.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>If you need something from super's <code>__init__</code> to be done in addition to what is being done in the current class's <code>__init__,</code> you must call it yourself, since that will not happen automatically.  But if you don't need anything from super's <code>__init__,</code> no need to call it.  Example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class C(object):
    def __init__(self):
    	self.b = 1


&gt;&gt;&gt; class D(C):
    def __init__(self):
    	super().__init__()
    	self.a = 1


&gt;&gt;&gt; class E(C):
    def __init__(self):
    	self.a = 1


&gt;&gt;&gt; d = D()
&gt;&gt;&gt; d.a
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; d.b  # This works because of the call to super's init
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; e = E()
&gt;&gt;&gt; e.a
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; e.b  # This is going to fail since nothing in E initializes b...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;pyshell#70&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    e.b  # This is going to fail since nothing in E initializes b...
AttributeError: 'E' object has no attribute 'b'
</code></pre>

<p><code>__del__</code> is the same way, (but be wary of relying on <code>__del__</code> for finalization - consider doing it via the with statement instead).</p>

<p>I rarely use <code>__new__.</code>  I do all the initialization in <code>__init__.</code></p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><strong>Edit</strong>: (after the code change)<br />
There is no way for us to tell you whether you need or not to call your parent's <code>__init__</code> (or any other function). Inheritance obviously would work without such call. It all depends on the logic of your code: for example, if all your <code>__init__</code> is done in parent class, you can just skip child-class <code>__init__</code> altogether.</p>

<p>consider the following example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class A:
    def __init__(self, val):
    	self.a = val


&gt;&gt;&gt; class B(A):
    pass

&gt;&gt;&gt; class C(A):
    def __init__(self, val):
    	A.__init__(self, val)
    	self.a += val


&gt;&gt;&gt; A(4).a
4
&gt;&gt;&gt; B(5).a
5
&gt;&gt;&gt; C(6).a
12

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>There's no hard and fast rule. The documentation for a class should indicate whether subclasses should call the superclass method. Sometimes you want to completely replace superclass behaviour, and at other times augment it - i.e. call your own code before and/or after a superclass call.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> The same basic logic applies to any method call. Constructors sometimes need special consideration (as they often set up state which determines behaviour) and destructors because they parallel constructors (e.g. in the allocation of resources, e.g. database connections). But the same might apply, say, to the <code>render()</code> method of a widget.</p>

<p><strong>Further update:</strong> What's the OPP? Do you mean OOP? No - a subclass often needs to know <em>something</em> about the design of the superclass. Not the internal implementation details - but the basic contract that the superclass has with its clients (using classes). This does not violate OOP principles in any way. That's why <code>protected</code> is a valid concept in OOP in general (though not, of course, in Python).</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>IMO, you should call it. If your superclass is <code>object</code>, you should not, but in other cases I think it is exceptional not to call it. As already answered by others, it is very convenient if your class doesn't even have to override <code>__init__</code> itself, for example when it has no (additional) internal state to initialize.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>In Anon's answer:<br>
 <em>"If you need something from super's <code>__init__</code> to be done in addition to what is being done in the current class's <code>__init__</code> , you must call it yourself, since that will not happen automatically"</em>  </p>

<p>It's incredible: he is wording exactly the contrary of the principle of inheritance.</p>

<p>. </p>

<p>It is not that <em>"something from super's <code>__init__</code>  (...)  will not happen automatically"</em> , it is that it WOULD happen automatically, but it doesn't happen because the base-class' <code>__init__</code> is overriden by the definition of the derived-clas <code>__init__</code>    </p>

<p>So then, WHY defining a derived_class' <code>__init__</code> , since it overrides what is aimed at when someone resorts to inheritance ??    </p>

<p>It's because one needs to define something that is NOT done in the base-class' <code>__init__</code> , and the only possibility to obtain that is to put its execution in a derived-class' <code>__init__</code> function.<br>
In other words, <strong>one needs something in base-class' <code>__init__</code> in addition</strong> to what would be automatically done in the base-classe' <code>__init__</code> if this latter wasn't overriden.<br>
 NOT the contrary.   </p>

<p>.</p>

<p>Then, the problem is that the desired instructions present in the base-class' <code>__init__</code> are no more activated at the moment of instanciation. In order to offset this inactivation, something special is required: calling explicitly the base-class' <code>__init__</code> , in order to <strong>KEEP</strong> , NOT TO ADD, the initialization performed by the base-class' <code>__init__</code> .
That's exactly what is said in the official doc:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An overriding method in a derived class may in fact want to <strong>extend
  rather than simply replace the base class method</strong> of the same name.
  There is a simple way to call the base class method directly: just
  call BaseClassName.methodname(self, arguments).<br>
  <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/classes.html#inheritance" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/tutorial/classes.html#inheritance</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's all the story:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>when the aim is to KEEP the initialization performed by the base-class, that is pure inheritance, nothing special is needed, one must just avoid to define an <code>__init__</code> function in the derived class</p></li>
<li><p>when the aim is to REPLACE the initialization performed by the base-class, <code>__init__</code> must be defined in the derived-class</p></li>
<li><p>when the aim is to ADD processes to the initialization performed by the base-class, a derived-class' <code>__init__</code>  must be defined , comprising an explicit call to the base-class <code>__init__</code>   </p></li>
</ul>

<p>.</p>

<p>What I feel astonishing in the post of Anon is not only that he expresses the contrary of the inheritance theory, but that there have been 5 guys passing by that upvoted without turning a hair, and moreover there have been nobody to react in 2 years in a thread whose interesting subject must be read relatively often.</p>
