<h3>Question (ID-117732):</h3><h2>Can you do LINQ-like queries in a language like Python or Boo?</h2><p>Take this simple C# LINQ query, and imagine that 'db.Numbers' is an SQL table with one column, Number:</p>

<p>var result = 
    from n in db.Numbers
        where n.Number &lt; 5
        select n.Number;</p>

<p>This will run very efficiently in C#, because it generates an SQL query something like "select Number from Numbers where Number &lt; 5".  What it <em>doesn't</em> do is select <em>all</em> the numbers from the database, and then filter them in C#, as it might appear to do at first.</p>

<p>Python supports a similar syntax:</p>

<p>result = [n.Number for n in Numbers if n.Number &lt; 5]</p>

<p>But it the "if" clause here does the filtering on the client side, rather than the server side, which is much less efficient.</p>

<p>Is there something as efficient as LINQ in Python?  (I'm currently evaluating Python vs. IronPython vs. Boo, so an answer that works in any of those languages is fine.)</p>

<p>It should be something like...</p>

<pre><code>result = [n.Number for n in db.Numbers.filter(db.Numbers.Number &lt; 5).all()]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>LINQ is a language feature of C# and VB.NET.  It is a special syntax recognized by the compiler and treated specially.  It is also dependent on another language feature called expression trees.</p>

<p>Expression trees are a <strong>little</strong> different in that they are not special syntax.  They are written just like any other class instantiation, but the compiler does treat them specially under the covers by turning a lambda into an instantiation of a run-time <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">abstract syntax tree</a>.  These can be manipulated at run-time to produce a command in another language (i.e. SQL).</p>

<p>The C# and VB.NET compilers take LINQ syntax, and turn it into lambdas, then pass those into expression tree instantiations.  Then there are a bunch of framework classes that manipulate these trees to produce SQL.  You can also find other libraries, both MS-produced and third party, that offer "LINQ providers", which basically pop a different AST processer in to produce something from the LINQ other than SQL.</p>

<p>So one obstacle to doing these things in another language is the question whether they support run-time AST building/manipulation.  I don't know whether any implementations of Python or Boo do, but I haven't heard of any such features.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Look closely at <a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/" rel="nofollow">SQLAlchemy</a>.  This can probably do much of what you want.  It gives you Python syntax for plain-old SQL that runs on the server.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I believe that when IronPython 2.0 is complete, it will have LINQ support (see <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/ironpy/browse_thread/thread/eb6b9eb2241cc68e" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> for some example discussion).  Right now you should be able to write something like:</p>

<pre><code>Queryable.Select(Queryable.Where(someInputSequence, somePredicate), someFuncThatReturnsTheSequenceElement)
</code></pre>

<p>Something better might have made it into IronPython 2.0b4 - there's a lot of <a href="http://ironpython-urls.blogspot.com/2008/09/dlr-namespace-change-fire-drill.html" rel="nofollow">current discussion</a> about how naming conflicts were handled.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>A key factor for LINQ is the ability of the compiler to generate expression trees.
I am using a macro in Nemerle that converts a given Nemerle expression into an Expression tree object.
I can then pass this to the Where/Select/etc extension methods on IQueryables.
It's not quite the syntax of C# and VB, but it's close enough for me. </p>

<p>I got the Nemerle macro via a link on this post:

<p>It should be possible to create a similar macro for Boo. It's quite a bit of work however, given the large set of possible expressions you need to support.
Ayende has given a proof of concept here:

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Boo supports list generator expressions using the same syntax as python.  For more information on that, check out the Boo documentation on <a href="http://boo.codehaus.org/Generator+Expressions" rel="nofollow">Generator expressions</a> and <a href="http://boo.codehaus.org/List+Generators" rel="nofollow">List comprehensions</a>.</p>
