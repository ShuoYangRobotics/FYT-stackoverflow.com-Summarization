<h3>Question (ID-1125637):</h3><h2>Running Python code from a server?</h2><p><strong>Problem:</strong> to run one.py from a server.</p>

<p><strong>Error</strong></p>

<p>When I try to do it in Mac, I get errors:</p>

<pre><code>$python http://cs.edu.com/u/user/TEST/one.py                       ~ 
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/Resources/Python.app/Contents/MacOS/Python: can't open file 'http://cs.edu.com/u/user/TEST/one.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
</code></pre>

<p>one.py is like:</p>

<pre><code>print 1
</code></pre>

<p>When I do it in Ubuntu, I get "file is not found".</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong>  How can I run Python code from a server?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>So far as I know, the standard Python shell doesn't know how to execute remote scripts. Try using <code>curl</code> or <code>wget</code> to retrieve the script and run it from the local copy.</p>

<pre><code>$ wget http://cs.edu.com/u/user/TEST/one.py
$ python one.py
</code></pre>

<p>UPDATE: Based on the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1122609/javascript-for-a-form-on-the-server-side">question</a> referenced in the comment to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1125637/running-python-code-from-a-server/1125670#1125670">this answer</a>, you need to execute <code>one.py</code> based on incoming HTTP requests from end users. The simplest solution is probably <a href="http://www.garshol.priv.no/download/text/http-tut.html" rel="nofollow">CGI</a>, but depending on what else you need to do, a more robust solution might involve a <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/WebFrameworks" rel="nofollow">framework</a> of some sort. They each have there strengths and weaknesses, so you should probably consider your requirements carefully before jumping in.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You can't do this. If you have SSH access to the server you can then run the python script located on the server using your SSH connection. If you want to write websites in python google python web frameworks for examples of how to set up and run websites with Python.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><pre><code>wget http://cs.edu.com/u/user/TEST/one.py
python one.py
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You can mount the remote servers directory with some sort of file networking, like NFS or something. That way it becomes local.</p>

<p>But a better idea is that you explain why you are trying to do this, so we can solve the real usecase. There is most likely tons of better solutions, depending on what the real problem is.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>The python interpreter doesn't know how to read from a URL.  The file needs to be local.  </p>

<p>However, if you are trying to get the <em>server</em> to execute the python code, you can use <a href="http://www.modpython.org/" rel="nofollow">mod_python</a> or various kinds of CGI.  </p>

<p>You can't do what you are trying to do the way you are trying to do it.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Maybe something like this?</p>

<pre><code>python -c "import urllib; eval(urllib.urlopen(\"http://cs.edu.com/u/user/TEST/one.py").read())"
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>OK, now when you explained, here is a new answer.</p>

<p>You run that script with </p>

<pre><code> python one.py
</code></pre>

<p>It's a server side-script. It's run on the server. It's also located on the server. Why you try to access it via http is beyond me. Run it from the file system.</p>

<p>Although, you should probably look into running Grok or Django or something. This way you'll just end up writing your own Python web framework, you may just as well use one that exists instead. ;)</p>
