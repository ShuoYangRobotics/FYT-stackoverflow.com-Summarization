<h3>Question (ID-2537726):</h3><h2>Using urllib2 with SOCKS proxy</h2><p>Is it possible to fetch pages with urllib2 through a SOCKS proxy on a one socks server per opener basic? I've seen the solution using setdefaultproxy method, but I need to have different socks in different openers.</p>

<p>So there is SocksiPy library, which works great, but it has to be used this way:</p>

<pre><code>import socks
import socket
socket.socket = socks.socksocket
import urllib2
socks.setdefaultproxy(socks.PROXY_TYPE_SOCKS5, "x.x.x.x", y)
</code></pre>

<p>That is, it sets the same proxy for ALL urllib2 requests. How can I have different proxies for different openers?</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Yes, you can. I repeat my answer on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/8100870/88231">How can I use a SOCKS 4/5 proxy with urllib2?</a>
You need to create an opener for every proxy like you do with an http proxy. The code for adding this feature to SocksiPy is available in GitHub <a href="https://gist.github.com/869791" rel="nofollow">https://gist.github.com/869791</a> and is as simple as:</p>

<pre><code>opener = urllib2.build_opener(SocksiPyHandler(socks.PROXY_TYPE_SOCKS4, 'localhost', 9999))
print opener.open('http://www.whatismyip.com/automation/n09230945.asp').read()
</code></pre>

<p>For more information I've written an example running multiple Tor instances to behave like a rotating proxy: <a href="http://blog.databigbang.com/distributed-scraping-with-multiple-tor-circuits/" rel="nofollow">Distributed Scraping With Multiple Tor Circuits</a></p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You might be able to use threading locks if there aren't too many connections being made at once, and you need to access from multiple threads:</p>

<pre><code>import socks
import socket
import thread
lock = thread.allocate_lock()
socket.socket = socks.socksocket

def GetConn():
    lock.acquire()
    import urllib2
    socks.setdefaultproxy(socks.PROXY_TYPE_SOCKS5, "x.x.x.x", y)
    conn = urllib2.urlopen(ARGUMENTS HERE)
    lock.release()
    return conn
</code></pre>

<p>You might also be able to use something like this every time you need to get a connection:</p>

<pre><code>urllib2 = execfile('urllib2.py')
urllib2.socket = dummy_class() # dummy_class needs the socket module's methods
</code></pre>

<p>These are obviously not fantastic solutions, but I've put in my 2Â¢ anyway :-)</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p><strong>== EDIT == (old HTTP-Proxy example was here..)</strong></p>

<p>My fault.. urllib2 has no builtin support for SOCKS proxying.. </p>

<p>There are some '<em>hacks</em>' adding SOCKS to urllib2 (or the socket object in general) <a href="http://bytes.com/topic/python/answers/478365-i-wanna-use-urllib2-get-page-socks-5-proxy-who-can-give-me-sample-code#post1848118" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br>
But I hardly suspect that this will work with multiple proxies like you require it.  </p>

<p>As long as you don't wan't to hook / subclass urllib2.ProxyHandler I would suggest to go with pycurl.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You have only one socket for all openers and implementing socks is in socket level. So, you can't.<br>
I suggest you to use pycurl library, it much more flexible.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>A cumbersome but working solution for using a SOCKS proxy is to set up provixy with proxy chaining and then set the HTTP_PROXY provided by privoxy via system variable or any other way.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>You could do you it by setting evironmental variable HTTP_PROXY in following format:</p>

<p>user:pass@proxy:port</p>

<p>or if you use bat/cmd, add before calling script:</p>

<p>set HTTP_PROXY=user:pass@proxy:port</p>

<p>I am using such cmd-file to make easy_install work under proxy.</p>
