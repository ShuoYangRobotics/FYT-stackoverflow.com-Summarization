<h3>Question (ID-517237):</h3><h2>HOWTO: Write Python API wrapper?</h2><p>I'd like to write a python library to wrap a REST-style API offered by a particular Web service. Does anyone know of any good learning resources for such work, preferably aimed at intermediate Python programmers?</p>

<p>I'd like a good article on the subject, but I'd settle for nice, clear code examples.</p>

<p><strong>CLARIFICATION:</strong> What I'm looking to do is write a Python client to interact with a Web service -- something to construct HTTP requests and parse XML/JSON responses, all wrapped up in Python objects.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I can't point you to any article on how to do it, but I think there are a few libraries that can be good models on how to design your own.</p>

<p><a href="http://pyaws.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">PyAws</a> for example. I didn't see the source code so I can't tell you how good it is as code example, but the features and the usage examples in their website should be a useful design model</p>

<p><a href="http://www.feedparser.org/" rel="nofollow">Universal Feed Parser</a> is not a wrapper for a webservice (it's an RSS parser library), but it's a great example of a design that prioritizes usage flexibility and hiding implementation details. I think you can get very good usage ideas for your wrapper there.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>My favorite combination is httplib2 (or pycurl for performance) and simplejson. As REST is more "a way of design" then a real "protocol" there is not really a reusable thing (that I know of). On Ruby you have something like ActiveResource. And to be honest, even that would just expose some tables as a webservice, whereas the power of xml/json is that they are more like "views" that can contain multiple objects optimized for your application. I hope this makes sense :-)</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><a href="http://learn-rest.blogspot.com/2008/02/using-rest-in-python.html" rel="nofollow">This tutorial page</a> could be a good starting place (but it doesn't contain everything you need).</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You should take a look at PyFacebook.  This is a python wrapper for the Facebook API, and it's one of the most nicely done API's I have ever used.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>It would help to know about the service API you want to interface with. You say "REST-style" but that can mean many things these days, since almost no one actually means REST when they say it. The way you'd consume a real REST API is very different from the much more common RPC APIs.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You could checkout <a href="http://github.com/ryanmcgrath/pythentic_jobs" rel="nofollow">pythenic jobs</a>, a nice, simple, but well-formed "Python wrapper around the Authentic Jobs ... API" as a good example. That's what I'm doing now :)</p>
