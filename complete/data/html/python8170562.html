<h3>Question (ID-8170562):</h3><h2>Python: reduce on tuple of tuples</h2><p>I am trying to compute in Python the length of the path from a point A to a point B going through a list of intermediary points. <strong>I know how to do it but I do want to use the reduce Built-in function</strong>.</p>

<p>Why I tried so far, <strong>please note that it is completely wrong</strong>, is this:</p>

<pre><code>reduce(lambda x,y: math.sqrt((y[1]-y[0])**2+(x[1]-x[0])**2) , ((1,2),(3,4),(1,8)))
</code></pre>

<p>Any idea?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You should map before you reduce.</p>

<pre><code>points = [(1, 2), (3, 4), (1, 8)]
distances = (math.hypot(b[0]-a[0], b[1]-a[1])
             for a, b in zip(points, points[1:]))
total_distance = sum(distances)
</code></pre>

<p>or, if you <em>must</em> use <code>reduce()</code>, although <code>sum()</code> is better for this purpose:</p>

<pre><code>import operator

total_distance = reduce(operator.add, distances)
</code></pre>

<p>If you have a lot of points, you might find NumPy helpful in doing this all at once, quickly:</p>

<pre><code>import numpy

total_distance = numpy.hypot(*numpy.diff(numpy.array(points), axis=0)).sum()
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: use <code>math.hypot()</code> and add NumPy method.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>It isn't pretty but it can be done :-)</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; tot = ((1,2),(3,4),(1,8))
&gt;&gt;&gt; reduce(lambda d,((x0,y0),(x1,y1)): d + ((x1-x0)**2+(y1-y0)**2)**0.5, zip(tot[1:], tot[0:]), 0.0)
7.3005630797457695
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><code>reduce()</code> is simply the wrong tool for this purpose.  It <em>is</em> possible to do it with <code>reduce()</code>, but it is a bit weird:</p>

<pre><code>def distance((x, d), y):
    return y, d + math.hypot(y[0] - x[0], y[1] - x[1])

print reduce(distance, [(3,4),(1,8)], ((1, 2), 0.0))[1]
</code></pre>

<p>prints</p>

<pre><code>7.30056307975
</code></pre>

<p>The last parameter passed to the <code>reduce()</code> call is the starting point and the initial value for the distance.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>reduce does not work that way, you start with an initial value a, which you specify or is taken as first element from your iterable. afterwards, you pass a,next_element to the function (lambda) provided and store the result in a, repeat until all elements are iterated.</p>

<p>You can do what you want with sum and map by first calculating all distances from one point to the next and then summing them:</p>

<pre><code>path = [(1,2),(3,4),(1,8)]
sum(map(lambda x,y: math.sqrt((x[0]-y[0])**2+(x[1]-y[1])**2), path[:-1],path[1:]))
</code></pre>

<p>edit: or with the <code>hypot</code> function (thx @ralu):</p>

<pre><code>sum(map(lambda x,y: math.hypot(x[0]-y[0],x[1]-y[1]), path[:-1],path[1:]))
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Here is a <code>redux</code> meta-iterator that can be combined with the built-in <code>reduce</code> to get the result you want.  This implementation avoids all buffering of the input sequence.</p>

<pre><code>def redux(f):
  def execute(iterable):
    iterable = iter(iterable)
    try:
      state = iterable.next()
    except StopIteration:
      raise ValueError, 'empty sequences not supported'
    while True:
      newstate = iterable.next()
      yield f(state, newstate)
      state = newstate
  return execute

f = redux(lambda x, y: math.sqrt((y[0] - x[0])**2 + (y[1] - x[1])**2))
print reduce(operator.add, f(((1,2),(3,4),(1,8))))
</code></pre>

<p>The above prints <code>7.30056307975</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>redux</code> function can be generalized to support more than two arguments at a time in a sliding window, by using <code>inspect.getargspec</code> to count the number of arguments required by its function argument.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>This is just not the sort of code you want to write.
Reduce won't be a good solution.</p>

<p>I suggest a iterative one.
It will be the most readable, pythonic and maintainable solution.</p>

<pre><code>import math
path = [(1,2),(3,4),(1,8)]

def calc_dist(waypoints):
    dist = 0.0
    for i in range(len(waypoints) - 1):
        a = waypoints[i]
        b = waypoints[i+1]
        dist += math.hypot(a[0]-b[0], b[1]-a[1])
    return dist

print calc_dist( path )
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I'm aware that what I'm about to suggest is not ideal, but I think this is as close as I can get for my contribution. This is a fun problem to solve, even if it isn't the most traditional application of reduce.</p>

<p>The key issue seems to be keeping track of the distance from point to point without overwriting the points themselves- adding another 'dimension' to each point gives you a field with which you can track the running distance.</p>

<pre><code>iterable = ((1,2,0), (3,4,0), (1,8,0))
# originally ((1,2), (3,4), (1,8))

from math import sqrt

def func(tup1, tup2):
    '''function to pass to reduce'''

    # extract coordinates
    x0 = tup1[0]
    x1 = tup2[0]
    y0 = tup1[1]
    y1 = tup2[1]

    dist = tup1[2] # retrieve running total for distance

    dx = x1 - x0   # find change in x
    dy = y1 - y0   # find change in y

    # add new distance to running total
    dist += sqrt(dx**2 + dy**2) 

    # return 2nd point with the updated distance
    return tup2[:-1] + (dist,)  # e.g. (3, 4, 2.828)
</code></pre>

<p>Now reduce:</p>

<pre><code>reduce(func, iterable)[-1]
# returns 7.3005630797457695
</code></pre>

<p>This way, the intermediate tuple of tuples (i.e., after one 'reduction') becomes:</p>

<pre><code>((3, 4, 2.8284271247461903), (1,8,0))
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Just for fun, here is an alternate solution with a slightly different approach than the <code>reduce(sum, map(hypot, zip(...)))</code> approach.</p>

<pre><code>tot = ((1,2),(3,4),(1,8))
reduce(lambda (d,(x,y)),b: (d+math.hypot(x-b[0],y-b[1]), b), tot, (0, tot[0]))[0]
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the <code>reduce</code> actually returns the tuple (distance, last point), hence the <code>[0]</code> at the end.  I <em>think</em> this would be more efficient than <code>zip</code> solutions but haven't actually checked.</p>
