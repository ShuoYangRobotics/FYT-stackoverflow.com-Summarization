<h3>Question (ID-1001851):</h3><h2>PYTHONPATH ignored</h2><p>Environment: debian 4.0</p>

<p>Python 2.4</p>

<p>My 'project' is installed in:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/project. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I want to use my working copy instead of the installed one which is located in:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>/home/me/dev/project/src</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what I do is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>export PYTHONPATH=/home/me/dev/project/src</p>
  
  <p>ipython</p>
  
  <p>import foo # which is in src</p>
  
  <p><code>foo.__file__</code></p>

<pre><code>*/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/project/foo.py*
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>instead of :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>/home/me/dev/project/src/project/foo.py</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How come? I try to check the pathes (having done the export above) and what I see is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>import sys,os</p>
  
  <p>sys.path</p>
  
  <p><em>['',
   '/usr/bin',
   '/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages',
   '/home/me/dev/project/src',
   '/usr/lib/python24.zip',
   '/usr/lib/python2.4',
   '/usr/lib/python2.4/plat-linux2',
   '/usr/lib/python2.4/lib-tk',
   '/usr/lib/python2.4/lib-dynload',
   '/usr/local/lib/python2.4/site-packages',
   '/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/PIL',
   '/var/lib/python-support/python2.4',
   '/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/IPython/Extensions',
   '/home/me/.ipython']</em></p>
  
  <p>os.environ['PYTHONPATH']</p>
  
  <p><em>/home/me/dev/project/src</em></p>

<p>Under python-2.6 it is different: <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/modules.html#the-module-search-path" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/tutorial/modules.html#the-module-search-path</a></p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I found the problem (I've missed early on when somebody pointed me to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/897792/pythons-sys-path-value">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/897792/pythons-sys-path-value</a>).</p>

<p>It seems that easy_install creates a pth file /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/easy-install.pth which is then loaded by site.py. This inserts the site-packages path in the sys path before the PYTHONPATH. Not nice.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I see '/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages' in your path prior to '/home/me/dev/project/src', does that matter?  What happens when you switch the two?</p>

<p>From the docs:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When PYTHONPATH is not set, or when the file is not found there, the search continues in an installation-dependent default path</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So perhaps you didn't find your working copy on your PYTHONPATH as you had thought?</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I think you set up PYTHONPATH to /home/me/build/project/src since /home/me/dev/project/src does not appear in sys.path, but /home/me/build/project/src does.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I don't believe you have any control over where the PYTHONPATH gets inserted into the actual path list.  But that's not the only way to modify the path - you can update sys.path yourself, before you try to import the project.</p>

<p><b>Edit:</b> In your specific case, you can modify the path with</p>

<pre><code>import sys
sys.path.insert(2, '/home/me/dev/project/src')
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>It sounds like the <code>src</code> directory doesn't have an <code>__init__.py</code> file.  It's not a proper package.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Not a direct answer to you question, but you could also use a <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv" rel="nofollow" title="virtualenv">virtualenv</a> to create a development environment. In that virtualenv you can then install your product in /home/me/dev/project/src as a development package: "python setup.py develop".</p>

<p>This way you don't have to change your PYTHONPATH manually. Just activate the virtualenv if you want to use the development code.</p>
