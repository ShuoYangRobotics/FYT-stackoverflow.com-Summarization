<h3>Question (ID-2361426):</h3><h2>What is the best way to get the first item from an iterable matching a condition?</h2><p>In Python, I would like to get the first item from a list matching a condition. For example, the following function is adequate:</p>

<pre><code>def first(the_iterable, condition = lambda x: True):
    for i in the_iterable:
        if condition(i):
            return i
</code></pre>

<p>This function could be used something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; first(range(10))
0
&gt;&gt;&gt; first(range(10), lambda i: i &gt; 3)
4
</code></pre>

<p>However, I can't think of a good built-in / one-liner to let me do this (and I don't particularly want to copy this function around if I don't have to). Any ideas?</p>

<p>(It's important that the resulting method not process the entire list, which could be quite large.)</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Similar to using <code>ifilter</code>, you could use a generator expression:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; (x for x in xrange(10) if x &gt; 5).next()
6
</code></pre>

<p>In either case, you probably want to catch <code>StopIteration</code> though, in case no elements satisfy your condition.</p>

<p>Technically speaking, I suppose you could do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; foo = None
&gt;&gt;&gt; for foo in (x for x in xrange(10) if x &gt; 5): break
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo
6
</code></pre>

<p>It would avoid having to make a <code>try/except</code> block. But that seems kind of obscure and abusive to the syntax.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>In Python 2.6 or better, <code>next(x for x in the_iterable if x &gt; 3)</code>, assuming you want <code>None</code> if no item in the iterale satisfies the condition (if you want a different default result in that case, you can pass it to <code>next</code> as a second argument, but you'll need an extra pair of parentheses around the generator expression).</p>

<p>I see most answers resolutely ignore the <code>next</code> built-in and so I assume that for some mysterious reason they're 100% focused on versions 2.5 and older -- without mentioning the Python-version issue (but then I don't see that mention in the answers that <em>do</em> mention the <code>next</code> built-in, which is why I thought it necessary to provide an answer myself -- at least the "correct version" issue gets on record this way;-).</p>

<p>In 2.5, the <code>.next()</code> method of iterators immediately raises <code>StopIteration</code> if the iterator immediately finishes -- i.e., for your use case, if no item in the iterable satisfies the condition.  If you don't care (i.e., you know there <strong>must</strong> be at least one satisfactory item) then just use <code>.next()</code> (best on a genexp, line for the <code>next</code> built-in in Python 2.6 and better).</p>

<p>If you <em>do</em> care, wrapping things in a function as you had first indicated in your Q seems best, and while the function implementation you proposed is just fine, you could alternatively use <code>itertools</code>, a <code>for...: break</code> loop, or a genexp, or a <code>try/except StopIteration</code> as the function's body, as various answers suggested.  There's not much added value in any of these alternatives so I'd go for the starkly-simple version you first proposed.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>The <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/itertools.html" rel="nofollow"><code>itertools</code></a> module contains a filter function for iterators. The first element of the filtered iterator can be obtained by calling <code>next()</code> on it:</p>

<pre><code>from itertools import ifilter

print ifilter((lambda i: i &gt; 3), range(10)).next()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I would write this </p>

<pre><code>next(x for x in xrange(10) if i &gt; 3)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>For older versions of Python where the next built-in doesn't exist:</p>

<pre><code>(x for x in range(10) if x &gt; 3).next()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Oneliner:</p>

<pre><code>thefirst = [i for i in range(10) if i &gt; 3][0]
</code></pre>

<p>If youre not sure that any element will be valid according to the criteria, you should enclose this with <code>try/except</code> since that <code>[0]</code> can raise an <code>IndexError</code>.</p>
