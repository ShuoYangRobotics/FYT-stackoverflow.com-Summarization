<h3>Question (ID-7937042):</h3><h2>How to remove the row that has special characters in it</h2><p>I have a large text file that has a lot of special characters in it like "$!@%#$/" plus many more and I would like to remove the line in the text file if it has any special characters in that line. The only characters I want to keep is a-z and A-Z. </p>

<p>If this was the file...</p>

<pre><code>!Somejunk)(^%
)%(&amp;_
this
my_file
is
*(%%$
the
they're
file
</code></pre>

<p>Then the only thing that would be left would be...</p>

<pre><code>this
is
the
file
</code></pre>

<p>A solution with linux command line tools, or a bash script, or a python script would be better, but anything that works will do!</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>This seems to work:</p>

<pre><code> sed '/[^[:alpha:]]/d' source_file
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If you want to keep ONLY lines with alpha characters (as the OP requested), then:</p>

<pre><code>$ grep -v '[^a-zA-Z]' foo
</code></pre>

<p>Or if you only want <em>English</em> characters:</p>

<pre><code>$ grep -v '[^abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ]' foo
</code></pre>

<p>But if you just want to remove non-alpha characters, <code>sed</code> will do the job:</p>

<pre><code>$ cat foo | sed 's/[^a-zA-Z]//g'
</code></pre>

<p>Or if you just want to kill <em>binary</em>, non-printable data, use strings:</p>

<pre><code>$ strings foo
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p><code>grep -v</code> and some regex?</p>

<p>say,
<code>egrep -v '[^a-zA-Z]'</code></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You can use the following command to filter out the required lines:</p>

<p>grep '^[A-Za-z ]\+$' <em>file</em></p>

<p>If you don't even allow spaces in rows, you may omit out space after <em>z</em>.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>or like this completely in bash</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

file=$(cat file.txt);

for line in $file; do
    if [[ $line =~ ^[a-zA-Z]+$ ]]; then
        echo $line
    fi
done
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I'm going to take the really nooby approach.</p>

<pre><code>x = open('file','r')
y = x.read().split('\n')
x.close()

for z in range (0, len(y)):
    for a in range (0, len(y[z])):
        if not y[z][a].isalpha() and not y[z][a].isdigit():
            y[z][a] = ''

OutputString = '\n'.join(y)
</code></pre>
