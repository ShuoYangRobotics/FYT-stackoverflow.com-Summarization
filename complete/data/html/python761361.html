<h3>Question (ID-761361):</h3><h2>Suppress the u'prefix indicating unicode' in python strings</h2><p>Is there a way to globally suppress the unicode string indicator in python?  I'm working exclusively with unicode in an application, and do a lot of interactive stuff.  Having the u'prefix' show up in all of my debug output is unnecessary and obnoxious.  Can it be turned off?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You could use Python 3.0.. The default string type is unicode, so the <code>u''</code> prefix is no longer required..</p>

<p>In short, no. You cannot turn this off.</p>

<p>The <code>u</code> comes from the <code>unicode.__repr__</code> method, which is used to display stuff in REPL:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print repr(unicode('a'))
u'a'
&gt;&gt;&gt; unicode('a')
u'a'
</code></pre>

<p>If I'm not mistaken, you cannot override this without recompiling Python.</p>

<p>The simplest way around this is to simply print the string..</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print unicode('a')
a
</code></pre>

<p>If you use the <code>unicode()</code> builtin to construct all your strings, you could do something like..</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class unicode(unicode):
...     def __repr__(self):
...             return str(self)
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; unicode('a')
a
</code></pre>

<p>..but don't do that, it's horrible</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>using <code>str( text )</code> is a somewhat bad idea in fact whenever you cannot be 100% sure about both your python's default encoding and the exact content of the string---the latter would be typical for a text fetched from the internet. also, depending on what you want to do, using <code>print text.encode( 'utf-8' )</code> or <code>print repr( text.encode( 'utf-8' ) )</code> may yield disappointing results, as you might get a rendering full of unreadable codepoints like <code>\x3a</code>.</p>

<p>i think the optimum is really to avail yourself of a unicode-capable command line (difficult under windows, easy under linux) and switch from python 2.x to python 3.x. the ease and clarity of text vs bytes handling afforded by the new python 3 series is really one of the big gains you can expect. it does mean you'll have to spend a little time learning the distinction between 'bytes' and 'text' and grasp the concept of character encodings, but then that time is much better spent in a python 3 environment as python's new approch to these vexing problems is much clearer and much less error-prone than what python 2 had to offer. i'd go so far as to call python 2's approach to unicode problematic in retrospect, although i used to think of it as superior---when i compared it to the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.utf8-encode.php" rel="nofollow">way this issue is handled in php</a>.</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong> i just stopped by <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/571694/what-factors-make-php-unicode-incompatible">a related discussion</a> here on SO and found this comment on the way that php these days appears to tackle unicode / encoding issues:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It's like a mouse trying to eat an
  elephant. By framing Unicode as an
  extension of ASCII (we have normal
  strings and we have mb_strings) it
  gets things the wrong way around, and
  gets hung up on what special cases are
  required to deal with characters with
  funny squiggles that need more than
  one byte. If you treat Unicode as
  providing an abstract space for any
  character you need, ASCII is
  accommodated in that without any need
  to treat it as a special case.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>i quote this here because in my experience 90% of all SO python+unicode topics seem to come from people who used to be fine with ascii or maybe latin-1, got bitten by the occasional character that was not supported in their usual settings, and then basically just want to get rid of it. what you do when switching to python 3 is exactly what the commenter above suggests to do: instead of viewing unicode as a vexing extension of ascii, you start to view ascii (and almost any other encoding you'll ever meet) as subset(s) of unicode. </p>

<p>to be true, unicode v6 is certainly not the last word in encodings, but it is as close to being universal as you can get in 2011. get used to it.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Try the following</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>print str(result.url)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It could be that your default encoding has been changed.</p>

<p>You can check your default encoding with the following:-</p>

<pre><code>&gt; import sys
&gt; print sys.getdefaultencoding()
&gt; ascii
</code></pre>

<p>The default should be ascii which means u'string' should be printed as 'string' but yours may have been modified.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Not sure with unicode, but generally you can call <code>str.encode()</code> to convert it to a more suitable form. For instance, subprocess output captured in Python 3.0+ captures it as a byte stream (prefix 'b'), and encode() fixes to a regular string form.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Try this trick at the start of your program:</p>

<pre><code>import sys
reload(sys)
sys.setdefaultencoding("utf-8")
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I know this isn't a global option, but you can also suppress the Unicode u by placing the string in a str() function.</p>

<p>So a Unicode derived list that would look like:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; myList=[unicode('a'),unicode('b'),unicode('c')]
&gt;&gt;&gt; myList
[u'a', u'b', u'c']
</code></pre>

<p>would become this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; myList=[str(unicode('a')),str(unicode('b')),str(unicode('c'))]
&gt;&gt;&gt; myList
['a', 'b', 'c']
</code></pre>

<p>It's a bit cumbersome, but might be useful to some one</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>You have to use <code>print str(your_Variable)</code></p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>In the case that you do not want to update to Python 3, you could make use of substrings.
For example, say the original output was (u'mystring',). Let us assume for the sake of the example that the variable row contains the "mystring" string without the unicode prefix. Then you would want to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>temp = str(row); #str is not necessary, but probably good practice
temp = temp[:-3];
print = temp[3:];
</code></pre>
