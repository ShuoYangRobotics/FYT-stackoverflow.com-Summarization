<h3>Question (ID-23397):</h3><h2>What's the best way to duplicate fork() in windows?</h2><p>How do I implement some logic that will allow me to duplicate the functionality on windows that I have on linux with fork() using python?</p>

<p>I'm specifically trying to execute a method on the SAPI Com component, while continuing the other logic in the main thread without blocking or waiting.</p>

  <p>The fork call in Cygwin is particularly interesting because it does not map well on top of the Win32 API. This makes it very difficult to implement correctly.</p>

<p>See the <a href="http://www.redhat.com/support/wpapers/cygnus/cygnus_cygwin/architecture.html">The Cygwin Architecture</a>, section 5.6. "Process Creation" for a description of this hack.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Have a look at the process management functions in the <a href="http://python.org/doc/2.5/lib/os-process.html" rel="nofollow">os module</a>. There are function for starting new processes in many different ways, both synchronously and asynchronously.</p>

<p>I should note also that Windows doesn't provide functionality that is exactly like fork() on other systems. To do multiprocessing on Windows, you will need to use the <a href="http://python.org/doc/2.5/lib/module-threading.html" rel="nofollow">threading</a> module.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Use the python <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html" rel="nofollow">multiprocessing module</a> which will work everywhere.</p>

<p>Here is a <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-multiprocessing/" rel="nofollow">IBM developerWords article</a> that shows how to convert from os.fork() to the multiprocessing module.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>In addition to the process management code in the os module that Greg pointed out, you should also take a look at the threading module: <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-threading.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/lib/module-threading.html</a></p>

<pre><code>from threading import Thread

def separate_computations(x, y):
    print sum(x for i in range(y))  # really expensive multiplication

Thread(target=separate_compuations, args=[57, 83]).start()
print "I'm continuing while that other function runs in another thread!"
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You might also like using the processing module (<a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/processing" rel="nofollow">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/processing</a>). It has lot's of functionality for writing parallel systems with the same API as the threading module...</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>The Threading example from Eli will run the thread, but not do any of the work after that line.  </p>

<p>I'm going to look into the processing module and the subprocess module.  I think the com method I'm running needs to be in another process, not just in another thread.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Possibly a version of spawn() for python? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spawn_(operating_system)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spawn_(operating_system)</a></p>
