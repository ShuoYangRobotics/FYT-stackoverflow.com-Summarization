<h3>Question (ID-3951613):</h3><h2>Learning Python Exercise</h2><p>I have taken it upon myself to learn python. As it is my second language is has not been that hard to get the hang of. I am looking for some simple python projects to undertake so I can better learn the syntax of the language in general. I would specifically like to learn the syntax of arrays, lists, and dictionaries.</p>

<p>Edit:
I cant say that one of your answers are right or wrong but between all of you i have alot of material! Thanks everyone :D</p>

<p>ps I particularly liked <a href="http://code.google.com/edu/languages/google-python-class/" rel="nofollow" title="Google Python Class">Google's Python Class</a></p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.pythonchallenge.com/" rel="nofollow">The Python Challenge</a> has been by <em>far</em> the coolest exploratory stuff I've done with Python.</p>

<p>Take your time working through the problems - it's worth it.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><a href="http://bitbucket.org/gregmalcolm/python_koans/wiki/Home" rel="nofollow">Python Koans</a> is a good interactive tutorial that covers basic syntax and advanced concepts.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I would highly recommend the following e-book for learning Python. It covers several different programming paradigms and is a very good introduction to Python in general.</p>

<p>If you are already familiar with programming in general then <a href="http://diveintopython.org/toc/index.html" rel="nofollow">Dive into Python</a> is an unbeatable resource for getting the foundation of the language fast.</p>

<p>I have read both of the above and found them to be very helpful.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You can try <a href="http://pyschools.com" rel="nofollow">pyschools.com</a>
There are many small exercises categorized into different topics. Quite a fun way to learn how to program. </p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Sorry to state the obvious, but why not read a good book or two, like:</p>

<p><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0596158068" rel="nofollow">Learning Python: Powerful Object-Oriented Programming</a></p>

<p>If you like more of a learn as you go approach, there's always the venerable:</p>

<p><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0596007973" rel="nofollow">Python Cookbook</a></p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Steve Lott's <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/s_lott/books/python.html" rel="nofollow">Building Skills In Python</a> is great.  He's prominent on this site, too.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Also in line with the Project Euler answer already provided, I'd recommend looking into some Code Kata.  I generally go through these as part of learning any new language, and here's a link to several good ones:</p>

<p>Also a Stack Overflow question discussing Kata:</p>

<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>A usual response to such things is <a href="http://projecteuler.net" rel="nofollow">Project Euler</a>. Not necessarily special to python, but all those problems are solveable with python, and by working on them, you especially learn a lot of things that make Python special.</p>
