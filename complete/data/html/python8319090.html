<h3>Question (ID-8319090):</h3><h2>developer tools used in programming</h2><p>I am a pretty recent developer..
but I have a single monitor (big enough) but it is so annoying that every now and then I first use the text editor to write the code and then go to terminal to execute and debug
I was wondering if there is any developer tools where I can like use half screen for that note pad and the other half for terminal.. so that I dont have to shuffle back and forth between the terminal and the text-editor...
Something like, when this software is running... then notepad and terminal just freezes in that half screen and when i close this software I can minimize and turn to normal mode.
If not it would be cool thing to have. :D
THanks</p>

<p>That's for the easy and money-based way. More complex ways - you can use a text editor that allows running your scripts, upload to webservers, whatnot. It pretty much depends on the stuff you're developing.</p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Use <em>ViM</em> in split window mode, edit your script on the left side and start ConqueTerm (use <em>:ConqueTerm bash</em>) on the right side. Now you can code and execute Python code in the same terminal window at the same time using a superior text editor ;-)</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer: Of course this only helps if you are familiar with ViM already.</em></p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>There are many editors... and IDE's that will allow you to run your code from directly within the editor / IDE enviroment</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question, but it seems like the easiest way is to simply manually resize the windows and place them where you want them. Also, a handy tool in general is the Python IDLE, where you can code in the Python window and simply have it run in the shell by pressing F5.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p><strong>When you say "terminal" do you mean a python console or a real system terminal?</strong></p>

<p>If it is the first case, then most if not all python IDE I have ever used do have that functionality built in: gedit, eclipse, geany, SPE, just to mention a few.</p>

<p>If it is the second case, some IDE like gedit do have a plugin for that, but in general what you should probably use is another <em>window manager</em> (namely a <em>tiling</em> window manager). No idea on how the situation looks like on Microsoft / Apple OS's, but under GNU/Linux you have a plethora of different tiled window managers. Two that I tried and liked are <a href="http://xmonad.org/" rel="nofollow">Xmonad</a> and <a href="http://awesome.naquadah.org/" rel="nofollow">Awesome</a>.</p>

<p>HTH!</p>
