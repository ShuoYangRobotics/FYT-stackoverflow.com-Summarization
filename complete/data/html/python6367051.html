<h3>Question (ID-6367051):</h3><h2>Is there an easy way to tell which line number a file pointer is on?</h2><p>In Python 2.5, I am reading a structured text data file (~30 MB in size) using a file pointer:</p>

<pre><code>fp = open('myfile.txt', 'r')
line = fp.readline()
# ... many other fp.readline() processing steps, which
# are used in different contexts to read the structures
</code></pre>

<p>But then, while parsing the file, I hit something interesting that I want to report the line number of, so I can investigate the file in a text editor. I can use <code>fp.tell()</code> to tell me where the byte offset is (e.g. <code>16548974L</code>), but there is no "fp.tell_line_number()" to help me translate this to a line number.</p>

<p>Is there either a Python built-in or extension to easily track and "tell" what line number a text file pointer is on?</p>

<p>Note: I'm <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5944908/when-processing-a-file-how-do-i-obtain-the-current-line-number">not asking</a> to use a <code>line_number += 1</code> style counter, as I call <code>fp.readline()</code> in different contexts and that approach would require more debugging than it is worth to insert the counter in the right corners of the code.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>A typical solution to this problem is to define a new class that wraps an existing instance of a <code>file</code>, which automatically counts the numbers. Something like this (just off the top of my head, I haven't tested this):</p>

<pre><code>class FileLineWrapper(object):
    def __init__(self, f):
        self.f = f
        self.line = 0
    def close(self):
        return self.f.close()
    def readline(self):
        self.line += 1
        return self.f.readline()
</code></pre>

<p>Use it like this:</p>

<pre><code>f = FileLineWrapper(open("myfile.txt", "r"))
f.readline()
print(f.line)
</code></pre>

<p>It looks like the standard module <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/fileinput.html" rel="nofollow"><code>fileinput</code></a> does much the same thing (and some other things as well); you could use that instead if you like.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I'm not certain this has exactly what you need, but you might find the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/fileinput.html" rel="nofollow"><code>fileinput</code></a> module useful.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I don't think so, not in the way you desire (as in a standard built-in feature of Python file handles returned by <code>open</code>).</p>

<p>If you're not amenable to tracking the line number manually as you read the lines or the use of a wrapper class (excellent suggestions by GregH and senderle, by the way), then I think you'll have to simply use the <code>fp.tell()</code> figure and go back to the start of the file, reading until you get there.</p>

<p>That's not <em>too</em> bad an option since I'm assuming error conditions will be less likely than everything working swimmingly. If everything works okay, there's no impact.</p>

<p>If there's an error, then you have the extra effort of rescanning the file. If the file is <em>big,</em> that may impact your perceived performance - you should take that into account if it's a problem.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You could use a <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0318/" rel="nofollow">decorator</a> on readline function to count number of lines.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>One way might be to iterate over the line and keep an explicit count of the number of lines already seen:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; f=open('text.txt','r')
&gt;&gt;&gt; from itertools import izip
&gt;&gt;&gt; from itertools import count
&gt;&gt;&gt; f=open('test.java','r')
&gt;&gt;&gt; for line_no,line in izip(count(),f):
...     print line_no,line
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>The following code creates a function <strong>Which_Line_for_Position(pos)</strong> that gives the <strong>number of the line</strong> for the position <strong>pos</strong>, that is to say the <em>number of line</em> in which lies the character situated  at  position <em>pos</em> in the file.</p>

<p>This function can be used with any position as argument, independantly from the value of the file's  pointer's current position and from the historic of the movements of this pointer before the function is called.</p>

<p>So, with this function, one isn't limited to determine the number of the current line only during an uninterrupted iteration on the lines, as it is the case with Greg Hewgill's solution.</p>

<pre><code>with open(filepath,'rb') as f:
    GIVE_NO_FOR_END = {}
    end = 0
    for i,line in enumerate(f):
        end += len(line)
        GIVE_NO_FOR_END[end] = i
    if line[-1]=='\n':
        GIVE_NO_FOR_END[end+1] = i+1
    end_positions = GIVE_NO_FOR_END.keys()
    end_positions.sort()

def Which_Line_for_Position(pos,
                            dic = GIVE_NO_FOR_END,
                            keys = end_positions,
                            kmax = end_positions[-1]):
    return dic[(k for k in keys if pos &lt; k).next()] if pos&lt;kmax else None
</code></pre>

<p>.</p>

<p>The same solution can be written with the help of the module <strong>fileinput</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>import fileinput

GIVE_NO_FOR_END = {}
end = 0
for line in fileinput.input(filepath,'rb'):
    end += len(line)
    GIVE_NO_FOR_END[end] = fileinput.filelineno()
if line[-1]=='\n':
    GIVE_NO_FOR_END[end+1] = fileinput.filelineno()+1
fileinput.close()

end_positions = GIVE_NO_FOR_END.keys()
end_positions.sort()

def Which_Line_for_Position(pos,
                            dic = GIVE_NO_FOR_END,
                            keys = end_positions,
                            kmax = end_positions[-1]):
    return dic[(k for k in keys if pos &lt; k).next()] if pos&lt;kmax else None
</code></pre>

<p>But this solution has some inconveniences: </p>

<ul>
<li>it needs to import the module <strong>fileinput</strong></li>
<li>it deletes all the content of the file !! There must be something wrong in my code but I don't know <strong>fileinput</strong> enough to find it. Or is it a normal behaviour of <strong>fileinput.input()</strong> function ?</li>
<li>it seems that the file is first entirely read before any iteration can be launched. If so, for a file very big, the size of the file may exceed the capacity of the RAM. I am not sure of this point: I tried to test with a file of 1,5 GB but it's rather long and I dropped this point for the moment. If this point is right, it constitutes an argument to use the other solution with <strong>enumerate()</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Then, having function <strong>Which_Line_for_Position()</strong> , it is easy to obtain the number of a current line : just passing <strong>f.tell()</strong> as argument to the function</p>

<p>But <strong>WARNING</strong>: when using <strong>f.tell()</strong> and doing movements of the file's pointer in the file, it is absolutely necessary that the file is opened in binary mode: <strong>'rb'</strong> or <strong>'rb+'</strong> or <strong>'ab'</strong> or ....</p>
