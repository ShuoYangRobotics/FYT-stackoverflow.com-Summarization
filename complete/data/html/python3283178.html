<h3>Question (ID-3283178):</h3><h2>python and using 'self' in methods</h2><p>From what I read/understand, the 'self' parameter is similiar to 'this'.</p>

<p>Is that true?</p>

<p>If its optional, what would you do if self wasnt' passed into the method?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Yes, it's used in similar ways.  Note that it's a positional parameter and you can call it what you want; however there is a strong convention to call it <code>self</code> (not <code>this</code> or anything else).  Some positional parameter <em>must</em> be there for a usable instance method; it is not optional.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><code>self</code> is <code>this</code>, just you have to explicitly pass it and explicitly use it to refer to class methods/properties.</p>

<p>It isn't optional in class methods. You will get a <code>TypeError</code> if you try to define a classmethod without at least one argument (i.e., the <code>self</code> parameter).</p>

<p>However, you can call it something other than <code>self</code>, but I have never seen otherwise.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><strong>The joy of Python</strong></p>

<p>That is true to some extend. Methods are <strong>bound</strong> to the object instance they are a part of. When you see</p>

<p><code>def some_func(self, foo, bar)</code></p>

<p>The passing of self is <em>sometimes</em> implicit when you call, for example:</p>

<p><code>obj.some_func(foo_val, bar_val)</code></p>

<p>Which is equal (presuming <code>obj</code> is of class <code>MyClass</code>) to</p>

<p><code>MyClass.some_func(obj, foo_val, bar_val)</code></p>

<p>Because the method is bound to <code>obj</code>, the <code>self</code> argument gets populated. This is part of Python being explicit with what it means. In other languages, <code>this</code> just pops into scope, with Python there is some exposure of how this happens.</p>

<p>You can also pass methods around, and manually pass them <code>self</code> when not calling from a bound context.</p>

<pre><code>xf = x.f
while True:
   print xf()
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>will continue to print hello world until the end of time.</p>
  
  <p>What exactly happens when a method is called? You may have noticed that x.f() was called >without an argument above, even though the function definition for f() specified an >argument. What happened to the argument? Surely Python raises an exception when a function >that requires an argument is called without any — even if the argument isn’t actually >used...</p>
  
  <p>Actually, you may have guessed the answer: the special thing about methods is that the >object is passed as the first argument of the function. In our example, the call x.f() is >exactly equivalent to MyClass.f(x). In general, calling a method with a list of n arguments >is equivalent to calling the corresponding function with an argument list that is created >by inserting the method’s object before the first argument.</p>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>In classes a <code>self</code> variable (or <code>cls</code> for classmethods) is required. What you want to call it is your decision though. If you prefer you could call it <code>this</code> instead.</p>

<p>A <code>classmethod</code> is a method that gets the <code>class</code> as a first argument instead of a instance. It can be called without passing an instance.
i.e. with a <code>classmethod</code> you can do:</p>

<pre><code>SomeObject.some_class_method()
</code></pre>

<p>while a normal method would require you to do </p>

<pre><code>SomeObject().some_normal_method()
or
SomeObject.some_normal_method(instance)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p><code>self</code> refers to the object on which the method was called, much like <code>this</code> in C++. But it is important that <code>self</code> is merely a <em>convention</em>, you can name it as you like and pass instances of subclasses.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p><code>self</code> is definitely similar to <code>this</code>, however, in Python, the name <code>self</code> is just a convention, and could be named anything else. The variable is named after whatever you call it in the function's prototype (<code>def function(whatever, params...):</code>).</p>

<p>For instance methods, <code>self</code> IS actually required. For class or static methods, you need to specify that they should be treated as such, and then <code>self</code> is not required. For example:</p>

<pre><code>def type_to_display(type):
    """Converts a pass type to the full written pass type."""
    return list((pair[1] for pair in Pass.TYPE_CHOICES if pair[0] ==      
                          type[0:1].upper()))[0]                          
type_to_display = staticmethod(type_to_display)      
</code></pre>

<p>You will never be able to use an instance method in such a way that self is not passed in. For example, if I have an instance <code>my_car</code> of a <code>Car</code> class, and I use the <code>Car</code> class's <code>drive</code> instance method, the <code>my_car</code> instance will be implicitly passed into the <code>drive</code> method as the first parameter (<code>self</code>).</p>

<pre><code>class Car:
    def drive(self):
        self.do_some_stuff()

my_car = Car()
my_car.drive() # actually calls Car.drive(my_car)
</code></pre>
