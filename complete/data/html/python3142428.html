<h3>Question (ID-3142428):</h3><h2>"/1/2/3/".split("/")</h2><p>It's too hot &amp; I'm probably being retarded.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; "/1/2/3/".split("/")
['', '1', '2', '3','']
</code></pre>

<p>Whats with the empty elements at the start and end?</p>

<p>Edit: Thanks all, im putting this down to heat induced brain failure. The docs aren't quite the clearest though, from <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html</a></p>

<pre><code>"Return a list of the words in the string, using sep as the delimiter string"
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a word before the first, or after the last "/"?</p>

<p>Empty elements are still elements.</p>

<p>You could use <code>strip('/')</code> to trim the delimiter from the beginning/end of your string.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>As JLWarlow says, you have an extra '/' in the string. Here's another example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; "//2//3".split('/')
['', '', '2', '', '3']
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Slashes are <em>separators</em>, so there are empty elements before the first and after the last.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>you're splitting on <code>/</code>. You have 4 <code>/</code>, so, the list returned will have 5 elements.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>That is exactly what I would expect, but we are all different :)</p>

<p>What would you expect from: : "1,,2,3".split(",") ?</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You can use <code>strip()</code> to get rid of the leading and trailing fields... Then call <code>split()</code> as before.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><pre><code>[x for x in "//1///2/3///".split("/") if x != ""]
</code></pre>
