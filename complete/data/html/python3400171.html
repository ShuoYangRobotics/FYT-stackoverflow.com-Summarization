<h3>Question (ID-3400171):</h3><h2>Python UTF-8 comparison</h2><pre><code>a = {"a":"çö"}
b = "çö"
a['a']
&gt;&gt;&gt; '\xc3\xa7\xc3\xb6'

b.decode('utf-8') == a['a']
&gt;&gt;&gt; False
</code></pre>

<p>What is going in there? </p>

<p>edit= I'm sorry, it was my mistake. It is still False. I'm using Python 2.6 on Ubuntu 10.04.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p><code>b</code> is a <code>string</code>, <code>a</code> is a <code>dict</code></p>

<p>You want (I believe):</p>

<p><code>b == a['a']</code></p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><h2>Possible solutions</h2>

<p>Either write like this:</p>

<pre><code>a = {"a": u"çö"}
b = "çö"
b.decode('utf-8') == a['a']
</code></pre>

<p>Or like this (you may also skip the <code>.decode('utf-8')</code> on both sides):</p>

<pre><code>a = {"a": "çö"}
b = "çö"
b.decode('utf-8') == a['a'].decode('utf-8')
</code></pre>

<p>Or like this (my recommendation):</p>

<pre><code>a = {"a": u"çö"}
b = u"çö"
b == a['a']
</code></pre>

<h2>Explanation</h2>

<p><em>Updated based on Tim's comment.</em>  In your original code, <code>b.decode('utf-8') == u'çö'</code> and <code>a['a'] == 'çö'</code>, so you're actually making the following comparison:</p>

<pre><code>u'çö' == 'çö'
</code></pre>

<p>One of the objects is of type <code>unicode</code>, the other is of type <code>str</code>, so in order to execute the comparison, the <code>str</code> is converted to <code>unicode</code> and then the two <code>unicode</code> objects are compared. It works fine in the case of purely ASCII strings, for example: <code>u'a' == 'a'</code>, since <code>unicode('a') == u'a'</code>.</p>

<p>However, it fails in case of <code>u'çö' == 'çö'</code>, since <code>unicode('çö')</code> returns the following error: <em>UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc3 in position 0: ordinal not in range(128)</em>, and therefore the whole comparison returns False and issues the following warning: <em>UnicodeWarning: Unicode equal comparison failed to convert both arguments to Unicode - interpreting them as being unequal</em>.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Try
    b == a['a']</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You are comparing a string to a dict.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = {"a":"çö"}
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = "çö"
&gt;&gt;&gt; a == b
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; a['a'] == b
True
</code></pre>

<p>If you compare the string (b) to the member of a (a['a']), then you get the desired result.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>UTF-8 is an encoding used to record Unicode text in files. However, in Python you are working with objects that have a fixed way to represent Unicode text, and that way is not UTF-8.</p>

<p>You can still compare Unicode strings in Python, but this is unrelated to UTF-8, except that if you want to put constants into these Unicode strings, then you will need to encode the text of the file containing your source code, in UTF-8. As soon as the assignment operator is executed, the string is no longer UTF-8, but is now the Python internal representation.</p>

<p>By the way, if you are doing comparisons with Unicode, you probably will want to use the unicodedata module and normalize the strings before comparisons are done. </p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Make sure your code is in UTF-8 (NOT Latin-1) and/or use a coding line as so:</p>

<pre><code>#! /usr/bin/python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
a = {"a": u"çö"}
b = "çö"
assert b == a['a']
assert b.decode('utf-8') == a['a'].decode('utf-8')
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using unicode across the board, you can import unicode_literals from the future and cut back on encoding heartaches:</p>

<pre><code>#! /usr/bin/python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
from __future__ import unicode_literals
a = {"a": u"çö"}
b = "çö"
assert b == a['a']
assert b == a['a']
assert b.encode('utf-8') != a['a']
assert b.encode('utf-8') == a['a'].encode('utf-8')
</code></pre>

<p>If a file uses unicode_literals, all "strings" are now u"unicode" objects (per the coding of the file) if they're not b"prepended" with a b (to emulate the string/bytes split in Python 3.X).</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>NullUserException is right that this should be correct:</p>

<pre><code>b == a['a']
</code></pre>

<p>You're still getting "False" because you're decoding one side as utf-8 (creating a Unicode string) while the other side remains a utf-8 encoded byte string.</p>
