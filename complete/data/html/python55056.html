<h3>Question (ID-55056):</h3><h2>What's the best Django search app?</h2><p>I'm building a Django project that needs search functionality, and until there's a <code>django.contrib.search</code>, I have to choose a search app. So, which is the best? By "best" I mean...</p>

<ul>
<li>easy to install / set up</li>
<li>has a Django- or at least Python-friendly API</li>
<li>can perform reasonably complex searches</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some apps I've heard of, please suggest others if you know of any:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/djangosearch/" rel="nofollow">djangosearch</a></li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-sphinx/" rel="nofollow">django-sphinx</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I'd also like to avoid using a third-party search engine (like Google SiteSearch), because some of the data I'd like to index is for site members only and should not be public.</p>

Looks like it's well supported and documented.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Justin, I'd try <a href="http://code.google.com/p/djangosearch/" rel="nofollow">djangosearch</a> first: Jacob Kaplan-Moss (Django's lead developer) is working on it. </p>

<p>Potential hazards: </p>

<ul>
<li>The home page warns the API might not be entirely stable</li>
</ul>

<p>Potential benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>“The long term goal is for this to become <code>django.contrib.search</code>.”</li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I am searching for the same thing, as are a lot of other people. Let's hope that <em>django.contrib.search</em> will be added soon.</p>

<p>In the meantime, this is what I found:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/djangosearch/" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/djangosearch/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-sphinx/" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/django-sphinx/</a></li>

</ul>

<p>To me, most look quite complicated and, frankly, a little daunting to implement.
I'd be interested to learn what you think of these.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I'd recommend Sphinx for full-text search and aggregation, and django-sphinx is good enough for production use.  We found that Sphinx was the least resource-intensive and fastest way to index and search our documents and that django-sphinx was a nice wrapper on top of the sphinx client.</p>

<p>The group by aggregation is particularly nice, if for example you want to display how many documents with a certain tag or by a certain author (or both) matched a search.  In memory attribute updates were convenient too, especially for removing deleted articles immediately.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>The google code page for <a href="http://code.google.com/p/djangosearch/" rel="nofollow">djangosearch</a> indicates that it is no longer under active development, and suggests <a href="http://haystacksearch.org/" rel="nofollow">haystack</a> or <a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-solr-search/" rel="nofollow">solango</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Thanks Garth. I had seen that djangosearch wanted to become the official Django search, but I was hesitant to use it because I couldn't find any documentation! Luckily, there's a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/djangosearch/source/browse/branches/soc-new-backends/doc/README.txt" rel="nofollow">README in subversion</a> that I hadn't seen before, and it makes the API look very cool:</p>

<pre><code># set up the model
class Event(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    date = models.DateField()
    is_outdoors = models.BooleanField()

    index = djangosearch.ModelIndex(text=['title'], 
                                    additional=['date', 'is_outdoors'])

# run a search
results = Event.index.search("django conference")
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>You might want to consider letting Yahoo do all the hard work with their Build your own Search Service (BOSS).  Here is a great blog post that walks you through the process:

<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>You might want to look at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-solr-search/" rel="nofollow">Django Solr search</a> (aka "Solango") which comes with some nice documentation to get you started...</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>I just needed a <strong>very quick</strong> solution that was no-fuss for an internal app.</p>

<p>I found the article <a href="http://julienphalip.com/post/2825034077/adding-search-to-a-django-site-in-a-snap" rel="nofollow">Adding search to Django in a snap</a>, and that worked splendid for me! </p>

<p>Obviously it lacks the speed, scalability and features of the real projects like Haystack, but this one is easier to set up, and I don't really need anything else than keyword AND-search.</p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>If you have large amount of data to be indexed or you expect high traffic, I'd suggest using some external search engine, like <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/" rel="nofollow">Solr</a>. This way, you'll keep <em>shared-nothing</em> approach and be able to scale your site components independently.</p>
<br /><b>#10</b><br /><p>It looks like everyone here missed <a href="https://launchpad.net/django-xappy" rel="nofollow">django-xappy</a></p>

<p>After quick evaluation of all existing search addons for Django, I found this one as most flexible and easiest to use. It's rough on the edges in few places, but it's still the best way to use power of <a href="http://xapian.org" rel="nofollow">Xapian</a> search engine inside Django projects.</p>
<br /><b>#11</b><br /><p>I think I am going to have to give a shout out to Djapian.</p>

<p>It is rock-solid...just pull down a source distribution and peek inside. Top notch code, not very many comments tho..</p>

<p>It's still a young software project, but I think the django community should throw it's weight behind this one.</p>
<br /><b>#12</b><br /><p>Thanks Joe,</p>

<p>We decided to go with Tsearch2 and a custom postgres adaptor. Tsearch2 does not need an extra process to run, which was convenient since we are on a WebFaction hosting with limited  memory... It's not completely done yet, but seems to be a good solution...</p>
<br /><b>#13</b><br /><p>I found <a href="http://github.com/idangazit/djoosh/tree/master" rel="nofollow">Djoosh</a> which relies on the pure-python external search engine <a href="http://whoosh.ca/" rel="nofollow">Whoosh</a> to work well with my 'Python' brain.</p>
