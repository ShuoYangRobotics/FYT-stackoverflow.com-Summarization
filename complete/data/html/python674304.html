<h3>Question (ID-674304):</h3><h2>Python's use of __new__ and __init__?</h2><p>I'm just trying to streamline one of my classes and have introduced some functionality in the same style as the flyweight design pattern.</p>

<p>However, I'm a bit confused as to why <code>__init__</code> is always called after <code>__new__</code>. I wasn't expecting this. Can anyone tell me why this is happening and how I implement this functionality otherwise? (apart from putting the implementation into the <code>__new__</code> which feels quite hacky).</p>

<p>Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>class A(object):
    _dict = dict()

    def __new__(cls):
    	if 'key' in A._dict:
    		print "EXISTS"
    		return A._dict['key']
    	else:
    		print "NEW"
    		return super(A, cls).__new__(cls)

    def __init__(self):
    	print "INIT"
    	A._dict['key'] = self
    	print ""

a1 = A()
a2 = A()
a3 = A()
</code></pre>

<p>Outputs:</p>

<pre><code>NEW
INIT

EXISTS
INIT

EXISTS
INIT
</code></pre>

<p>Why?</p>

  <p><strong>__new__</strong> is the first step of instance creation.  It's called first, and is
  responsible for returning a new
  instance of your class.  In contrast,
  <strong>__init__</strong> doesn't return anything; it's only responsible for initializing the
  instance after it's been created.</p>
  
  <p>In general, you shouldn't need to

<p>You should consider that what you are trying to do is usually done with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory%5Fobject" rel="nofollow">Factory</a> and that's the best way to do it. Using <strong>__new__</strong> is not a good clean solution so please consider the usage of a factory. Here you have <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/86900/" rel="nofollow">a good factory example</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><strong><code>__new__</code></strong> is static class method, while <strong><code>__init__</code></strong> is instance method. 
<strong><code>__new__</code></strong> has to create the instance first, so <strong><code>__init__</code></strong> can initialize it. Note that <strong><code>__init__</code></strong> takes <strong><code>self</code></strong> as parameter. Until you create instance there is no <strong><code>self</code></strong>.</p>

<p>Now, I gather, that you're trying to implement <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern">singleton pattern</a> in Python. There are a few ways to do that.</p>

<p>Also, as of Python 2.6, you can use class <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0318/">decorators</a>. </p>

<pre><code>def singleton(cls):
    instances = {}
    def getinstance():
        if cls not in instances:
            instances[cls] = cls()
        return instances[cls]
    return getinstance

@singleton
class MyClass:
  ...
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>To quote the <a href="http://www.wingide.com/psupport/python-manual/2.4/ref/customization.html">documentation</a>:</p>

<p>"Typical implementations create a new instance of the class by invoking the superclass's __new__() method using "super(currentclass, cls).__new__(cls[, ...])"with appropriate arguments and then modifying the newly-created instance as necessary before returning it."</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>"If __new__() does not return an instance of cls, then the new instance's __init__() method will not be invoked.</p>

<p>__new__() is intended mainly to allow subclasses of immutable types (like int, str, or tuple) to customize instance creation."</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>__new__ should return a new, blank instance of a class. __init__ is then called to initialise that instance. You're not calling __init__ in the "NEW" case of __new__, so it's being called for you. The code that is calling <code>__new__</code> doesn't keep track of whether __init__ has been called on a particular instance or not nor should it, because you're doing something very unusual here.</p>

<p>You could add an attribute to the object in the __init__ function to indicate that it's been initialised. Check for the existence of that attribute as the first thing in __init__ and don't proceed any further if it has been.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>In most well-known OO languages, an expression like <code>SomeClass(arg1, arg2)</code> will allocate a new instance, initialise the instance's attributes, and then return it.</p>

<p>In most well-known OO languages, the "initialise the instance's attributes" part can be customised for each class by defining a <strong>constructor</strong>, which is basically just a block of code that operates on the new instance (using the arguments provided to the constructor expression) to set up whatever initial conditions are desired. In Python, this corresponds to the class' <code>__init__</code> method.</p>

<p>Python's <code>__new__</code> is nothing more and nothing less than similar per-class customisation of the "allocate a new instance" part. This of course allows you to do unusual things such as returning an existing instance rather than allocating a new one. So in Python, we shouldn't really think of this part as necessarily involving allocation; all that we require is that <code>__new__</code> comes up with a suitable instance from somewhere.</p>

<p>But it's still only half of the job, and there's no way for the Python system to know that sometimes you want to run the other half of the job (<code>__init__</code>) afterwards and sometimes you don't. If you want that behavior, you have to say so explicitly.</p>

<p>Often, you can refactor so you only need <code>__new__</code>, or so you don't need <code>__new__</code>, or so that <code>__init__</code> behaves differently on an already-initialised object. But if you really want to, Python does actually allow you to redefine "the job", so that <code>SomeClass(arg1, arg2)</code> doesn't necessarily call <code>__new__</code> followed by <code>__init__</code>. To do this, you need to create a metaclass, and define its <code>__call__</code> method.</p>

<p>A metaclass is just the class of a class. And a class' <code>__call__</code> method controls what happens when you call instances of the class. So a <em>metaclass</em>' <code>__call__</code> method controls what happens when you call a class; i.e. it allows you to <strong>redefine the instance-creation mechanism from start to finish</strong>. This is the level at which you can most elegantly implement a completely non-standard instance creation process such as the singleton pattern. In fact, with less than 10 lines of code you can implement a <code>Singleton</code> metaclass that then doesn't even require you to futz with <code>__new__</code> <strong>at all</strong>, and can turn <em>any</em> otherwise-normal class into a singleton by simply adding <code>__metaclass__ = Singleton</code>!</p>

<pre><code>class Singleton(type):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super(Singleton, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.__instance = None
    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        if self.__instance is None:
            self.__instance = super(Singleton, self).__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return self.__instance
</code></pre>

<p>However this is probably deeper magic than is really warranted for this situation!</p>

<p>Not much of a reason other than that it just is done that way. <code>__new__</code> doesn't have the responsibility of initializing the class, some other method does (<code>__call__</code>, possibly-- I don't know for sure).</p>

<p>You could have <code>__init__</code> do nothing if it's already been initialized, or you could write a new metaclass with a new <code>__call__</code> that only calls <code>__init__</code> on new instances, and otherwise just returns <code>__new__(...)</code>.</p>
