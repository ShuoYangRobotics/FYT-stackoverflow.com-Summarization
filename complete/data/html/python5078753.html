<h3>Question (ID-5078753):</h3><h2>Python "Hello World" on Windows</h2><p>I'm interested in learning Python for web development.</p>

<p>I need a simple set of instructions on how to set up a Python environment (for web development) on Windows and run a "Hello World" script in it as a web page (it should show in the browser).</p>

<hr>

<p>To give an example, here's what these instructions would look like if the question was about PHP:</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html</a> and download "XAMPP For Windows".</li>
<li>Run the installer to install it.</li>
<li>At this point you should have a file on your hard drive with the following path: C:\xampplite\htdocs\index.php. Open it!</li>
<li>Replace its content with the following line: <code>&lt;?php echo "Hello World"; ?&gt;</code></li>
<li>You're done. To see the result navigate to <code>http://localhost/</code> in your browser.</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, have a look at the <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/" rel="nofollow">Django tutorial</a> - they use the embedded server to run their sample project.</p>

<p>If you don't want Django, have a look at the python webframework list: <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/WebFrameworks" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.python.org/moin/WebFrameworks</a></p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Assuming, you have Python installed<br>
1. go to <a href="http://download.cherrypy.org/cherrypy/3.1.2/" rel="nofollow">http://download.cherrypy.org/cherrypy/3.1.2/</a><br>
2. click on <code>CherryPy-3.1.2.win32.exe</code> and download Windows installer of <code>CherryPy</code><br>
3. install <code>CherryPy</code><br>
4. go to the directory created by the file extraction and then go to tutorial directory, in my case it was <code>C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\cherrypy\tutorial</code><br>
5. run <code>python tut01_helloworld.py</code><br>
6. open in your browser <code>http://localhost:8080/</code></p>

<p>Voila.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If you just want to print "hello world" you can simply create and run the following Python file:</p>

<pre><code>import BaseHTTPServer
import SimpleHTTPServer

class TestHandler(SimpleHTTPServer.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler):

    def do_GET(self):
        self.wfile.write("hello world")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    server = BaseHTTPServer.HTTPServer(("", 8080), TestHandler)
    server.serve_forever()
</code></pre>

<p>This will serve "hello world" on <code>http://localhost:8080/</code>. Of course this is only a toy example. The next step would be to use the WSGI standard, making it compatible with a wide range of web servers (including Apache via <a href="http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/" rel="nofollow">modwsgi</a>). A simple "hello world" WSGI example is given in the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/wsgiref.html#module-wsgiref.validate" rel="nofollow">official documentation</a>.</p>

<p>For any serious web development you should probably choose one the numerous excellent web frameworks, as indicated in the other answers (e.g. see <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/deployment/modwsgi/" rel="nofollow">here</a> for the deployment of Django).</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I'd suggest starting Python web development with Flask. It's a modern, lightweight web framework with excellent documentation, right from the installation instructions: <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/installation/" rel="nofollow">http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/installation/</a></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Basically you should do these steps (each requiring some knowledge):</p>

<ol>
<li>install Apache</li>
<li>install Python</li>
<li><p>make your python 'hello_world' program like this:</p>

<p>#! (path to your python interpreter)\python.exe</p>

<p>print 'Content-type: text/plain;'</p>

<p>print 'Hello world'</p></li>
<li><p>make Apache pick that program by setting an alias in httpd.conf</p></li>
</ol>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>For web development in Python, you'll probably want to use one of the many available <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/WebFrameworks" rel="nofollow">web frameworks</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to get going very quickly and easily (without even having to install Python), try the <a href="http://www.web2py.com/examples/default/download" rel="nofollow">web2py</a> framework:</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="http://www.web2py.com/examples/default/download" rel="nofollow">http://www.web2py.com/examples/default/download</a> and download the <a href="http://www.web2py.com/examples/static/web2py_win.zip" rel="nofollow">For Windows</a> version under "Current".</li>
<li>Unzip the downloaded file and click the web2py.exe file in the extracted web2py folder.</li>
<li>Enter an admin password in the dialog box and click the 'start server' button.</li>
</ol>

<p>That's it. The 'Welcome' scaffolding app will automatically open up in your browser with a "Hello World" message. To edit the app or create a new one, go to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin" rel="nofollow">http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin</a> and enter your admin password, which will take you to the web-based IDE/admin interface (see online <a href="http://www.web2py.com/demo_admin/default/site" rel="nofollow">demo</a>). If you prefer, you can also edit application files in any editor or IDE (web2py applications are in the \web2py\applications\ folder).</p>

<p>Note, the web2py Windows (and Mac) binary distribution includes a Python interpreter, so it does not require an existing installation of Python. If you want to use your own Python installation, you can simply download the web2py <a href="http://www.web2py.com/examples/static/web2py_src.zip" rel="nofollow">source code</a> distribution instead (same process as above, but you'll click on web2py.py instead of web2py.exe to start web2py).</p>

<p>Although web2py is extremely easy to set up, learn, and use, it's also a well-integrated full-stack framework with lots of features and flexibility. It's got excellent <a href="http://www.web2py.com/book" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>, and if you need any help, there's a very friendly and responsive <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/web2py" rel="nofollow">mailing list</a>.</p>

<p>Note, if you're going to run your own Python installation on Windows, in addition to installing the <a href="http://python.org/download/" rel="nofollow">Windows binary</a>, be sure to install <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/" rel="nofollow">pywin32</a> as well.</p>
