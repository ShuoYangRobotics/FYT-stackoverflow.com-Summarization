<h3>Question (ID-400050):</h3><h2>Reading and running a mathematical expression in Python</h2><p>Using Python, how would I go about reading in (be from a string, file or url) a mathematical expression (1 + 1 is a good start) and executing it? </p>

<p>Aside from grabbing a string, file or url I have no idea of where to start with this.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Because python supports some algebraic forms, you could do:</p>

<pre><code>eval("1 + 1")
</code></pre>

<p>But this allows the input to execute about anything defined in your env:</p>

<pre><code>eval("__import__('sys').exit(1)")
</code></pre>

<p>Also, if you want to support something python doesn't support, the approach fails:</p>

<pre><code>x³ + y² + c
----------- = 0
     z
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of doing this, you can implement a tokenizer and a parser with <a href="http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/" rel="nofollow">ply</a>. Evaluating a thing like '1 + 1' ought not take more than ten lines or so.</p>

<p>You could also implement the tokenizer and the parser by hand. Read about LL and LR parsers. Before attempting this it's also better to learn using parser generators first.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>If you are receiving an expression as a string you'll need to parse it into its operators and operands and then process the resulting tree.  This isn't a python problem per se. but a general issue of how to deal with mathematical expressions delivered as strings.</p>

<p>A quick google reveals a bunch of lexical parsers for python.  </p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Don't writing your own parser unless you want to learn how to write a parser. As already mentioned in the comments by @J.F. Sebastian, I would suggest a full-on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra_system" rel="nofollow">computer algebra system (CAS)</a> like <a href="http://www.sagemath.org/" rel="nofollow">SAGE</a>. It will handle mathematical statements <strong>much</strong> more complicated than 1+1 :)</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Perhaps <code>eval</code> is what you're after?</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; eval('1+1')
2
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Read about the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow">input</a> function.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You can take advantage of Python's own evaluation capabilities. However, blind use of eval() is a very dangerous, since somebody can trick your program into:</p>

<pre><code>eval( (__import__("os").system("rm important_file") or 1) + 1)
</code></pre>

<p>The correct way to use eval is with the following receipe, which will make sure nothing dangerous is contained in the expression that you are evaluating:</p>
