<h3>Question (ID-1106223):</h3><h2>How are these type of python decorators written?</h2><p>I'd like to write a decorator that would limit the number of times a function can be executed, something along the following syntax :</p>

<pre><code>
@max_execs(5)
def my_method(*a,**k):
   # do something here
   pass
</code></pre>

<p>I think it's possible to write this type of decorator, but I don't know how. I think a function won't be this decorator's first argument, right? I'd like a "plain decorator" implementation, not some class with a <b><strong>call</strong></b> method.</p>

<p>The reason for this is to learn how they are written. Please explain the syntax, and how that decorator works.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>This is what I whipped up. It doesn't use a class, but it does use function attributes:</p>

<pre><code>def max_execs(n=5):
    def decorator(fn):
        fn.max = n
        fn.called = 0
        def wrapped(*args, **kwargs):
            fn.called += 1
            if fn.called &lt;= fn.max:
                return fn(*args, **kwargs)
            else:
                # Replace with your own exception, or something
                # else that you want to happen when the limit
                # is reached
                raise RuntimeError("max executions exceeded")
        return wrapped
    return decorator
</code></pre>

<p><code>max_execs</code> returns a functioned called <code>decorator</code>, which in turn returns <code>wrapped</code>. <code>decoration</code> stores the max execs and current number of execs in two function attributes, which then get checked in <code>wrapped</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Translation:</strong> When using the decorator like this:</p>

<pre><code>@max_execs(5)
def f():
    print "hi!"
</code></pre>

<p>You're basically doing something like this:</p>

<pre><code>f = max_execs(5)(f)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Decorator is merely a callable that transforms a function into something else. In your case, <code>max_execs(5)</code> must be a callable that transforms a function into another callable object that will count and forward the calls.</p>

<pre><code>class helper:
    def __init__(self, i, fn):
        self.i = i
        self.fn = fn
    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        if self.i &gt; 0:
            self.i = self.i - 1
            return self.fn(*args, **kwargs)

class max_execs:
    def __init__(self, i):
        self.i = i
    def __call__(self, fn):
        return helper(self.i, fn)
</code></pre>

<p>I don't see why you would want to limit yourself to a function (and not a class). But if you really want to...</p>

<pre><code>def max_execs(n):
    return lambda fn, i=n: return helper(i, fn)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>There are two ways of doing it.  The object-oriented way is to make a class:</p>

<pre><code>class max_execs:
    def __init__(self, max_executions):
        self.max_executions = max_executions
        self.executions = 0

    def __call__(self, func):
        @wraps(func)
        def maybe(*args, **kwargs):
            if self.executions &lt; self.max_executions:
                self.executions += 1
                return func(*args, **kwargs)
            else:
                print "fail"
        return maybe
</code></pre>

<p>See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/308999/what-does-functools-wraps-do">this question</a> for an explanation of <code>wraps</code>.</p>

<p>I prefer the above OOP approach for this kind of decorator, since you've basically got a private count variable tracking the number of executions.  However, the other approach is to use a closure, such as</p>

<pre><code>def max_execs(max_executions):
    executions = [0]
    def actual_decorator(func):
        @wraps(func)
        def maybe(*args, **kwargs):
            if executions[0] &lt; max_executions:
                executions[0] += 1
                return func(*args, **kwargs)
            else:
                print "fail"
        return maybe
    return actual_decorator
</code></pre>

<p>This involved three functions.  The <code>max_execs</code> function is given a parameter for the number of executions and returns a decorator that will restrict you to that many calls.  That function, the <code>actual_decorator</code>, does the same thing as our <code>__call__</code> method in the OOP example.  The only weirdness is that since we don't have a class with private variables, we need to mutate the <code>executions</code> variable which is in the outer scope of our closure.  Python 3.0 supports this with the <code>nonlocal</code> statement, but in Python 2.6 or earlier, we need to wrap our executions count in a list so that it can be mutated.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Without relying to a state in a class, you have to save the state (count) in the function itself:</p>

<pre><code>def max_execs(count):
    def new_meth(meth):
        meth.count = count
        def new(*a,**k):
            meth.count -= 1
            print meth.count            
            if meth.count&gt;=0:
                return meth(*a,**k)
        return new
    return new_meth

@max_execs(5)
def f():
    print "invoked"

[f() for _ in range(10)]
</code></pre>

<p>It gives:</p>

<pre><code>5
invoked
4
invoked
3
invoked
2
invoked
1
invoked
0
-1
-2
-3
-4
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>This method does not modify function internals, instead wraps it into a callable object.</p>

<p>Using class slows down execution by ~20% vs using the patched function!</p>

<pre><code>def max_execs(n=1):
    class limit_wrapper:
        def __init__(self, fn, max):
            self.calls_left = max
            self.fn = fn
        def __call__(self,*a,**kw):
            if self.calls_left &gt; 0:
                self.calls_left -= 1
                return self.fn(*a,**kw)
            raise Exception("max num of calls is %d" % self.i)


    def decorator(fn):
        return limit_wrapper(fn,n)

    return decorator

@max_execs(2)
def fun():
    print "called"
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I know you said you didn't want a class, but unfortunately that's the only way I can think of how to do it off the top of my head.</p>

<pre><code>class mymethodwrapper:
    def __init__(self):
        self.maxcalls = 0
    def mymethod(self):
        self.maxcalls += 1
        if self.maxcalls &gt; 5:
            return
        #rest of your code
        print "Code fired!"
</code></pre>

<p>Fire it up like this</p>

<pre><code>a = mymethodwrapper
for x in range(1000):
    a.mymethod()
</code></pre>

<p>The output would be:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; Code fired!
&gt;&gt;&gt; Code fired!
&gt;&gt;&gt; Code fired!
&gt;&gt;&gt; Code fired!
&gt;&gt;&gt; Code fired!
</code></pre>
