<h3>Question (ID-448034):</h3><h2>Multithreaded Resource Access - Where Do I Put My Locks?</h2><p>I have threaded code where each thread needs to write to the same file.  To prevent concurrency issues, I am using a Lock object.</p>

<p>My question is whether I am using the Lock correctly.  If I set the lock from within each thread, is that lock global or only specific to that specific thread?</p>

<p>Basically, should I create a Lock first and pass its reference to each thread, or is it ok to set it from within the thread like I do here:</p>

<pre><code>import time
from threading import Thread, Lock

def main():
    for i in range(20):
        agent = Agent(i)
        agent.start()

class Agent(Thread):
    def __init__(self, thread_num):
        Thread.__init__(self)
        self.thread_num = thread_num

    def run(self):
        while True:
            print 'hello from thread %s' % self.thread_num
            self.write_result()   

    def write_result(self):
        lock = Lock()
        lock.acquire()
        try:
            f = open('foo.txt', 'a')
            f.write('hello from thread %s\n' % self.thread_num)
            f.flush()
            f.close()
        finally:
            lock.release()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

<pre><code>class LockedWrite(file):
    """ Wrapper class to a file object that locks writes """
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwds):
        super(LockedWrite, self).__init__(*args, **kwds)
        self._lock = Lock()

    def write(self, *args, **kwds):
        self._lock.acquire()
        try:
            super(LockedWrite, self).write(*args, **kwds)
        finally:
            self._lock.release()
</code></pre>

<p>To use in your code just replace following functions:</p>

<pre><code>def main():
    f = LockedWrite('foo.txt', 'a')

    for i in range(20):
        agent = Agent(i, f)
        agent.start()

class Agent(Thread):
    def __init__(self, thread_num, fileobj):
        Thread.__init__(self)
        self.thread_num = thread_num
        self._file = fileobj    

#   ...

    def write_result(self):
        self._file.write('hello from thread %s\n' % self.thread_num)
</code></pre>

<p>This approach puts file locking in the file itself which seems cleaner IMHO</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Create the lock outside the method.</p>

<pre><code>class Agent(Thread):
    mylock = Lock()
    def write_result(self):
        self.mylock.acquire()
        try:
            ...
        finally:
            self.mylock.release()
</code></pre>

<p>or if using python >= 2.5:</p>

<pre><code>class Agent(Thread):
    mylock = Lock()
    def write_result(self):
        with self.mylock:
            ...
</code></pre>

<p>To use that with python 2.5 you must import the statement from the future:</p>

<pre><code>from __future__ import with_statement
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>The lock() method returns a lock object for every call. So every thread ( actually every call to write_result ) will have a different lock object. And there will be no locking. </p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The lock that's used needs to be common to all threads, or at least ensure that two locks can't lock the same resource at the same time.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>The lock instance should be associated with the file instance.</p>

<p>In other words, you should create both the lock and file at the same time and pass both to each thread.</p>

<p>MSN</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You can simplify things a bit (at the cost of slightly more overhead) by designating a single thread (probably created exclusively for this purpose) as the sole thread that writes to the file, and have all other threads delegate to the file-writer by placing the string that they want to add to the file into a <code>queue.Queue</code> object.  </p>

<p>Queues have all of the locking built-in, so any thread can safely call <code>Queue.put()</code> at any time.  The file-writer would be the only thread calling <code>Queue.get()</code>, and can presumably spend much of its time blocking on that call (with a reasonable timeout to allow the thread to cleanly respond to a shutdown request).  All of the synchronization issues will be handled by the Queue, and you'll be spared having to worry about whether you've forgotten some lock acquire/release somewhere... :)</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I'm pretty sure that the lock needs to be the same object for each thread. Try this:</p>

<pre><code>import time
from threading import Thread, Lock

def main():
    lock = Lock()
    for i in range(20):
        agent = Agent(i, lock)
        agent.start()

class Agent(Thread, Lock):
    def __init__(self, thread_num, lock):
        Thread.__init__(self)
        self.thread_num = thread_num
        self.lock = lock

    def run(self):
        while True:
            print 'hello from thread %s' % self.thread_num
            self.write_result()   

    def write_result(self):
        self.lock.acquire()
        try:
            f = open('foo.txt', 'a')
            f.write('hello from thread %s\n' % self.thread_num)
            f.flush()
            f.close()
        finally:
            lock.release()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</code></pre>
