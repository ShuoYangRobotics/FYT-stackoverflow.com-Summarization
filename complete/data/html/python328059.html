<h3>Question (ID-328059):</h3><h2>Create a List that contain each Line of a File</h2><p>I'm trying to open a file and afterwards create a list with each line read from the file.</p>

<pre><code>   i=0
   List=[""]
   for Line in inFile:
      List[i]=Line.split(",")
      i+=1
   print List
</code></pre>

<p>But this sample code gives me an error because of the i+=1 saying that index is out of range.
What's my problem here? How can I write the code in order to increment my list with every new Line in the InFile?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>It's a lot easier than that:</p>

<pre><code>List = open("filename.txt").readlines()
</code></pre>

<p>This returns a list of each line in the file.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><pre><code>my_list = [line.split(',') for line in open("filename.txt")]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>A file is <em>almost</em> a list of lines.  You can trivially use it in a <strong>for</strong> loop.</p>

<pre><code>myFile= open( "SomeFile.txt", "r" )
for x in myFile:
    print x
myFile.close()
</code></pre>

<p>Or, if you want an actual list of lines, simply create a list from the file.</p>

<pre><code>myFile= open( "SomeFile.txt", "r" )
myLines = list( myFile )
myFile.close()
print len(myLines), myLines
</code></pre>

<p>You can't do <code>someList[i]</code> to put a <em>new</em> item at the end of a list.  You must do <code>someList.append(i)</code>.</p>

<p>Also, <em>never</em> start a simple variable name with an uppercase letter.  <code>List</code> confuses folks who know Python.</p>

<p>Also, <em>never</em> use a built-in name as a variable.  <code>list</code> is an existing data type, and using it as a variable confuses folks who know Python.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>f.readlines() returns a list that contains each line as an item in the list</p>

<p>if you want eachline to be split(",") you can use list comprehensions</p>

<pre><code>[ list.split(",") for line in file ]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Please read <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow">PEP8</a>.  You're swaying pretty far from python conventions.</p>

<p>If you want a list of lists of each line split by comma, I'd do this:</p>

<pre><code>l = []
for line in in_file:
    l.append(line.split(','))
</code></pre>

<p>You'll get a newline on each record.  If you don't want that:</p>

<pre><code>l = []
for line in in_file:
    l.append(line.rstrip().split(','))
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I am not sure about Python but most languages have push/append function for arrays.</p>
