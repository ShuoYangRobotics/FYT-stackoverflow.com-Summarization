<h3>Question (ID-1885868):</h3><h2>Pythonic way to ignore for loop control variable</h2><p>A Python program I'm writing is to read a set number of lines from the top of a file, and the program needs to preserve this header for future use.  Currently, I'm doing something similar to the following:</p>

<pre><code>    header = ''
    header_len = 4
    for i in range(1, header_len):
        header += file_handle.readline()
</code></pre>

<p>Pylint complains that I'm not using the variable i.  What would be a more pythonic way to do this?</p>

<p>Edit:  The purpose of the program is to intelligently split the original file into smaller files, each of which contains the original header and a subset of the data.  So, I need to read and preserve just the header before reading the rest of the file.</p>

<p>Edit 2:  Changed the question title (from "Pythonic way to read a set number of lines from a file") since similar questions were coming up and apparently not getting referred to this one.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><pre><code>import itertools

header_lines = list(itertools.islice(file_handle, header_len))
# or
header = "".join(itertools.islice(file_handle, header_len))
</code></pre>

<p>Note that with the first, the newline chars will still be present, to strip them:</p>

<pre><code>header_lines = list(n.rstrip("\n")
                    for n in itertools.islice(file_handle, header_len))
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I'm not sure what the Pylint rules are, but you could use the '_' throwaway variable name.</p>

<pre><code>header = ''
header_len = 4
for _ in range(1, header_len):
    header += file_handle.readline()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>My best answer is as follows:</p>

<p>file test.dat:</p>

<pre><code>This is line 1
This is line 2
This is line 3
This is line 4
This is line 5
This is line 6
This is line 7
This is line 8
This is line 9
</code></pre>

<p>Python script:</p>

<pre><code>f = open('test.dat')
nlines = 4
header = "".join(f.readline() for _ in range(nlines))
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; header
'This is line 1\nThis is line 2\nThis is line 3\nThis is line 4\n'
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that you don't need to call any modules; also that you could use any dummy variable in place of <code>_</code> (it works with <code>i</code>, or <code>j</code>, or <code>ni</code>, or whatever) but I recomend you don't (to avoid confusion). You could strip the newline characters (though I don't recommend you do - this way you can distinguish among lines) or do anything that you can do with strings in Python.</p>

<p>Notice that I did not provide a mode for opening the file, so it defaults to "read only" - this is not Pythonic; in Python "explicit is better than implicit". Finally, nice people close their files; in this case it is automatic (because the script ends) but it is best practice to close them using <code>f.close()</code>.</p>

<p>Happy Pythoning.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: As pointed out by Roger Pate the square brackets are unnecessary in the list comprehension, thereby reducing the line by two characters. The original script has been edited to reflect this.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><pre><code>f = open('fname')
header = [next(f) for _ in range(header_len)]
</code></pre>

<p>Since you're going to write header back to the new files, you don't need to do anything with it. To write it back to the new file:</p>

<pre><code>open('new', 'w').writelines(header + list_of_lines)
</code></pre>

<p>if you know the number of lines in the old file, <code>list_of_lines</code> would become:</p>

<pre><code>list_of_lines = [next(f) for _ in range(chunk_len)]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>May be this:</p>

<pre><code>header_len = 4
header = open("file.txt").readlines()[:header_len]
</code></pre>

<p>But, it will be troublesome for long files.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I do not see any thing wrong with your solution, may be just replace i with _, I also do not like invoking itertools everywhere where simpler solution will work, it is like people using jQuery for trivial javascript tasks. anyway just to have itertools revenge here is my solution</p>

<p>as you want to read whole file anyway line by line, why not just first read header and after that do whatever you want to do</p>

<pre><code>header = ''
header_len = 4

for i, line in enumerate(file_handle):
    if i &lt; header_len:
        header += line
    else:
        # output chunks to separate files
        pass

print header
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>What about:</p>

<pre><code>header = []
for i,l in enumerate(file_handle):
    if i &lt;= 3: 
         header += l
         continue
    #proc rest of file here
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><pre><code>s=""
f=open("file")
for n,line in enumerate(f):
  if n&lt;=3 : s=s+line
  else:
      # do something here to process the rest of the lines          
print s
f.close()
</code></pre>
