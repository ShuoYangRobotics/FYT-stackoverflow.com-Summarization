<h3>Question (ID-575385):</h3><h2>Why not always use psyco for Python code?</h2><p><a href="http://psyco.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">psyco</a> seems to be quite helpful in optimizing Python code, and it does it in a very non-intrusive way. </p>

<p>Therefore, one has to wonder. Assuming you're always on a x86 architecture (which is where most apps run these days), why not just always use <code>psyco</code> for all Python code? Does it make mistakes sometimes and ruins the correctness of the program? Increases the runtime for some weird cases?</p>

<p>Have you had any negative experiences with it? My most negative experience so far was that it made my code faster by only 15%. Usually it's better.</p>

<p>Naturally, using psyco is not a replacement for efficient algorithms and coding. But if you can improve the performance of your code for the cost of two lines (importing and calling psyco), I see no good reason not to.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>1) The memory overhead is the main one, as described in other answers. You also pay the compilation cost, which can be prohibitive if you aren't selective. From the <a href="http://psyco.sourceforge.net/psycoguide/module-psyco.html" rel="nofollow">user reference</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Compiling everything is often overkill for medium- or large-sized applications. The drawbacks of compiling too much are in the time spent compiling, plus the amount of memory that this process consumes. It is a subtle balance to keep. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>2) Performance can actually be harmed by Psyco compilation. Again from the user guide (<a href="http://psyco.sourceforge.net/psycoguide/tutknownbugs.html" rel="nofollow">"known bugs"</a> section):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are also performance bugs: situations in which Psyco slows down the code instead of accelerating it. It is difficult to make a complete list of the possible reasons, but here are a few common ones:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>The built-in <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code> functions must be avoided and replaced by list comprehension. For example, <code>map(lambda x: x*x, lst)</code> should be replaced by the more readable but more recent syntax <code>[x*x for x in lst]</code>.</li>
  <li>The compilation of regular expressions doesn't seem to benefit from Psyco. (The execution of regular expressions is unaffected, since it is C code.) Don't enable Psyco on this module; if necessary, disable it explicitely, e.g. by calling <code>psyco.cannotcompile(re.compile)</code>.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>3) Finally, there are some relatively obscure situations where using Psyco will actually introduce bugs. Some of them are <a href="http://psyco.sourceforge.net/psycoguide/bugs.html#bugs" rel="nofollow">listed here</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><blockquote>
  <p>Psyco currently uses a lot of memory.
  It only runs on Intel 386-compatible
  processors (under any OS) right now.
  There are some subtle semantic
  differences (i.e. bugs) with the way
  Python works; they should not be
  apparent in most programs.</p>

<p>See also the <a href="http://psyco.sourceforge.net/psycoguide/node25.html" rel="nofollow">caveats section</a>.  For a hard example, I noticed that my web app with Cheetah-generated templates and DB I/O gained no appreciable speedup.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>When using pyglet I found that I couldn't use psyco on the entire app without making my app non-functional. I could use it in small sections of math-heavy code, of course, but it wasn't necessary, so I didn't bother.</p>

<p>Also, psyco has done strange things with my profiling results (such as, well, not alter them at all from the non-psyco version). I suspect it doesn't play nice with the profiling code. </p>

<p>I just don't really use it unless I really want the speed, which is not all that often. My priority is algorithm optimization, which generally results in nicer speedups.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>It also depends where your bottleneck is. I am mostly doing web apps and there the bottlenecks are probably more IO and database. So you should know where to optimize.</p>

<p>Also beware that maybe you first should think about your code instead of directly throwing psyco at it. So I agree with Devin, that algorithm optimizations should come first and they might have a smaller chance of unwanted sideeffects.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>One should never rely on some magic bullet to fix your problems. Using psyco to make a slow program faster is usually not necessary. Bad algorithms can be rewritten, and parts that <em>require</em> speed could be written in another language. Of course, your question asks why we don't use it for the speed boost anyways, and there's a bit of overhead when you use psyco. Psyco uses memory, and those two lines just sorta <em>feel</em> like overhead when you look at them. As for my personal reason on why I don't use psyco, it's because it doesn't support x86_64, which I see as the new up and coming architecture (especially with 2038 approaching sooner or later). My alternative is pypy, but I'm not entirely fond of that either.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Quite simply: "Because the code already runs fast enough".</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>A couple of other things:</p>

<ol>
<li>It doesn't seem to be very actively maintained.</li>
<li>It can be a memory hog.</li>
