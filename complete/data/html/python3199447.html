<h3>Question (ID-3199447):</h3><h2>Python Beginner - Slice Question</h2><p>Well I am practicing slicing and want to run a program that prints a name backwards.</p>

<p>Mainly, I want to know how to access the last item in the sequence.</p>

<p>I wrote the following:</p>

<pre><code>name = raw_input("Enter Your Name: ")
backname = ???

print backname
</code></pre>

<p>Does this look sound? Obviously, the ??? are not apart of my syntax, just asking what should go there. Thanks ahead of time!</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><pre><code>backname[-1] #the last item in the sequence

 #To reverse backname (the long way):
aList = [c for c in backname]  #will give you ['1', '2', ..., 'n']
aList.reverse()                #aList will be ['n', ..., '2', '1] 
backname = "".join(aList)      #backname reversed

 #To reverse backname, as other answers replied:
 backname[::-1]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>To access the last item in a sequence, use:</p>

<pre><code>print name[-1]
</code></pre>

<p>This is the same as:</p>

<pre><code>print name[len(name) - 1]
</code></pre>

<p>Reversing a sequence has a common idiom in Python:</p>

<pre><code>backname = name[::-1]
</code></pre>

<p>The <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/509211/good-primer-for-python-slice-notation">Good primer for Python slice notation</a> question has more complete information.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You want <code>name[::-1]</code>.  The -1 is the "step" of the slice-- if you wanted every other letter, for example, you would use <code>name[::2]</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You can use negative indices to access items counting from the end of a list, so <code>name[-1]</code> will give you the last character. However, the third slice argument is a step, which can also be negative, so this will give you the whole string in reverse:</p>

<pre><code>name[::-1]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>With slice syntax, you would use:</p>

<pre><code>backname = name[::-1]
</code></pre>

<p>The two colons show that the first two parameters to the slice are left at their defaults, so start at the beginning, process to the end, but step backwards (the -1).</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You probably want to read the docs:
<a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-str-unicode-list-tuple-buffer-xrange" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-str-unicode-list-tuple-buffer-xrange</a></p>

<p>There's a method to reverse the string for you, if you want. For the specific question you asked, to access the last item of a sequence you use "seq[-1]".</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>It does look sound. And your second line should be</p>

<pre><code>backname = name[::-1]
</code></pre>
