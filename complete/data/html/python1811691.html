<h3>Question (ID-1811691):</h3><h2>running an outside program (executable) in python?</h2><p>I just started working on python and I have been trying to run an outside executable form python.
I have an executable for a program written in Fortran. Lets say the name for the executable is flow.exe. And my executable is lacated in C:\Documents and Settings\flow_model
I tried both os.system and popen commands but so far couldnt make it work.
The following code seems like opens the command window but wouldnt execute the model.</p>

<pre><code># Import system modules
import sys, string, os, arcgisscripting
os.system("C:/Documents and Settings/flow_model/flow.exe")
</code></pre>

<p>Any suggestions out there? Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Is that trying to execute <code>C:\Documents</code> with arguments of <code>"and", "Settings/flow_model/flow.exe"</code> ?</p>

<p>Also, you might consider <code>subprocess.call()</code></p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Try</p>

<pre><code>import subprocess
subprocess.call(["C:/Documents and Settings/flow_model/flow.exe"])
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Those whitespaces can really be a bother:-(.  Try <code>os.chdir('C:/Documents\ and\ Settings/')</code> followed by relative paths for <code>os.system</code>, <code>subprocess</code> methods, or whatever...</p>

<p>If best-effort attempts to bypass the whitespaces-in-path hurdle keep failing, then my next best suggestion is to <strong>avoid</strong> having blanks in your crucial paths.  Couldn't you make a blanks-less directory, copy the crucial <code>.exe</code> file there, and try <strong>that</strong>?  Are those havoc-wrecking space absolutely essential to your well-being...?</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>your usage is correct, i bet that your external program, flow.exe, needs to be executed in its directory because it accesses some external files stored there. </p>

<p>so you might try:</p>

<pre><code>import sys, string, os, arcgisscripting
os.chdir( 'c:\\documents and settings\\flow_model' )
os.system( '"C:\\Documents and Settings\\flow_model\\flow.exe"' )
</code></pre>

<p>(beware of the double quotes inside the single quotes...)</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>That's the correct usage, but perhaps the spaces in the path name are messing things up for some reason.</p>

<p>You may want to run the program under cmd.exe as well so you can see any output from flow.exe that might be indicating an error.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I like more <code>subprocess.Popen</code> instead of <code>call</code>. It gives you more control. See <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/subprocess.html#module-subprocess" rel="nofollow">here</a> for details.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I'd try inserting an 'r' in front of your path if I were you, to indicate that its a raw string - and then you won't have to use forward slashes, for example:</p>

<pre><code>os.system(r"C:\Documents and Settings\flow_model\flow.exe")
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>If it were me, I'd put the exe in the root diretcory (C:) and see if it works like that. If so, it's probably the (already mentioned) spaces in the directory name. If not, it may be some environment variables.</p>

<p>Also, try to check you stderr (using an earlier answer by int3):</p>

<pre><code>import subprocess
process = subprocess.Popen(["C:/Documents and Settings/flow_model/flow.exe"], \
                           stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
if process.stderr:
    print process.stderr.readlines()
</code></pre>

<p>The code might not be entirely correct as I usually don't use Popen or windows, but should give the idea. It might well be that the error message is on the error stream.</p>
