<h3>Question (ID-3401154):</h3><h2>Splitting a list</h2><p>I've scoured various resources and can't figure out how to do a rather simple operation.</p>

<p>Right now, I have a list as follows:</p>

<pre><code>li = [['a=b'],['c=d']]
</code></pre>

<p>I want to transform this into:</p>

<pre><code>li = [['a','b'],['c','d']]
</code></pre>

<p>As I understand it, <code>split("=")</code> only applies to string types.  Is there an equivalent method for lists?</p>

<p>Pardon the simplicity of my question...</p>

<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You want this:</p>

<pre><code>[x[0].split('=') for x in li]
# prints [['a', 'b'], ['c', 'd']]
</code></pre>

<p>To grab a question from a comment further down the post, the reason split works for x[0] is that x represents the inner list.  That's accomplished by the <code>for x in li</code>.  Also, I fixed mine to read <code>for x in li</code> and not <code>for x in test</code> as I had assigned your examples to a variable called 'test' on my system.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You can use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#map" rel="nofollow"><code>map()</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; li = [['a=b'],['c=d']]
&gt;&gt;&gt; map(lambda x: x[0].split('='), li)
[['a', 'b'], ['c', 'd']]
</code></pre>

<p>This traverses the list <code>li</code> and applies the <code>lambda</code> function to every element. As every element of the list is again a list with one element, <code>x[0]</code> takes this element, which is a string, splits it and returns a new list with both values.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Warning - its been a while since I did any python, but your issue is more general.</p>

<p>You are correct in that split applies to strings. </p>

<p>What you need to do is split the VALUE contained in your list not the list itself.</p>

<p>So you would do something like</p>

<pre><code>newValue = split('=', li[0][0]) 
li[0] = newValue
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Is this what you are looking for ?
<code>map(lambda y:y.split('='),map(lambda x:x[0], li))</code></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Presuming each sublist consists of individual strings of the form <code>a=b</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; [el[i].split('=') for el in li for i in range(len(el))]
[['a', 'b'], ['c', 'd']]
</code></pre>

<p>(Indeed, what you're splitting is the inner string <code>a=b</code>. So the <code>split()</code> string method works fine.)</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: A much more elegant way of doing this double list comprehension is:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; [a.split('=') for el in li for a in el]
[['a', 'b'], ['c', 'd']]
</code></pre>

<p>There have been a number of good suggestions made, so the OP should be able to learn a good amount of Python for it. Important to remember is that what is being split is li[i][j], ie an item of the list that is an item of the list li.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You can do it with this:</p>

<pre><code>[k[0].split("=") for k in li]
</code></pre>
