<h3>Question (ID-2429511):</h3><h2>Why do people write #!/usr/bin/env python on the first line of a Python script?</h2><p>It seems to me like the files run the same without that line.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-9):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>If you have several versions of Python installed, <code>/usr/bin/env</code> will ensure the interpreter used is the first one on your environment's <code>$PATH</code>. The alternative would be to hardcode something line <code>#!/usr/bin/python</code> or the like -- that's OK but less flexible.</p>

<p>In Unix, an executable file that's meant to be interpreted must indicate what interpreter to use by having a <code>#!</code> at the start of the first line, followed by the interpreter (and any flags it may need); otherwise, I believe the default is <code>/bin/sh</code>.</p>

<p>If you're talking about other platforms, of course, this rule does not apply (but that "shebang line" does no harm, and will help if you ever copy that script to a platform <em>with</em> a Unix base, such as Linux, Mac, etc).</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>That is called the <a href="http://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/shebang/" rel="nofollow">shebang line</a>. As the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_%28Unix%29" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia entry explains</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In computing, a shebang (also called a hashbang, hashpling, pound bang, or crunchbang) refers to the characters "#!" when they are the first two characters in an interpreter directive as the first line of a text file. In a Unix-like  operating system, the program loader takes the presence of these two characters as an indication that the file is a script, and tries to execute that script using the interpreter  specified by the rest of the first line in the file.</p>

<p>Even on Windows, where the shebang line does not determine the interpreter to be run, you can pass options to the interpreter by specifying them on the shebang line. I find it useful to keep a generic shebang line in one-off scripts (such as the ones I write when answering questions on SO), so I can quickly test them on both Windows and <a href="http://www.archlinux.org/" rel="nofollow">ArchLinux</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://ss64.com/bash/env.html" rel="nofollow">env utility</a> allows you to invoke a command on the path:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first remaining argument specifies the program name to invoke; it is searched for according to the <code>PATH</code> environment variable. Any remaining arguments are passed as arguments to that program.</p>
</blockquote>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Expanding a bit on the other answers, here's a little example of how your command line scripts can get into trouble by incautious use of <code>/usr/bin/env</code> shebang lines:</p>

<pre><code>$ /usr/local/bin/python -V
Python 2.6.4
$ /usr/bin/python -V
Python 2.5.1
$ cat my_script.py 
#!/usr/bin/env python
import json
print "hello, json"
$ PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin
$ ./my_script.py 
hello, json
$ PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin
$ ./my_script.py 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./my_script.py", line 2, in &lt;module&gt;
    import json
ImportError: No module named json
</code></pre>

<p>The json module doesn't exist in Python 2.5.</p>

<p>One way to guard against that kind of problem is to use the versioned python command names that are typically installed with most Pythons:</p>

<pre><code>$ cat my_script.py 
#!/usr/bin/env python2.6
import json
print "hello, json"
</code></pre>

<p>If you just need to distinguish between Python 2.x and Python 3.x, recent releases of Python 3 also provide a <code>python3</code> name:</p>

<pre><code>$ cat my_script.py 
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import json
print("hello, json")
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The main reason to do this is to make the script portable across operating system environments.  </p>

<p>For example under mingw, python scripts use :</p>

<pre><code>#!/c/python3k/python 
</code></pre>

<p>and under GNU/Linux distribution it is either:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/local/bin/python 
</code></pre>

<p>or </p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python
</code></pre>

<p>and under the best commercial Unix sw/hw system of all (OS/X), it is:</p>

<pre><code>#!/Applications/MacPython 2.5/python
</code></pre>

<p>or on FreeBSD:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/local/bin/python
</code></pre>

<p>However all these differences can make the script portable across all by using:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Technically, in Python, this is just a comment line.</p>

<p>This line is only used if you run the py script <em>from the shell</em> (from the command line).  This is know as the "<em>Shebang</em>!" and is used in various situations, not just with Python scripts<br>
Here, it instructs the shell to start [a specific version of] Python (to take care of the rest of the file.)</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><blockquote>
  <p>It seems to me like the files run the same without that line.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If so, then perhaps you're running the Python program on Windows? Windows doesn't use that line—instead, it uses the file-name extension to run the program associated with the file extension.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>This is a shell convention that tells the shell which program can execute the script.</p>

<pre>#!/usr/bin/env python</pre>

<p>resolves to a path to the Python binary.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>It's recommended way, proposed in documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2.2.2. Executable Python Scripts</p>
  
  <p>On BSD’ish Unix systems, Python scripts can be made directly
  executable, like shell scripts, by putting the line</p>

<pre><code>#! /usr/bin/env python3.2
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>from <a href="http://docs.python.org/py3k/tutorial/interpreter.html#executable-python-scripts" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/py3k/tutorial/interpreter.html#executable-python-scripts</a></p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>If you have a few scripting file which has <code>#!/usr/bin/env python</code> changed into <code>#!/usr/bin/env python2.6</code>, it is OK. </p>

<p>However, if we have a lot files with <code>#!/usr/bin/env python</code>, and we have multiple type of python (say <code>python</code> --> <code>python2.4</code> and <code>python26</code> --> <code>python2.6</code>) and moreover we want to keep the file as orginal as possible.</p>

<p>I tried to make <code>alias python='/usr/bin/python26</code>, but failed.</p>
