<h3>Question (ID-943242):</h3><h2>Benefit of installing Django from .deb versus .tar.gz?</h2><p>I'm starting Django development, and I can either install it from the .deb using</p>

<pre><code>$ apt-get install python-django
</code></pre>

<p>on my Ubuntu machine, or I can download the .tar.gz from <a href="http://djangoproject.com" rel="nofollow">djangoproject.com</a>, and start with that.</p>

<p>What are the benefits and drawbacks of each approach?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Using <code>apt-get</code> lets your system keep track of the install (e.g. if you want to disinstall, upgrade, or the like, late). Installing from source (<code>.tar.gz</code> or otherwise) puts you in charge of what's what and where -- you can have multiple versions installed at various locations, etc, but there's no easy "uninstall" and the like. Personally I prefer to install by my OS's supported method (<code>apt-get</code> and the like) for packages I think as secondary or auxiliary, directly from svn/hg/&amp;c for ones I'm contributing to or otherwise want to keep the closest control on, and <code>.tar.gz</code> (or better when available <code>.tar.bz2</code>;-) "snapshots" and "source releases" that are s/where in the middle...</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The best way to install is to check out the code, which ever the changeset (branch/tag) you want, and define a symbolic link to it</p>

<p>Checkout the version you want:</p>

<pre><code># For trunk
svn co http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk/ django-trunk   
# For a tag, 1.02 release
svn co http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/tag/1.02 django-1.02
# To update the trunk
cd django-trunk
svn up
</code></pre>

<p>Then define symbolic link</p>

<pre><code>ln -fs /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/django/* ~/django-1.02/
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to test your code in the latest release, just redefine the symbolic link:</p>

<pre><code>ln -fs /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/django/* ~/django-trunk/
</code></pre>

<p>The package managers aptitude and apt-get are good for auto updating those software you don't really bother about developing with every day, like media players, browsers. For stuff U code with everyday, full control of versions is needed, you get that only by source.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Using apt-get you'll get better uninstall support via the package manager and it can also install dependencies for you.  If you install with apt-get you might get automatic updates, which is very nice for security patches.</p>

<p>With the tar you might get a newer version and you might get the opportunity to tailor the compile flags.  A build could be more optimized for your particular processor, but since it's python that doesn't matter in this case.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Getting Django from your Ubuntu repository gives you the older "stable" version. This may be fine with you, but I believe most developers prefer sticking with latest code available in the trunk to get more features.</p>

<p>IMHO the cleanest solution is not to install .tar.gz/SVN version with straightforward <code>sudo python setup.py install</code> (or use <code>easy-install</code>) but to make a .deb package. This way you should get the maximum benefits: 1) all the bleeding edge features you want 2) proper Debian/Ubuntu package, which you may easily uninstall, upgrade and deploy to any number of Debian machines.</p>

<p>Here's a quick and dirty way how to do it:</p>

<pre><code>#
# This is dirty (you have been warned) way to quickly
# make new Django .deb package from SVN trunk for personal use.
#
apt-get source python-django
apt-get build-dep python-django
svn co http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk/ django-trunk
DJANGO_SVN_REVISION=`LC_ALL=C svn info django-trunk \
                     | grep ^Revision: | awk '{ print $2 }'`
cp -R python-django-*/debian django-trunk/
cd django-trunk
dch --newversion=1.1-1ubuntu1~svn${DJANGO_SVN_REVISION} \
    "Non-maintainer quick-and-dirty update to SVN r${DJANGO_SVN_REVISION}"
dpkg-buildpackage
# Have a good sip of tea, coffee or whatever you prefer.
# Because of tests, this is going to take quite a while.
# You may consider disabling (this is bad!) tests by commenting out
# line mentioning "runtests.py" in debian/rules.
cd ..
dpkg -i python-django_*.deb
</code></pre>

<p>This is not even really guarranteed to work (and I'm not really sure even about proper package version naming), but I've tried it myself and it worked for me.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I've always installed using the dev version. <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/install/#installing-development-version" rel="nofollow">(Instructions)</a></p>

<p>This makes updating really easy and gives you all the fancy features in the /dev/ docs. I would suggest you try going this route if possible (if anything it gives you an idea of how site-packages work).</p>

<p>Note: ubuntu 9.04's recent move to dist-packages from site-packages (8.04) made this a bit confusing, had to recreate the link.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I know with debian and probably some other distros, the version of django in the package manager is the 0.9 branch, not the 1.X branch. Definately something you want to avoid.</p>
