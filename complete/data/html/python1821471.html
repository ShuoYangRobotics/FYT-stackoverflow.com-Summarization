<h3>Question (ID-1821471):</h3><h2>Python: Nested Loop</h2><p>Consider this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [("one","two"), ("bad","good")]

&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in a:
...     for x in i:
...         print x
... 
one
two
bad
good
</code></pre>

<p>How can I write this code, but using a syntax like:</p>

<pre><code>for i in a:
    print [x for x in i]
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, This does not work, it prints:</p>

<pre><code>['one', 'two']
['bad', 'good']
</code></pre>

<p>I want the same output. Can it be done?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>List comprehensions and generators are only designed to be used as expressions, while printing is a statement.  While you can effect what you're trying to do by doing</p>

<pre><code>from __future__ import print_function
for x in a:
    [print(each) for each in x]
</code></pre>

<p>doing so is amazingly unpythonic, and results in the generation of a list that you don't actually need.  The best thing you could do would simply be to write the nested <code>for</code> loops in your original example.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Given your example you could do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>a = [("one","two"), ("bad","good")]

for x in sum(map(list, a), []):
    print x
</code></pre>

<p>This can, however, become quite slow once the list gets big.</p>

<p>The better way to do it would be like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/20670/tim-pietzcker">Tim Pietzcker</a> suggested:</p>

<pre><code>from itertools import chain

for x in chain(*a):
    print x
</code></pre>

<p>Using the <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/controlflow.html#tut-unpacking-arguments" rel="nofollow">star notation</a>, <code>*a</code>, allows you to have n tuples in your list.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><pre><code>import itertools
for item in itertools.chain(("one","two"), ("bad","good")):
    print item
</code></pre>

<p>will produce the desired output with just one <code>for</code> loop.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The print function really is superior, but here is a much more pythonic suggestion inspired by Benjamin Pollack's answer:</p>

<pre><code>from __future__ import print_function
for x in a:
    print(*x, sep="\n")
</code></pre>

<p>Simply use <code>*</code> to unpack the list x as arguments to the function, and use newline separators.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [("one","two"), ("bad","good")]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print "\n".join(j for i in a for j in i)
one
two
bad
good



&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in a:
...  print "\n".join(i)
... 
one
two
bad
good
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You'll need to define your own print method (or import <code>__future__.print_function</code>)</p>

<pre><code>def pp(x): print x

for i in a:
  _ = [pp(x) for x in i]
</code></pre>

<p>Note the <code>_</code> is used to indicate that the returned list is to be ignored.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>This code is straightforward and simpler than other solutions here:</p>

<pre><code>for i in a:
    print '\n'.join([x for x in i])
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Not the best, but:</p>

<pre><code>for i in a:
    some_function([x for x in i])

def some_function(args):
    for o in args:
        print o
</code></pre>
