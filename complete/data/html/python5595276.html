<h3>Question (ID-5595276):</h3><h2>PyDev Eclipse Python interpreters Error: stdlib not found</h2><p>I have been trying to use Eclipse 3.6 as a Python editor. 
I install the latest version of PyDev, and then try to set the Interpreter - Python field of the preferences, on my mac.</p>

<p>My python version is 2.6 and the path is "/usr/bin/python". When I enter this, and I select the items to add to the system PYTHONPATH I get the following error message below.</p>

<p>So I can't tell eclipse the interpreter path! 
Any help would be great! 
(I tried reinstalling PyDev already, no luck)</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>"Error: Python stdlib not found</p>

<p>It seems that the Python /Lib folder (which contains the standard library) was not found /selected during the instal process.</p>

<p>This folder (which contains files such as threading.py and traceback.py) is required for PyDev to function properly (and it must contain the actual source files, not only .pyc files) 
..."</p>

<p>Following Praveen's answer, My python library is in /library/python/2.6/site-packages. When I enter /usr/bin/python into the interpreter field, eclipse asks me which paths I would like to add to my System PYTHONPATH. One of the checkbox items is exactly that path. So I check it, along with the other boxes. Click ok, and I get the same error.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Had the same problem.  Eclipse wouldn't find all the required path using the default installed python (2.6).  I downloaded python 2.7, went through the install.  My new "which python" path became:</p>

<p>/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python.</p>

<p>When I tried to set up the interpreter this time, specified this path and it went right through.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<ol>
<li>Browse to <code>/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin</code> directory</li>
<li>Select the python interpreter that's installed. Sometimes the 'python' link doesn't exist to the current interpreter (say, python3)</li>
</ol>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>just found an answer to my own question, thought it might enlighten other users with similar problems. I will try it out later to see if it works.</p>

<p>"I downloaded the Python source release and simply dropped the /Lib folder into the /System/..../Frameworks/.../lib/python2.6/ and it works."</p>

<p>"That's a solution (although usually what I do on Mac OS is getting a python install from python.org instead of using the default one -- not sure what you may break in Mac OS if something bad happens there while developing)."</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>PyDev needs the location of the python lib folder to get this directory location on your computer try running this  command in the terminal.</p>

<pre><code>python -c "from distutils.sysconfig import get_python_lib; print get_python_lib()"
</code></pre>

<p>And add that directory to your PYTHONPATH location in PyDev in Eclipse.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I too had the error: stdlib sources not found.</p>

<p>My fix was to install XCode 4.2 and then retry Eclipse's PyDev "Auto Config" method.</p>

<p>No error.  PyDev running OK!</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I found the solution of not touching macs deliverd python version, but downloading ad installing a new one (currently 3.something) </p>

<p>when setting up the interpreter, point to /usr/local/bin/pyhton3</p>

<p>(to find out the exact path open terminal and type: sudo -s !hittenter> your password  !hittenter>   cd /usr/local/bin  !hittenter>  ls  !hittenter>)
-> what this does is, showing you the content of the folder you went to. you should find the python interpreter in there.</p>

<p>WARNING!!!!
Do not touch or change any other python files/folders delivered with your mac.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>After installing Apple's OSX Developer tools from <a href="http://developer.apple.com/xcode/" rel="nofollow">http://developer.apple.com/xcode/</a>, the necessary .py files will be installed in /library/python/2.6/site-packages. No need to fuss with installing python yourself of using versions of Python not blessed by Apple.</p>
