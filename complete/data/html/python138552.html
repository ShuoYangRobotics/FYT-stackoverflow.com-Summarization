<h3>Question (ID-138552):</h3><h2>Can Regex be used for this particular string manipulation?</h2><p>I need to replace character (say) <strong>x</strong> with character (say) <strong>P</strong> in a string, but only if it is contained in a quoted substring.
An example makes it clearer:</p>

<pre><code>axbx'cxdxe'fxgh'ixj'k  -&gt; axbx'cPdPe'fxgh'iPj'k
</code></pre>

<p>Let's assume, for the sake of simplicity, that quotes always come in pairs. </p>

<p>The obvious way is to just process the string one character at a time (a simple state machine approach);<br />
however, I'm wondering if regular expressions can be used to do all the processing in one go.</p>

<p>My target language is C#, but I guess my question pertains to any language having builtin or library support for regular expressions.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-9):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I was able to do this with Python:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import re
&gt;&gt;&gt; re.sub(r"x(?=[^']*'([^']|'[^']*')*$)", "P", "axbx'cxdxe'fxgh'ixj'k")
"axbx'cPdPe'fxgh'iPj'k"
</code></pre>

<p>What this does is use the non-capturing match (?=...) to check that the character x is within a quoted string. It looks for some nonquote characters up to the next quote, then looks for a sequence of either single characters or quoted groups of characters, until the end of the string.</p>

<p>This relies on your assumption that the quotes are always balanced. This is also not very efficient.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I converted Greg Hewgill's python code to C# and it worked!</p>

<pre><code>[Test]
public void ReplaceTextInQuotes()
{
  Assert.AreEqual("axbx'cPdPe'fxgh'iPj'k", 
    Regex.Replace("axbx'cxdxe'fxgh'ixj'k",
      @"x(?=[^']*'([^']|'[^']*')*$)", "P"));
}
</code></pre>

<p>That test passed.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Not with plain regexp. Regular expressions have no "memory" so they cannot distinguish between being "inside" or "outside" quotes. </p>

<p>You need something more powerful, for example using <a href="http://gema.sourceforge.net" rel="nofollow">gema</a> it would be straighforward:</p>

<pre><code>'&lt;repl&gt;'=$0
repl:x=P
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The trick is to use non-capturing group to match the part of the string <em>following</em> the match (character <strong>x</strong>) we are searching for.
Trying to match the string up to <strong>x</strong> will only find either the first or the last occurence, depending whether non-greedy quantifiers are used.
Here's Greg's idea transposed to Tcl, with comments.</p>

<pre>
set strIn {axbx'cxdxe'fxgh'ixj'k}
set regex {(?x)                     # enable expanded syntax 
                                    # - allows comments, ignores whitespace
            x                       # the actual match
            (?=                     # non-matching group
                [^']*'              # match to end of current quoted substring
                                    ##
                                    ## assuming quotes are in pairs,
                                    ## make sure we actually were 
                                    ## inside a quoted substring
                                    ## by making sure the rest of the string 
                                    ## is what we expect it to be
                                    ##
                (
                    [^']*           # match any non-quoted substring
                    |               # ...or...
                    '[^']*'         # any quoted substring, including the quotes
                )*                  # any number of times
                $                   # until we run out of string :)
            )                       # end of non-matching group
}

#the same regular expression without the comments
set regexCondensed {(?x)x(?=[^']*'([^']|'[^']*')*$)}

set replRegex {P}
set nMatches [regsub -all -- $regex $strIn $replRegex strOut]
puts "$nMatches replacements. "
if {$nMatches > 0} {
    puts "Original: |$strIn|"
    puts "Result:   |$strOut|"
}
exit
</pre>

<p>This prints:</p>

<pre><code>3 replacements. 
Original: |axbx'cxdxe'fxgh'ixj'k|
Result:   |axbx'cPdPe'fxgh'iPj'k|
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>A more general (and simpler) solution which allows non-paired quotes.</p>

<ol>
<li>Find quoted string</li>
<li><p>Replace 'x' by 'P' in the string</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
import re


text = "axbx'cxdxe'fxgh'ixj'k"


s = re.sub("'.*?'", lambda m: re.sub("x", "P", m.group(0)), text)


print s == "axbx'cPdPe'fxgh'iPj'k", s
# -&gt;   True axbx'cPdPe'fxgh'iPj'k
</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Sorry to break your hopes, but you need a push-down automata to do that. There is more info here:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushdown_automaton" rel="nofollow">Pushdown Automaton</a></p>

<p>In short, Regular expressions, which are finite state machines can only read and has no memory while pushdown automaton has a stack and manipulating capabilities.</p>

<p>Edit: spelling...</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Similar discussion about balanced text replaces: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/133601/can-regular-expressions-be-used-to-match-nested-patterns#133771">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/133601/can-regular-expressions-be-used-to-match-nested-patterns#133771</a></p>

<p>Although you can try this in Vim, but it works well only if the string is on one line, and there's only one pair of 's.</p>

<pre><code>:%s:\('[^']*\)x\([^']*'\):\1P\2:gci
</code></pre>

<p>If there's one more pair or even an unbalanced ', then it could fail. That's way I included the <code>c</code> a.k.a. confirm flag on the <code>ex</code> command.</p>

<p>The same can be done with sed, without the interaction - or with <code>awk</code> so you can add some interaction.</p>

<p>One possible solution is to break the lines on pairs of <code>'</code>s then you can do with vim solution. </p>

<ol>
<li><code>\G</code> &mdash; Anchor each match at the end of the previous one, or the start of the string.</li>
<li><code>(?:^[^']*'|(?&lt;=.))</code> &mdash; If it is at the beginning of the string, match up to the first quote.</li>
<li><code>(?:'[^']*'|[^'x]+)*+</code> &mdash; Match any block of unquoted characters, or any (non-quote) characters up to an 'x'.</li>

<p>One sweep trough the source string, except for a single character look-behind.</p>
