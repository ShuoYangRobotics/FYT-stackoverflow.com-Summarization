<h3>Question (ID-5293176):</h3><h2>python/clojure equivalent to mathematica's NestWhileList</h2><p>Impetus: I <em>was</em> looking for something in python which would get me </p>

<pre><code>f([1,2,3]) == [[1,2,3], [2,3], [3]]
</code></pre>

<p>In clojure, this would just be <code>(nest rest #(not (empty? %)) lst)</code>, or it would if we had a nest function. Do we? I'm tired of staring at the clojure api list..</p>

<p>Better approaches in python or clojure would also be appreciated..</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><pre><code>data = [1,2,3]
result = [ data[i:] for i in range(len(data)) ]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Return seqs:</p>

<pre><code>user&gt; (take-while seq (iterate rest [1 2 3]))
([1 2 3] (2 3) (3))
</code></pre>

<p>Return vectors:</p>

<pre><code>user&gt; (take-while seq (iterate #(subvec % 1) [1 2 3]))
([1 2 3] [2 3] [3])
</code></pre>

<p>I've seen this pattern packaged up into an <code>iterate-while</code> function, which is pretty much the same as your <code>nest</code> function:</p>

<pre><code>(defn iterate-while [pred f x]
  (take-while pred (iterate f x)))
</code></pre>

<p>Note that <code>(seq x)</code> is equivalent to, and preferred over, <code>(not (empty? x))</code></p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Maybe something like this (the first thing that came to my mind, and I haven't been doing clojure recently, so it might not be the best solution):</p>

<pre><code>(take-while identity (iterate next [1 2 3]))
</code></pre>

<p>Update:</p>

<p>This solution Justin suggested is preferable (shorter, <code>[]</code> input, etc.):</p>

<pre><code>(take-whil­e seq (iter­ate rest ...))
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><pre><code>user&gt; (reductions conj [] [1 2 3])
([] [1] [1 2] [1 2 3])
</code></pre>

<p>Gets you the empty version as well. If you want, you can instead do</p>

<pre><code>user&gt; (take-while identity (iterate next [1 2 3]))
([1 2 3] (2 3) (3))
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>user&gt; (rest (reductions conj [] [1 2 3]))
([1] [1 2] [1 2 3])
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><pre><code>(partition-all 3 1 [1 2 3])
</code></pre>

<p>yields </p>

<pre><code>((1 2 3) (2 3) (3))
</code></pre>

<p>if you want it in a vector format</p>

<pre><code>(vec (map vec (partition-all 3 1 [1 2 3])))
</code></pre>

<p>p.s. the 3 and the 1 in partition-all prior to the [1 2 3] define that the vector should be partitioned in groups of 3, with a stepsize of 1, and are not part of the input vector. I use partition-all instead of partition, because partition-all doesn't mind about groups being shorter than the specified length of 3.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Python:</p>

<pre><code>def f(l):
    while l:
        yield l[:]
        l.pop(0)
</code></pre>

<p>The copy (<code>[:]</code>) depends on whether you want a copy of the list or you are OK with modifying it in place. If you only need one of the sublists at a time, it may be faster to remove the copy and iterate over <code>f</code>.</p>

<p>Note also that a list is not the best data structure for this.</p>
