<h3>Question (ID-3561279):</h3><h2>Learn Python the Hard Way Exercise 17 Extra Question(S)</h2><p>I'm doing Zed Shaw's fantastic <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.com/" rel="nofollow">Learn Python The Hard Way</a>, but an extra question has me stumped: Line 9--10 could be written in one line, how? I've tried some different thoughts, but to no avail. I could move on, but what would the fun in that be?</p>

<pre><code>from sys import argv
from os.path import exists

script, from_file, to_file = argv

print "Copying from %s to %s" % (from_file, to_file)

# we could do these two on one line too, how?
input = open(from_file)
indata = input.read()

print "The input file is %d bytes long" % len(indata)

print "Does the output file exist? %r" % exists(to_file)
print "Ready, hit RETURN to continue, CTRL-C to abort."
raw_input()

output = open(to_file, 'w')
output.write(indata)

print "Alright, all done."
</code></pre>

<p>Zed also writes that he could do the whole script in one line. I'm not exactly sure what he means by that.</p>

<p>Feel free to help me however you want: by giving the answer or merely hinting---and perhaps including a collapsed or hidden answer to the question.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><a href="http://docs.python.org/library/shutil.html" rel="nofollow">shutil</a> is the way to do one-liner file copies in Python:</p>

<pre><code>shutil.copy(sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2])
</code></pre>

<p>Putting the <code>import shutil, sys</code> on the same line as this one (with a semicolon in-between, of course) would however be stylistically goofy;-).</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Well you can just do "algebraic substitution," right?  ...assuming you don't care about the "UI"...</p>

<pre><code>open(to_file, 'w').write(open(from_file).read())
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I agree with the algebraic substitution mentioned by @dash-tom-bang.
My functioning Exercise 17 extra credit has 5 lines. The operation is being conducted on one line.</p>

<p><strong>open(to_file, 'w').write(open(from_file).read())</strong></p>

<p>followed by a simple 'print' for verification feedback</p>

<p><strong>print "File %s copied to %s" % (from_file, to_file)</strong></p>

<p>I should have a 6th line that replaces the original ''output.close'' but I am confused about how to do this without the ''output'' variable? <em>Ahh, since I now have no output variable there is nothing to close.</em></p>

<p>btw- It is a little spooky for me to see the same exact line typed here that I have worked out and entered myself in gedit. Great stuff, I am really enjoying the mental challenge and community support. </p>

<p>Edit:answered my own question</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>try the following code:</p>

<pre><code>import shutil, sys; shutil.copy(sys.argv[0], sys.argv[2])
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><pre><code>from sys import argv
open(argv[2], 'w').write(open(argv[1]).read())
</code></pre>
