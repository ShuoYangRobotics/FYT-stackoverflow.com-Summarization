<h3>Question (ID-743806):</h3><h2>Split string into a list in Python</h2><p>I want my python function to split a sentence (input) and store each word in a list. The code that I've written so far splits the sentence, but does not store the words as a list. How do I do that?</p>

<pre><code>def split_line(text):

    # split the text
    words = text.split()

    # for each word in the line:
    for word in words:

        # prints each word on a line
        print(word)
</code></pre>

<p>this is your list</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>text.split() should be enough to store each word in a list.  words is already a list of the words from the sentence, so there is no need for the loop.  Second, it might be a typo, but
 you have your loop a little messed up.  If you really did want to use append, it would be </p>

<p><code>words.append(word)</code></p>

<p>not </p>

<p><code>word.append(words)</code></p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><a href="http://docs.python.org/library/string.html#string.split" rel="nofollow">string.split()</a> returns a list:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Return a <strong>list of the words</strong> of the string s. If the optional second argument sep is absent or None, the words are separated by arbitrary strings of whitespace characters (space, tab, newline, return, formfeed). </p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; line="a sentence with a few words"
&gt;&gt;&gt; line.split()
['a', 'sentence', 'with', 'a', 'few', 'words']
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>str().split()</code> method does this, it takes a string, splits it into a list:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; the_string = "this is a sentence"
&gt;&gt;&gt; words = the_string.split(" ")
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(words)
['this', 'is', 'a', 'sentence']
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(words)
&lt;type 'list'&gt; # or &lt;class 'list'&gt; in Python 3.0
</code></pre>

<p>The problem you're having is because of a typo, you wrote <code>print(words)</code> instead of <code>print(word)</code>:</p>

<p>Renaming the <code>word</code> variable to <code>current_word</code>, this is what you had:</p>

<pre><code>def split_line(text):
    words = text.split()
    for current_word in words:
        print(words)
</code></pre>

<p>..when you should have done:</p>

<pre><code>def split_line(text):
    words = text.split()
    for current_word in words:
        print(current_word)
</code></pre>

<p>If for some reason you want to manually construct a list in the for loop, you would use the list <code>append()</code> method, perhaps because you want to lower-case all words (for example):</p>

<pre><code>my_list = [] # make empty list
for current_word in words:
    my_list.append(current_word.lower())
</code></pre>

<p>Or more a bit neater, using a <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow">list-comprehension</a>:</p>

<pre><code>my_list = [current_word.lower() for current_word in words]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Depending on what you plan to do with your sentence-as-a-list, you may want to look at the <a href="http://www.nltk.org/" rel="nofollow">Natural Language Took Kit</a>.  It deals heavily with text processing and evaluation. You can also use it to solve your problem:</p>

<pre><code>import nltk
words = nltk.word_tokenize(raw_sentence)
</code></pre>

<p>This has the added benefit of splitting out punctuation.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import nltk
&gt;&gt;&gt; s = "The fox's foot grazed the sleeping dog, waking it."
&gt;&gt;&gt; words = nltk.word_tokenize(s)
&gt;&gt;&gt; words
['The', 'fox', "'s", 'foot', 'grazed', 'the', 'sleeping', 'dog', ',', 
'waking', 'it', '.']
</code></pre>

<p>This allows you to filter out any punctuation you don't want and use only words.  </p>

<p>Please note that the other solutions using <code>string.split()</code> are better if you don't plan on doing any complex manipulation of the sentance.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>i think u r confused because of a typo.<br />
replace print(words) with print(word) inside your loop to have every word printed on a different line</p>
