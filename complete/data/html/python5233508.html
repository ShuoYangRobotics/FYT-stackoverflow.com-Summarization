<h3>Question (ID-5233508):</h3><h2>What exactly is "lambda" in Python?</h2><p>I want to know what exactly is <code>lambda</code> in python? and where and why it is used.
thanks</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-9):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Lambda is more of a concept or programming technique then anything else. </p>

<p>Basically it's the idea that you get a function (a first-class object in python) returned as a result of another function instead of an object or primitive type. I know, it's confusing.</p>

<p>See this example from the <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/controlflow.html#lambda-forms" rel="nofollow">python documentation</a>: </p>

<pre><code>def make_incrementor(n):
  return lambda x: x + n
f = make_incrementor(42)
f(0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; 42
f(1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; 43
</code></pre>

<p>So make_incrementor creates a function that uses n in it's results. You could have a function that would increment a parameter by 2 like so: </p>

<pre><code>f2 = make_incrementor(2)
f2(3)
&gt;&gt;&gt; 5
</code></pre>

<p>This is a very powerful idea in functional programming and functional programming languages like lisp &amp; scheme. </p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Lambdas are not anonymous functions.  Lambdas are anonymous <em>expressions</em>.</p>

<p>They're accessed like functions, but they're not the same thing.  Functions allow complex tasks: flow control, variable declarations and lists of statements containing expressions.  Expressions are merely one part of a function, and that's what lambdas give you.  They're severely limited compared to functions.</p>

<p>Python does not support anonymous functions.  For examples of languages that do, see Javascript and Lua.</p>

<p>(Note: It's correct to call lambdas anonymous functions in functional languages, where the mathematical definition of "function" is used, but in procedural languages the word has a very different meaning than in mathematics.)</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><code>lambda</code> allows you define simple, unnamed functions inline with your code, e.g. as an argument. This is useful if you plan to use the function only once, and therefore don't want to clutter your code with a named function.</p>

<p>Let's say you have a list of numbers, and you want to get a list of the same length, with each number doubled. Rather than defining a <code>times_two</code> function, you could do something like this:</p>

<p><code>(map lambda x: x * 2, thelist)</code></p>

<p><code>lambda</code> also makes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying" rel="nofollow">Currying</a> more convenient.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Lambda functions are not a Python specific concept, but are a general programming term for anonymous function, i.e. functions without a name. In Python they are commonly used where you need to pass a simple function as a parameter to another function.</p>

<p>The <code>sort</code> method on lists takes a parameter <code>key</code> which is a function that is used to calculate the value the list is sorted on. Imagine you are sorting a list of two element tuples, and you want to sort the list based on the first element. You need to pass a function to <code>key</code> which returns the first element. You could do this:</p>

<pre><code>def first_element(x):
    return x[0]
my_list.sort(key=first_element)
</code></pre>

<p>or, much more concisely you can do:</p>

<pre><code>my_list.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>The <code>lambda</code> construct is a shorter way to define a simple function that calculates a single expression. The <code>def</code> statement can be inconvenient and make the code longer, broken up and harder to read through. The functions created by the two are virtually the same by the way they work, the difference is that <code>lambda</code> is limited to a single expression the value of which is returned and that <code>def</code> assigns a name to the function and adds it to the local variables by that same name. Also <code>lambda</code> can be used in an expression directly, while <code>def</code> is a statement.</p>

<pre><code>def f(x, y):
    return x + y
</code></pre>

<p>Would give you <em>almost</em> the same result as</p>

<pre><code>f = lambda x, y: x + y
</code></pre>

<p>And you can use it directly in an expression</p>

<pre><code>g(5, 6, helper=lambda x, y: x + y)
</code></pre>

<p>which with <code>def</code> would be less concise</p>

<pre><code>def helper_function(x + y):
    return x + y

g(5, 6, helper=helper_function)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p><code>lambda</code> is a way of defining an anonymous in-line function to accomplish some task versus defining it with the <code>def</code> keyword and calling it. Think of it as a shorthand you can use when you won't need to reuse a function. Anywhere you use lambda, you could substitute an explicitly called function: it's use is completely optional and left to the programmer as a matter of coding style.</p>

<p>Example code (without lambda):</p>

<pre><code>def numSquared(num):
    return num**2

for i in range(1,11):
    print numSquared(i)
</code></pre>

<p>Example code (with lambda):</p>

<pre><code>for i in range(1,11):
    print (lambda x: x**2)(i)
</code></pre>

<p>A good beginner's discussion of <code>lambda</code>:
<a href="http://diveintopython.org/power_of_introspection/lambda_functions.html" rel="nofollow" title="DiveIntoPython - Lambda">DiveIntPython.org - Lambda</a></p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>The first linked returned by googling "python lambda" points to a <a href="http://www.secnetix.de/olli/Python/lambda_functions.hawk" rel="nofollow">page</a> whose first paragraphs answer your question. I could copy &amp; paste the content it, but I think it's unfair :)</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>It's an inline anonymous function.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p><code>lambda</code> is an anonymous function, usually used for something quick that needs computing.</p>

<p>Example (This is used in a LexYacc command parser):</p>

<p><code>assign_command = lambda dictionary, command: lambda command_function: dictionary.setdefault(command, command_function)</code></p>

<p>This is a decorator. Put before a command we'd have from the LexYacc parser:
<code>@assign_command(_command_handlers, 'COMMAND')</code></p>

<p>This essentially builds a python script from the LexYacc language defined.</p>

<p>Or, a bit simpler:</p>

<p>`x = lambda x: return x > 0 and x &amp; (x-1) == 0</p>
