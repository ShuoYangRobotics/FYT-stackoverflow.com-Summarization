<h3>Question (ID-156230):</h3><h2>Python Dependency Injection Framework</h2><p>Is there a framework equivalent to Guice (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-guice" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/google-guice</a>) for Python?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p><a href="http://springpython.webfactional.com" rel="nofollow">Spring Python</a> is an offshoot of the Java-based Spring Framework and Spring Security, targeted for Python. This project currently contains the following features:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html" rel="nofollow">Inversion Of Control (dependency injection)</a> - use either classic XML, or the python @Object decorator (similar to the Spring JavaConfig subproject) to wire things together. While the @Object format isn't identical to the Guice style (centralized wiring vs. wiring information in each class), it is a valuable way to wire your python app.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming" rel="nofollow">Aspect-oriented Programming</a> - apply interceptors in a horizontal programming paradigm (instead of vertical OOP inheritance) for things like transactions, security, and caching.</li>
<li>DatabaseTemplate - Reading from the database requires a monotonous cycle of opening cursors, reading rows, and closing cursors, along with exception handlers. With this template class, all you need is the SQL query and row-handling function. Spring Python does the rest.</li>
<li>Database Transactions - Wrapping multiple database calls with transactions can make your code hard to read. This module provides multiple ways to define transactions without making things complicated.</li>
<li>Security - Plugin security interceptors to lock down access to your methods, utilizing both authentication and domain authorization.</li>
<li>Remoting - It is easy to convert your local application into a distributed one. If you have already built your client and server pieces using the IoC container, then going from local to distributed is just a configuration change.</li>
<li>Samples - to help demonstrate various features of Spring Python, some sample applications have been created:
<ul>
<li>PetClinic - Spring Framework's sample web app has been rebuilt from the ground up using python web containers including: <a href="http://cherrypy.org/" rel="nofollow">CherryPy</a>. Go check it out for an example of how to use this framework. (NOTE: Other python web frameworks will be added to this list in the future).</li>
<li>Spring Wiki - Wikis are powerful ways to store and manage content, so we created a simple one as a demo!</li>
<li>Spring Bot - Use Spring Python to build a tiny bot to manage the IRC channel of your open source project.</li>
</ul></li>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>As an alternative to monkeypatching, I like DI. A nascent project such as <a href="http://code.google.com/p/snake-guice/" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/snake-guice/</a> may fit the bill.</p>

<p>Or see the blog post <a href="http://planet.open4free.org/tag/dependency%20injection/" rel="nofollow">Dependency Injection in Python</a> by Dennis Kempin (Aug '08).</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Besides that:</p>

</ol>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I haven't used it, but the <a href="http://springpython.webfactional.com/" rel="nofollow">Spring Python</a> framework is based on Spring and implements <a href="http://springpython.webfactional.com/reference/html/components.html" rel="nofollow">Inversion of Control</a>.</p>

<p>There also appears to be a Guice in Python project: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/snake-guice/" rel="nofollow">snake-guice</a></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>If you just want to do dependency injection in Python, you don't need a framework. Have a look at <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/413268-dependency-injection-the-python-way/" rel="nofollow">Dependency Injection the Python Way</a>. It's really quick and easy, and only c. 50 lines of code.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>There is a somewhat Guicey <a href="http://code.google.com/p/python-inject/" rel="nofollow">python-inject</a> project. It's quite active, and a LOT less code then Spring-python, but then again, I haven't found a reason to use it yet.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>If you prefer a really tiny solution there's a little function, it is just a dependency setter. </p>

<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Here is a small example for a dependency injection container that does constructor injection based on the constructor argument names:</p>
