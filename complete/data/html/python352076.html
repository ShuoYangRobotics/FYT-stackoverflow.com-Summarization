<h3>Question (ID-352076):</h3><h2>Most pythonic form for mapping a series of statements?</h2><p>This is something that has bugged me for some time. I learnt Haskell before I learnt Python, so I've always been fond of thinking of many computations as a mapping onto a list. This is beautifully expressed by a list comprehension (I'm giving the pythonic version here):</p>

<pre><code>result = [ f(x) for x in list ]
</code></pre>

<p>In many cases though, we want to execute more than a single statement on x, say:</p>

<pre><code>result = [ f(g(h(x))) for x in list ]
</code></pre>

<p>This very quickly gets clunky, and difficult to read.</p>

<p>My normal solution to this is to expand this back into a for loop:</p>

<pre><code>result = []
for x in list:
  x0 = h(x)
  x1 = g(x0)
  x2 = f(x1)
  result.append(x2)
</code></pre>

<p>One thing about this that bothers me no end is having to initialize the empty list 'result'. It's a triviality, but it makes me unhappy. I was wondering if there were any alternative equivalent forms. One way may be to use a local function(is that what they're called in Python?)</p>

<pre><code>def operation(x):
  x0 = h(x)
  x1 = g(x0)
  x2 = f(x1)
  return x2
result = [ operation(x) for x in list ]
</code></pre>

<p>Are there any particular advantages/disadvantages to either of the two forms above? Or is there perhaps a more elegant way?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You can easily do function composition in Python.  </p>

<p>Here's a demonstrates of a way to create a new function which is a composition of existing functions.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def comp( a, b ):
    def compose( args ):
    	return a( b( args ) )
    return compose

&gt;&gt;&gt; def times2(x): return x*2

&gt;&gt;&gt; def plus1(x): return x+1

&gt;&gt;&gt; comp( times2, plus1 )(32)
66
</code></pre>

<p>Here's a more complete recipe for <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/52902/" rel="nofollow">function composition</a>.  This should make it look less clunky.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Follow the style that most matches your tastes.<br>
I would not worry about performance; only in case you really see some issue you can try to move to a different style.</p>

<p>Here some other possible suggestions, in addition to your proposals:</p>

<pre><code>result = [f(
              g(
                h(x)
                )
              )
            for x in list]
</code></pre>

<p>Use progressive list comprehensions:</p>

<pre><code>result = [h(x) for x in list]
result = [g(x) for x in result]
result = [f(x) for x in result]
</code></pre>

<p>Again, that's only a matter of style and taste. Pick the one you prefer most, and stick with it :-)</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If this is something you're doing often and with several different statements you could write something like</p>

<pre><code>def seriesoffncs(fncs,x):
    for f in fncs[::-1]:
        x=f(x)
    return x
</code></pre>

<p>where fncs is a list of functions.  so seriesoffncs((f,g,h),x) would return 
f(g(h(x))).
This way if you later in your code need to workout h(q(g(f(x)))) you would simply do seriesoffncs((h,q,g,f),x) rather than make a new operations function for each combination of functions.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>If your only concerned with the last result, your last answer is the best.  It's clear for anyone looking at it what your doing.  </p>

<p>I often take any code that starts to get complex and move it to a function.  This basically serves as a comment for that block of code. (any complex code probably needs a re-write anyway, and putting it in a function I can go back and work on it later)</p>

<pre><code>def operation(x):
  x0 = h(x)
  x1 = g(x0)
  x2 = f(x1)
  return x2
result = [ operation(x) for x in list]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>A variation of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/352076/most-pythonic-form-for-mapping-a-series-of-statements#353147">dagw.myopenid.com</a>'s function:</p>

<pre><code>def chained_apply(*args):
    val = args[-1]
    for f in fncs[:-1:-1]:
        val=f(val)
    return val
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of seriesoffncs((h,q,g,f),x) now you can call:</p>

<pre><code>result = chained_apply(foo, bar, baz, x)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>As far as I know there's no built-in/native syntax for composition in Python, but you can write your own function to compose stuff without too much trouble.</p>

<pre><code>def compose(*f):
    return f[0] if len(f) == 1 else lambda *args: f[0](compose(*f[1:])(*args))

def f(x): 
    return 'o ' + str(x)

def g(x): 
    return 'hai ' + str(x)

def h(x, y): 
    return 'there ' + str(x) + str(y) + '\n'

action = compose(f, g, h)
print [action("Test ", item) for item in [1, 2, 3]]
</code></pre>

<p>Composing outside the comprehension isn't required, of course.</p>

<pre><code>print [compose(f, g, h)("Test ", item) for item in [1, 2, 3]]
</code></pre>

<p>This way of composing will work for any number of functions (well, up to the recursion limit) with any number of parameters for the inner function.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>There are cases where it's best to go back to the for-loop, yes, but more often I prefer one of these approaches:</p>

<p>Use appropriate line breaks and indentation to keep it readable:</p>

<pre><code>result = [blah(blah(blah(x)))
          for x in list]
</code></pre>

<p>Or extract (enough of) the logic into another function, as you mention. But not necessarily local; Python programmers prefer flat to nested structure, if you can see a reasonable way of factoring the functionality out.</p>

<p>I came to Python from the functional-programming world, too, and share your prejudice.</p>
