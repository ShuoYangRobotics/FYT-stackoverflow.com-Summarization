<h3>Question (ID-8073561):</h3><h2>how to make an exacutable to use in a shell - python</h2><p>I have a Python script and I was wondering how I can make it executable; in other words how can I run it by using a shell like bash.</p>

<p>I know the first thing is to stick on the first line <code>#! /usr/bin/env python</code> but then do I need for example the functions to be in a specific order (i.e., the main one at the top or the bottom). What's more do I need to keep the extension .py for my python file (can I just call the function <code>Dosomething</code>?). </p>

<p>To be short, could you provide a simple guide, the important points someone has to take into account to make a Python file executable?</p>

<p>Cheers</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>This is how I make an executable script.  It doesn't take <code>eggs</code> or anything like that into account.  It's just a simple script that I want to be able to execute.  I'm assuming you are using linux.</p>

<pre><code>#! /usr/bin/env python
import sys


def main():
    #
    # Do something ... Whatever processing you need to do, make it happen here.
    # Don't shove everything into main, break it up into testable functions!
    #
    # Whatever this function returns, is what the exit code of the interpreter,
    # i.e. your script, will be.  Because main is called by sys.exit(), it will
    # behave differently depending on what you return.
    # 
    # So, if you return None, 0 is returned.  If you return integer, that 
    # return code is used.  Anything else is printed to the console and 1 (error) 
    # is returned.
    #
    if an_error_occurred:
        return 'I\'m returning a string, it will be printed and 1 returned'

    # Otherwise 0, success is returned.
    return 0

# This is true if the script is run by the interpreter, not imported by another
# module.
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # main should return 0 for success, something else (usually 1) for error.
    sys.exit(main())
</code></pre>

<p>Now, if you're permissions are set correctly, you can execute this script.</p>

<p>One thing to realize is as your script is processed each line is executed in the interpreter.  This is true, regardless of how the processor "gets it".  That is importing a  script as a module and executing it as a script essentially both work the same, in that they both execute each line of the module.</p>

<p>Once you realize your script is simply executing as it runs, you realize that the order of functions don't matter.  A function declaration is a function declaration.  It's when you <strong><em>call</em></strong> the function that matters.</p>

<p>So, in general, the layout of your script looks like this</p>

<pre><code>def func1():
    pass
def func2():
    pass
def main():
    return 0

if __name__ == '__main__':
    sys.exit(main())
</code></pre>

<p>You create the functions you want to use first, then you use them.  Hope it helps.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The only thing (like you said it) is to include:</p>

<pre><code>#! /bin/env python
</code></pre>

<p>on the first line. And is not even mandatory, but recommended.
After that, you can just call it writing:</p>

<pre><code>python [filename].py
</code></pre>

<p>in a terminal or in a bash file.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You'll also have to give it execution rights:</p>

<pre><code>chmod u+x yourfile.py
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Delete the first space. That is,</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
</code></pre>

<p>Should be the very first line of your file. Then, make sure you make set the permisions for the the file to executable with:</p>

<pre><code>chmod u+x your_script.py
</code></pre>

<p>Python scripts execute in sequential order. If you have a file filled with functions, common practice is to have something that looks like this at the very end of your file:</p>

<pre><code>if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</code></pre>

<p>Where main() starts execution of your script. The reason we do it this way, instead of a bare call to main() is that this allows you to make your script act like a module without any modification; if you just had a single line that called main(), your module would would execute the script's main. The if statement just checks if your script is running in the __main__ namespace, i.e., it is running as a script.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You need to add <em>sha bang</em> as you described, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
</code></pre>

<p>as the first line in your file and you need to make it executable by running</p>

<pre><code>chmod +x Dosomething
</code></pre>

<p>You do not need to do anything else, in particular file name may be anything including <code>Dosomething</code>. Your <code>PATH</code> probably doesn't include the directory where the file resides, so you should run it like this (assuming your current working directory is where the file is):</p>

<pre><code>./Dosomething
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Your code should follow the template</p>

<pre><code># any functions I want to define, and will be accessible when imported as module  
# or run from command line
...

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # things I want to do only when I run it from the command line
    ...  
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to be able to run it without having to use <code>python fileName.py</code> but rather just <code>./fileName.py</code> then you will want to make the first line of your file</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
</code></pre>

<p>And make the file executable by the user at least</p>

<pre><code>chmod u+x fileName.py
</code></pre>

<p>If you do not add a .py extension to your file then it will still be runnable from the command line ... but not importable by other modules.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><ol>
<li>Place <code>#!/usr/bin/python</code> in the first line</li>
<li>You can name your python script anything, like: <code>myPythonScript</code> (No, you do not need to keep .py extension)</li>
<li><code>chmod +x myPythonScript</code></li>
<li>Run it: <code>./myPythonScript</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Example: myPythonScript</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python
print "hello, world!"
</code></pre>
