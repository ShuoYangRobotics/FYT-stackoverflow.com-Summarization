<h3>Question (ID-3481554):</h3><h2>if loop: x not in VS not x in</h2><p>This is a strange question but here goes:</p>

<p>I've noticed that both of these work the same:</p>

<p><code>if x not in list</code> and <code>if not x in list</code>. </p>

<p>Is there some sort of difference between the two in certain cases? Is there a reason for having both, or is it just because it's more natural for some people to write one or the other. </p>

<p>Which one am I more likely to see in other people's code?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p><code>not x in L</code> isn't explicitly disallowed because that would be silly. <code>x not in L</code> is explicitly allowed (though it compiles to the same bytecode) because it's more readable.</p>

<p><code>x not in L</code> is what everyone uses, though.</p>

<p>when you do "not a in b" it will need be converted for (not in)</p>

<p>so, the right way is "a not in b".</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>The two forms make identical bytecode, as you can clearly verify:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import dis
&gt;&gt;&gt; dis.dis(compile('if x not in d: pass', '', 'exec'))
  1           0 LOAD_NAME                0 (x)
              3 LOAD_NAME                1 (d)
              6 COMPARE_OP               7 (not in)
              9 JUMP_IF_FALSE            4 (to 16)
             12 POP_TOP             
             13 JUMP_FORWARD             1 (to 17)
        &gt;&gt;   16 POP_TOP             
        &gt;&gt;   17 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)
             20 RETURN_VALUE        
&gt;&gt;&gt; dis.dis(compile('if not x in d: pass', '', 'exec'))
  1           0 LOAD_NAME                0 (x)
              3 LOAD_NAME                1 (d)
              6 COMPARE_OP               7 (not in)
              9 JUMP_IF_FALSE            4 (to 16)
             12 POP_TOP             
             13 JUMP_FORWARD             1 (to 17)
        &gt;&gt;   16 POP_TOP             
        &gt;&gt;   17 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)
             20 RETURN_VALUE        
</code></pre>

<p>so obviously they're semantically identical.</p>

<p>As a matter of style, <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow">PEP 8</a> does not mention the issue.</p>

<p>Personally, I strongly prefer the <code>if x not in y</code> form -- that makes it immediately clear that <code>not in</code> is a single operator, <strong>and</strong> "reads like English".  <code>if not x in y</code> may mislead some readers into thinking it means <code>if (not x) in y</code>, reads a bit less like English, and has absolutely no compensating advantages.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>It just personal preference.  You could also compare <code>if x != 3</code> and <code>if not x == 3</code>.  There's no difference between the two expressions you've shown.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>When you write <code>a not in b</code> it is using the <code>not in</code> operator, whereas <code>not a in b</code> uses the <code>in</code> operator and then negates the result. But the <code>not in</code> operator is defined to return the same as <code>not a in b</code> so they do exactly the same thing. From the <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/expressions.html#notin" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The operators <code>in</code> and <code>not in</code> test for collection membership. <code>x in s</code> evaluates to true if <code>x</code> is a member of the collection <code>s</code>, and false otherwise. <code>x not in s</code> returns the negation of <code>x in s</code>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Similarly there is <code>a is not b</code> versus <code>not a is b</code>.</p>

<p>The extra syntax was added because it makes it easier for a human to read it naturally.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Same. No difference whatsoever</p>
