<h3>Question (ID-1788432):</h3><h2>How to have a URL like this in Django?</h2><p>How can I have URLs like <code>example.com/category/catename-operation/</code> in Django?</p>

<p>Also in some cases the user enters a space separated category, how can I handle that?
E.g if the user enters the category as "my home", then the URL for this category will become 
<code>example.com/my home/</code> which is not a valid URL.</p>

<p>How can I handle these things?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>If you want to keep your URLs pretty, for example when a user enters "my category" you could have "my-category" instead of "my%20category" in the URL. I suggest you look into SlugField (<a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/fields/#slugfield" rel="nofollow">http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/fields/#slugfield</a>) and prepopulating that slugfield using ModelAdmin's prepopulated_fields attribute.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><code>http://example.com/my%20home/</code> is a valid URL where space character is escaped and Django will do all escaping/unescaping for you.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You could consider adding a URL-friendly name to your category and using that in the URL instead.</p>

<p>As another example you could have <code>example.com/tv/</code> and have the category called "Televisions."</p>

<p>If you want to handle this thing, to obtain my-url, then use the form field clean method to return the valid url. Thats what it is meant for.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You can use the slugify template tag within your views to deal with spaces and such like so:</p>

<pre><code>from django.template.defaultfilters import slugify
slugify("This is a slug!") # Will return u'this-is-a-slug'
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You can try an improved version of SlugField called AutoSlugField which is part of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-command-extensions/" rel="nofollow">Django Custom Management Command Extensions</a>.</p>
