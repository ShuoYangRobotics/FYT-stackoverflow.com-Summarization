<h3>Question (ID-1837686):</h3><h2>Compressing UTF-8(or other 8-bit encoding) to 7 or fewer bits</h2><p>I wish to take a file encoded in UTF-8 that doesn't use more than 128 different characters, then move it to a 7-bit encoding to save the 1/8 of space. For example, if I have a 16 MB text file that only uses the first 128(ascii) characters, I would like to shave off the extra bit to reduce the file to 14MB.</p>

<p>How would I go about doing this?</p>

<p>There doesn't seem to be an existing free or proprietary program to do so, so I was thinking I might try and make a simple(if inefficient) one.</p>

<p>The basic idea I have is to make a function from the current hex/decimal/binary values used for each character to the 128 values I would have in the seven bit encoding, then scan through the file and write each modified value to a new file.</p>

<p>So if the file looked like(I'll use a decimal example because I try not to have to think in hex)</p>

<p>127 254 025 212 015 015 132...
It would become</p>

<p>001 002 003 004 005 005 006</p>

<p>If 127 mapped to 001, 254 mapped to 005, etc.</p>

<p>I'm not entirely sure on a couple things, though.</p>

<ol>
<li>Would this be enough to actually shorten the filesize? I have a bad feeling this would simply leave an extra 0 on the binary string--11011001 might get mapped to 01000001 rather than 1000001, and I won't actually save space.
If this would happen, how do I get rid of the zero?</li>
<li>How do I open the file to read/write in binary/decimal/hex rather than just text?
I've mostly worked with Python, but I can muddle through C if I must.</li>
</ol>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Do you understand that files are divided into bytes? Thus, if you did that, you'd have 7 bits of the first letter in bytes 1, plus 1 bit of the second letter, then in byte two, you'd have 6 bits of the second letter, and 2 bits of the third, so on. It would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>|AAAAAAAB|BBBBBBCC|CCCCCDDD|DDDDEEEE|EEEFFFFF|FF...
 \------/ \------/ \------/ \------/ \------/
   byte     byte     byte     byte     byte
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Your idea is on the right track, but needs some development. If you're interested in this kind of data compression, you may want to investigate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman%5Fcoding" rel="nofollow">Huffman coding</a>. This is a simple data compression technique that is used in many real-world situations.</p>

<p>I can recommend <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1558514341" rel="nofollow">The Data Compression Book</a> by Mark Nelson which is a great introduction to data compression techniques.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Your idea is unlikely to work. If you write the byte 0x05 into a file, the byte gets written, all 8 bits of it - with leading zeros. To actually accomplish what you need, you can encode each 8 bytes in 7 bytes (since you only need 8*7 bits to encode 8 values). One approach is keep the 7 values in the 7 low bits of their bytes, and spread the 8th byte over the 7 MSBits.</p>

<p>As for Python, opening a file in binary write mode is <code>open(filename, 'wb')</code>. You'll also have to learn about bit operations to pack bytes as described above.</p>

<p>Just a small example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 0x03
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = 0x59
&gt;&gt;&gt; c = ((a &amp; 0x1) &lt;&lt; 7) | b
&gt;&gt;&gt; hex(c)
'0xd9'
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This places the lowest bit of <code>a</code> into the MSBit of <code>c</code> and the rest of <code>c</code> is the value of <code>b</code>.</p>

<p>I'm sure you can take it from here.</p>

<p>Correct.  Your plan will do nothing.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>What you need is UTF-7.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> UTF-7 has the advantage of bloating "only" special characters, so if special characters are rare in the input, you get far less bytes than by just converting UTF-8 to 7 bit. That's what UTF-7 is for.</p>
