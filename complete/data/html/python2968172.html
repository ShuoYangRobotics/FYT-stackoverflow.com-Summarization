<h3>Question (ID-2968172):</h3><h2>How to share an array in Python with a C++ Program?</h2><p>I two programs running, one in Python and one in C++, and I need to share a two-dimensional array (just of decimal numbers) between them. I am currently looking into serialization, but <code>pickle</code> is python-specific, unfortunately. What is the best way to do this?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Edit: It is likely that the array will only have 50 elements or so, but the transfer of data will need to occur very frequently: 60x per second or more.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><em>You could try using <code>boost::python</code> to make your applications interoperable.</em></p>

<p>Some <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_43_0/libs/python/doc/v2/pickle.html" rel="nofollow">information</a> about <code>pickle</code> support and plain <code>boost::python</code> <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_43_0/libs/python/doc/index.html" rel="nofollow">documentation.</a></p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You could try hosting the array in a <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/mmap.html" rel="nofollow">Memory-mapped file</a>, although you will need to synchronize access to the file to avoid race conditions.</p>

<p>Alternatively you could establish a socket (or pipe) connection between both processes and pass values by exchanging messages.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Your case is handled very well by <a href="http://mathema.tician.de/software/pyublas" rel="nofollow">PyUblas</a>, a bridge between Numpy and Boost.Ublas using Boost.Python. This bridge supports copy-free transfer of vectors and matrices and is very easy to use.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>How large is this array? If it isn't very large, then JSON serialization is a good fit. There are <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsoncpp/" rel="nofollow">libraries</a> <a href="http://zoolib.cvs.sourceforge.net/zoolib/zoolib/src_other/misc/ZUtil_JSON.cpp" rel="nofollow">readily</a> <a href="http://ddsbench.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/ddsbench/trunk/jost/" rel="nofollow">available</a> for C++, and Python has JSON serialization <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/json.html" rel="nofollow">in its standard library</a> as of version 2.6. See <a href="http://www.json.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.json.org/</a> for more info.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I would propose simply to use c arrays(via ctypes on the python side) and simply pull/push the raw data through an socket</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Serialization is one problem while IPC is another.  Do you have the IPC portion figured out? (pipes, sockets, mmap, etc?)</p>

<p>On to serialization - if you're concerned about performance more than robustness (being able to plug more modules into this architecture) and security, then you should take a look at the <code>struct</code> module.  This will let you pack data into C structures using format strings to define the structure (takes care of padding, alignment, and byte ordering for you!) In the C++ program, cast a pointer to the buffer to the corresponding structure type. </p>

<p>This works well with a tightly-coupled Python script and C++ program that is only run internally.</p>
