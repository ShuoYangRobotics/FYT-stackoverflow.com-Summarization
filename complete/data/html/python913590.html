<h3>Question (ID-913590):</h3><h2>django error 'too many values to unpack'</h2><p>I'm learning Django by building a simple recipes app. I have a 1 table model using the 'choices' field option for recipe categories rather than using a 2nd 'categories' table and a foreign key relationship. So i created db table via syncdb and then loaded table with test data. When i go to admin and click on the 'Recipes' link in an attempt to view recipes i get the following error:</p>

<pre><code>Template error

In template /var/lib/python-support/python2.6/django/contrib/admin/templates/admin/change_list.html, error at line 34
Caught an exception while rendering: too many values to unpack
</code></pre>

<p>If anyone can shed light on this cryptic error that would be great. Db is Sqlite. Django version is 1.0. The model is listed below:</p>

<pre><code>from django.db import models

class Recipe(models.Model):
    CATEGORY_CHOICES = (
        (1, u'Appetizer'),
        (2, u'Bread'),
        (3, u'Dessert'),
        (4, u'Drinks'),
        (5, u'Main Course'),
        (6, u'Salad'),
        (7, u'Side Dish'),
        (8, u'Soup'),
        (9, u'Sauce/Marinade'),
        (10, u'Other'),        
    )
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    submitter = models.CharField(max_length=40)
    date = models.DateTimeField()
    category = models.SmallIntegerField(choices=CATEGORY_CHOICES)
    ingredients = models.TextField()
    directions = models.TextField()
    comments = models.TextField(null=True, blank=True)
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>If I had to guess, it's because whatever is in the administrative template expects a list of tuples, but you've instead supplied a tuple of tuples (hence the "too many values"). Try replacing with a list instead:</p>

<pre><code>CATEGORY_CHOICES = [    # Note square brackets.
    (1, u'Appetizer'),
    (2, u'Bread'),
    (3, u'Dessert'),
    (4, u'Drinks'),
    (5, u'Main Course'),
    (6, u'Salad'),
    (7, u'Side Dish'),
    (8, u'Soup'),
    (9, u'Sauce/Marinade'),
    (10, u'Other'),        
]

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Per <a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/972" rel="nofollow">http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/972</a> , you need to move the assignment <code>CATEGORY_CHOICES = ...</code> <em>outside</em> the <code>class</code> statement.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I have encountered what I believe is this same error, producing the message:</p>

<pre><code>Caught ValueError while rendering: too many values to unpack
</code></pre>

<p>My form class was as follows:</p>

<pre><code>class CalcForm(forms.Form):
    item = forms.ChoiceField(choices=(('17815', '17816')))
</code></pre>

<p>Note that my <code>choices</code> type here is a tuple containing a tuple. Django official documentation reads as follows for the <code>choices</code> arg:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An iterable (e.g., a list or tuple) of 2-tuples to use as choices for
  this field. This argument accepts the same formats as the choices
  argument to a model field.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>src: <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/ref/forms/fields/#django.forms.ChoiceField.choices" rel="nofollow">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/ref/forms/fields/#django.forms.ChoiceField.choices</a></p>

<p>And yet <strong>this problem went away after I changed it to a list of tuples:</strong></p>

<pre><code>class CalcForm(forms.Form):
    item = forms.ChoiceField(choices=[('17815', '17816')])
</code></pre>

<p>After getting this to work, I wondered if perhaps the parentheses of the outtermost tuple in my initial code were being interpreted as denoting order of ops or some such thing and so I tried the following in hopes that it might make my intentions more explicit to the parser:</p>

<pre><code>item = forms.ChoiceField(choices=(('17815', '17816'), ('123', '456')))
</code></pre>

<p>But that doesn't work either and produced the same error.</p>

<p>Lesson: bugs happen.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I got it working. Most of the 'too many values to unpack' errors that i came across while googling were Value Error types. My error was a Template Syntax type. To load my recipe table i had imported a csv file. I was thinking maybe there was a problem somewhere in the data that sqlite allowed on import. So i deleted all data and then added 2 recipes manually via django admin form. The list of recipes loaded after that.</p>

<p>thanks.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I just had the same problem... my cvs file came from ms excel and the date fields gotten the wrong format at saving time. I change the format to something like '2010-05-04 13:05:46.790454'  (excel gave me 5/5/2010  10:05:47) and voilaaaa no more 'too many values to unpackâ€™</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You should use a ChoiceField instead of SmallIntegerField</p>
