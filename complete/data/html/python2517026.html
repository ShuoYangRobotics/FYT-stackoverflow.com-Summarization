<h3>Question (ID-2517026):</h3><h2>Graph theory in python</h2><p>I was wondering how people deal with graph theory in python? How is a graph stored? Are there libraries for this?</p>

<p>For example how would I input a graph and then find its Chromatic polynomial? Or its girth? Or the number of unique spanning trees? How about problems that involve edge weight like salesman problems?</p>

<p>I don't need all of these answered, I'm just looking for a method or tool set that will be able to help me approach solve problems like this.</p>

<p>Thanks,
Dan</p>

<h3>Features</h3>

<p>Standard graph-theoretic and statistical physics functions<br>
Easy exchange of network algorithms between applications, disciplines, and platforms<br>
Many classic graphs and synthetic networks<br>
Nodes and edges can be "anything" (e.g. time-series, text, images, XML records)<br>
Exploits existing code from high-quality legacy software in C, C++, Fortran, etc.<br>
Open source (encourages community input)<br>
Unit-tested</p>

<h3>Additional benefits from Python</h3>

<p>Fast prototyping of new algorithms<br>
Easy to teach<br>
Multi-platform<br>
Allows easy access to almost any database  </p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You can also have a look at <a href="http://networkx.lanl.gov/" rel="nofollow">NetworkX</a> which has pretty advanced algorithms &amp; drawing capability for graphs !</p>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>There's also <a href="http://igraph.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">igraph</a>, which is a library primarily implemented in C (hence it is usually faster than pure Python solutions), with a higher level interface to Python. Therefore, you get the best of both worlds: the speed of a pure C solution and all the usual benefits (fast prototyping etc.) of Python.</p>

<p>An example with igraph:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from igraph import Graph
&gt;&gt;&gt; g = Graph.Famous("petersen")
&gt;&gt;&gt; g.girth()
5
</code></pre>

<p><em>Disclaimer</em>: I'm a co-developer of igraph, so I'm not totally impartial :)</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>There is a wonderful article <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/essays/graphs/" rel="nofollow">http://www.python.org/doc/essays/graphs/</a></p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I would like to shamelessly plug my own python graph library: <a href="http://graph-tool.skewed.de" rel="nofollow">graph-tool</a>.</p>

<p>It is very fast, since it is implemented in C++ with the Boost Graph Library, and it contains lots of algorithms and extensive documentation.</p>
