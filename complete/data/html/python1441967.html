<h3>Question (ID-1441967):</h3><h2>Python imaging alternatives</h2><p>I have python code that needs to do just a couple simple things to photographs: crop, resize, and overlay a watermark. I've used PIL, and the resample/resize results are TERRIBLE. I've used imagemagick, and the interface and commands were designed by packaging a cat in a box, and then repeatedly throwing it down a set of stairs at a keyboard.</p>

<p>I'm looking for something which is not PIL or Imagemagick that I can use with python to do simple, high-quality image transformations. For that matter, it doesn't even have to have python bindings if the command line interface is good.</p>

<p>Oh, and it needs to be relatively platform agnostic, our production servers are linux, but some of our devs develop on windows. It can't require the installation of a bunch of silly gui code to use as a library, either.</p>

<p>They shouldn't be, as long as you:</p>

<ol>
<li>use only Image.ANTIALIAS filtering for downscaling operations</li>
<li>use only Image.BICUBIC filtering for upscaling operations.</li>
<li>remember to convert to 'RGB' colour mode before the resize if you are using a paletted image</li>
<li>don't use .thumbnail(). it's crap</li>
<li>set the <code>quality=</code> level to something appropriate when saving JPEGs (the default is quite low)</li>
</ol>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>PIL can do good resizing.  Make sure your source image is in RGB mode, not palette colors, and try the different algorithm choices.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>While imagemagick seems to be the de facto open-source imaging library, possibly <a href="http://openil.sourceforge.net/features.php" rel="nofollow">DevIL</a> (cross platform, seems to do simple image operations) or <a href="http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/features.html" rel="nofollow">FreeImage</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Have you checked <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/" rel="nofollow">pypi</a>? A cursory search shows some image related tools there, I also discovered python-gd, no clue how useful it might be though.</p>

<p>I've never had any issues with PIL myself, but some kind of variety might be interesting.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>GIMP has a reasonable command-line interface, I think.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Take a look at some of these imaging libraries:</p>

<p>hxxp://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.croppingimagefield/0.1beta</p>

<p>hxxp://pypi.python.org/pypi/cropresize/0.1.1</p>

<p>hxxp://pypi.python.org/pypi/image_resize/1.0</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I'm unsure as to why Image.thumbnail is getting such flak.  In the present release that I'm running off of it does little more than figure out the desired size and resize the image in place.  As long as you're using the proper resample filter and convert to RGB first (as bobince says) thumbnail shouldn't be any different than resize. </p>

<p>Here's the actual source for the thumbnail method:</p>

<pre><code>def thumbnail(self, size, resample=NEAREST):
  # preserve aspect ratio
  x, y = self.size
  if x &gt; size[0]: y = max(y * size[0] / x, 1); x = size[0]
  if y &gt; size[1]: x = max(x * size[1] / y, 1); y = size[1]
  size = x, y

  if size == self.size:
      return

  self.draft(None, size)

  self.load()

  try:
      im = self.resize(size, resample)
  except ValueError:
      if resample != ANTIALIAS:
          raise
      im = self.resize(size, NEAREST) # fallback

  self.im = im.im
  self.mode = im.mode
  self.size = size

  self.readonly = 0
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Last time I compared, this downscaler's output is almost identical to that of GIMP's "cubic" option:</p>

<pre><code> import Image

 def stretch(im, size, filter=Image.NEAREST):
     im.load()
     im = im._new(im.im.stretch(size, filter))
     return im
</code></pre>

<p>IIRC, the differences are visually indistinguishable -- some pixel values +/-1 due to rounding, and they tend to be round the edges.  It's not slow either.</p>
