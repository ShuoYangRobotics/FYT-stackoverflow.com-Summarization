<h3>Question (ID-492519):</h3><h2>Timeout on a Python function call</h2><p>I'm calling a function in Python which I know may stall and force me to restart the script. How do I call the function or what do I wrap it in so that if it takes longer than 5 seconds the script cancels it and does something else.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<pre><code>In [1]: import signal

# Register an handler for the timeout
In [2]: def handler(signum, frame):
   ...:     print "Forever is over!"
   ...:     raise Exception("end of time")
   ...: 

# This function *may* run for an indetermined time...
In [3]: def loop_forever():
   ...:     import time
   ...:     while 1:
   ...:         print "sec"
   ...:         time.sleep(1)
   ...:         
   ...:         

# Register the signal function handler
In [4]: signal.signal(signal.SIGALRM, handler)
Out[4]: 0

# Define a timeout for your function
In [5]: signal.alarm(10)
Out[5]: 0

In [6]: try:
   ...:     loop_forever()
   ...: except Exception, exc: 
   ...:     print exc
   ....: 
sec
sec
sec
sec
sec
sec
sec
sec
Forever is over!
end of time

# Cancel the timer if the function returned before timeout
# (ok, mine won't but yours maybe will :)
In [7]: signal.alarm(0)
Out[7]: 0

<p>10 seconds after the call <code>alarm.alarm(10)</code>, the handler is called. This raises an exception that you can intercept from the regular Python code.</p>

<p>This module doesn't play well with threads (but then, who does?)</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I'm making some local xmlrpc calls with a timeout using the following code, borrowed from an ActiveState Cookbook <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/473878/" rel="nofollow">recipe</a>:</p>

<pre><code>def timeout(func, args=(), kwargs={}, timeout_duration=10, default=None):
    """This function will spawn a thread and run the given function
    using the args, kwargs and return the given default value if the
    timeout_duration is exceeded.
    """ 
    import threading
    class InterruptableThread(threading.Thread):
        def __init__(self):
            threading.Thread.__init__(self)
            self.result = default
        def run(self):
            self.result = func(*args, **kwargs)
    it = InterruptableThread()
    it.start()
    it.join(timeout_duration)
    if it.isAlive():
        return it.result
    else:
        return it.result
</code></pre>

<p>Invoking it with a 5 second timeout:</p>

<pre><code>result = timeout(remote_calculate, (myarg,), timeout_duration=5)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If this is some kind of network or file operation, you might also consider using nonblocking IO.  This can be a better option if you're doing a lot of these types of operations at once (otherwise, you can bog your system down fairly quickly with a lot of threads).  <a href="http://www.amk.ca/python/howto/sockets/sockets.html#SECTION000600000000000000000" rel="nofollow">Here</a>'s a socket howto that covers nonblocking IO (in the context of network operations).</p>

<p>The downside?  Well, it can be a pain to program.  Sometimes even moreso than just using a thread.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Maybe try to call it from other thread, which You could easily terminate.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>What yabcok said - start a new thread to call the function. In the original thread, sleep for 5 seconds, then terminate the function thread if it hasn't already ended.</p>

<p>Maybe there is a better approach to your problem? Why might the function take longer than 5 seconds?</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I would use the time() method from time to compare the time while you're running your function, but clearly this only works if you'd be hitting an infinite loop, not a function hanging.</p>

<pre><code>def meth():
    start_time = time()
    while(whatever):
        do_something
        if time() - smart_time &gt; 5:
            return
</code></pre>

<p>But I'm just a small fry.</p>
