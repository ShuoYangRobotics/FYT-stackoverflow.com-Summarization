<h3>Question (ID-6970122):</h3><h2>Using a variable as both an integer and a string (Python)</h2><p>I would like to use a variable as an integer and a string in the same statement. In BASIC, it would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>cnt = 0

while cnt &lt; 10:
    cnt = cnt + 1
    print cnt + " + 1 = " + cnt + 1 
</code></pre>

<p>I understand it's a bit different with Python (integers have to be converted before you print them as strings, but here using a function such as "cnt = str(cnt)" doesn't seem to work very well). What would be the easy way to do this?</p>

<pre><code>print '%d + 1 = %d' % (cnt, cnt + 1)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>For Python 2.6+, the <code>format</code> method is the preferred way to build up strings containing other values:</p>

<pre><code>'{0} + 1 = {1}'.format(cnt, cnt + 1)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You had it nearly right; you just need to tell Python exactly when to make something a string.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; cnt = 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; while cnt &lt; 10:
...     cnt += 1
...     print str(cnt) + " + 1 = " + str(cnt + 1)
... 
1 + 1 = 2
2 + 1 = 3
3 + 1 = 4
4 + 1 = 5
5 + 1 = 6
6 + 1 = 7
7 + 1 = 8
8 + 1 = 9
9 + 1 = 10
10 + 1 = 11
</code></pre>

<p>Strictly speaking, you aren't treating <code>cnt</code> as both an integer and a string here -- it's always an integer.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><pre><code>print str(cnt) + " + 1 = " + str(cnt + 1)
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>print "%d + 1 = %d" % (cnt, cnt+1)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><pre><code>cnt = 0

while cnt &lt; 10:
    print str(cnt) + " + 1 = " + str(cnt + 1)
    cnt = cnt + 1
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>for cnt in range(10):
    print str(cnt) + " + 1 = " + str(cnt + 1)
</code></pre>

<p>or </p>

<pre><code>for cnt in range(10):
    print "%d + 1 = %d".format(cnt, cnt + 1)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You can print <code>int</code>s as well as <code>str</code>ings.  You may be confused by some of the answers if you know that it is quite possible to write <code>print cnt</code> on its own, without explicitly putting it into a string.</p>

<p>The string formatting language is useful and powerful and something you do need to know about.  But it's perfectly fine to write</p>

<pre><code>print cnt, "+ 1 =", cnt + 1
</code></pre>

<p>which is closer in spirit to what you asked.  Python automatically adds spaces between the arguments, and a newline character at the end of the line (to suppress this, add another comma at the end).</p>
