<h3>Question (ID-4661753):</h3><h2>Executing JavaScript with Python without X</h2><p>I want to parse a html-page that unfortunately requires JavaScript to show any content. In order to do so I use a small python-script that pulls the html-code of the page, but after that I have to execute the JavaScript in a DOM-context which seems pretty hard.</p>

<p>To make it even harder I want to use it in a server environment that has no X11-server.</p>

<p>Note: I already read about <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pywebkitgtk/" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/pywebkitgtk/</a> but it seems to need a X-server.</p>

However, in order to make use of it, you will have to embed some kind of JavaScript runtime (e.g. <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/" rel="nofollow">Rhino</a>) in your program (or spawn one as an external process).</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You could try using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xvfb" rel="nofollow">Xvfb</a> to have a fake frame buffer, so you won't need to run X11 (though it may be a dependency of Xvfb on your system). Most rendering engines don't have a headless mode, so something like Xvfb is necessary to run them. I used this technique successfully using XULRunner to navigate web pages, though not from python.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I use VNC or Xvfb for this purpose, combined with Firefox. After experimenting with the two, I settled on <a href="http://www.tightvnc.com/" rel="nofollow">XTightVNC</a>. We use it to create screenshots on demand for various test purposes. It's nice to use one of these because you're executing it in an actual browser, same as a user would be (though most users probably won't be using the same OS as your server).</p>

<p>The handy thing about using VNC is that you can connect remotely to set up and test the browser when needed.</p>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I'm still trying to figure this out myself, so take my answer with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>So far, I found <a href="http://blog.motane.lu/2009/06/18/pywebkitgtk-execute-javascript-from-python/" rel="nofollow">http://blog.motane.lu/2009/06/18/pywebkitgtk-execute-javascript-from-python/</a>, which describes the use and the quirks of Pywebkitgtk by someone who has similar needs to what we do.</p>

<p>Later, however, the writer of that blogpost discovered that he can't get it to work with Xvbf, so he hunted some more and found a Qt webkit (possibly in Qt itself, if I understand correctly) <a href="http://blog.motane.lu/2009/07/07/downloading-a-pages-content-with-python-and-webkit/" rel="nofollow">http://blog.motane.lu/2009/07/07/downloading-a-pages-content-with-python-and-webkit/</a>.  Apparently it's a much better solution than PywebkitGTK.</p>

<p>Naturally, I'll be looking into the other solutions offered here--but I wanted to bring up the Qt solution, because to me, it seems the most likely candidate for what I want to do...and if not, then perhaps it will be for someone else, looking for an answer to this question! :-)</p>
