<h3>Question (ID-39960):</h3><h2>javascript locals()?</h2><p>In python one can get a dictionary of all local and global variables in the current scope with the built-in functions locals() and globals().  Is there some equivalent way of doing this in javascript?  For instance, I would like to do something like the following:</p>

<pre><code>var foo = function(){ alert('foo'); };
var bar = function(){ alert('bar'); };

var s = 'foo';
locals()[s](); // alerts 'foo'
</code></pre>

<p>Is this at all possible, or should I just be using a local object for the lookup?</p>

<p><code>window</code> is a reference to the global scope, like <code>globals()</code> in python.</p>

<pre><code>globals()["foo"]
</code></pre>

<p>is the same as:</p>

<pre><code>window["foo"]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Well, I don't think that there is something like that in js. You can always use eval instead of locals(). Like this: </p>

<pre><code>eval(s+"()");
</code></pre>

<p>You just have to know that actually function <em>foo</em> exists.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>Don't use eval:) Use:</p>

<pre><code>var functionName="myFunctionName";
window[functionName]();
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>AFAIK, no. If you just want to check the existence of a given variable, you can do it by testing for it, something like this:</p>

<pre><code>if (foo) foo();
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I seem to remember Brendan Eich commented on this in a recent podcast; if i recall correctly, it's not being considered, as it adds unreasonable restrictions to optimization. He compared it to the <code>arguments</code> local in that, while useful for varargs, its very existence removes the ability to guess at what a function will touch just by looking at its definition. </p>

<p>BTW: i believe JS <em>did</em> have support for accessing locals through the arguments local at one time - <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Functions/arguments" rel="nofollow">a quick search</a> shows this has been deprecated though.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>@e-bartek, I think that window[functionName] won't work if you in some closure, and the function name is local to that closure.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>function foo() {
    var bar = function () {
        alert('hello world');
    };
    var s = 'bar';
    window[s](); // this won't work
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, s is 'bar', but the function 'bar' only exists inside the scope of the function 'foo'.  It is not defined in the window scope.</p>

<p>Of course, this doesn't really answer the original question, I just wanted to chime in on this response.  I don't believe there is a way to do what the original question asked.</p>

<p>Yes, you're right. <em>window[functionName]()</em> doesn't work in this case, but <em>eval</em> does. If I needed something like this, I'd create my own object to keep those functions together.</p>

<pre><code>var func = {};
func.bar = ...;
var s = "bar";
func[s]();
</code></pre>
