<h3>Question (ID-676159):</h3><h2>Create static graphics files (png, gif, jpg) using Ruby or Python</h2><p>I'd like to create a graphic image on the fly based on user input, and then present that image as a PNG file (or jpg or gif if necessary, but PNG is preferred).</p>

<p>This is actually for an astrology application; what I'd like to do is generate the chart in PNG for display.</p>

<p>Python or Ruby is fine; in fact, the library available may determine the language I use.</p>

<h3>Update</h3>

<p>Here's an example image:<br />

<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>In Python, you'd typically use PIL, the Python Image Library. I've never used PIL for anything beyond the simplest tasks, so I can't say how well it performs in practice.</p>

<p>I'd start digging into PIL with a look at <a href="http://www.pythonware.com/library/pil/" rel="nofollow">its documentation</a>, particularly the <a href="http://www.pythonware.com/library/pil/handbook/imagedraw.htm" rel="nofollow">documentation for the draw module</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Maybe a vectorial format is better suited for your needs, but is hard to tell without having a concrete example of what you'd like to get.</p>

<p>For example, if the images are all alike, you could create a SVG base image with Inkscape, then edit it programmaticaly from Python or Ruby (either by editing the text or using a XML library) and finally export it to PNG.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
After seeing the example image, I think SVG would be the most convenient choice.  A SVG image is an XML file that basically says "draw a circle from here to here, write the string '13ยบ52' there", etc.  You could draw a unique base chart in Inkscape and have your program just adding the lines and symbols for each case.  Finally you export to PNG.</p>

<p>The advantages are: easier for you to draw, the image is fully scalable, you can change the styling just by editing a property ("make all lines wider", "change all text to Arial", "paint the background blue"), you can export to any format without losing quality, and I think it's more mantainable.</p>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Look at <a href="http://gd2.rubyforge.org/" rel="nofollow">Ruby-GD2</a> or an ImageMagick or GraphicsMagick binding.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>For Python I the most common choice for image formats is PIL and then <a href="http://cairographics.org/pycairo/" rel="nofollow">Pycairo</a> for vector formats.  The two can work together, for exadmple in this cookbook entry to <a href="http://cairographics.org/pythoncairopil/" rel="nofollow">use PIL images for Pycairo surfaces</a>.</p>
