<h3>Question (ID-2329417):</h3><h2>Fastest Way to Delete a Line from Large File in Python</h2><p>I am working with a very large (~11GB) text file on a Linux system.  I am running it through a program which is checking the file for errors.  Once an error is found, I need to either fix the line or remove the line entirely.  And then repeat...</p>

<p>Eventually once I'm comfortable with the process, I'll automate it entirely.  For now however, let's assume I'm running this by hand.</p>

<p>What would be the fastest (in terms of execution time) way to remove a specific line from this large file?  I thought of doing it in Python...but would be open to other examples.  The line might be <em>anywhere</em> in the file.</p>

<p>If Python, assume the following interface:</p>

<p><code>def removeLine(filename, lineno):</code></p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You can have two file objects for the same file at the same time (one for reading, one for writing):</p>

<pre><code>def removeLine(filename, lineno):
    fro = open(filename, "rb")

    current_line = 0
    while current_line &lt; lineno:
        fro.readline()
        current_line += 1

    seekpoint = fro.tell()
    frw = open(filename, "r+b")
    frw.seek(seekpoint, 0)

    # read the line we want to discard
    fro.readline()

    # now move the rest of the lines in the file 
    # one line back 
    chars = fro.readline()
    while chars:
        frw.writelines(chars)
        chars = fro.readline()

    fro.close()
    frw.truncate()
    frw.close()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Modify the file <strong>in place</strong>, offending line is replaced with spaces so the remainder of the file does not need to be shuffled around on disk. You can also "<em>fix</em>" the line in place if the fix is not longer than the line you are replacing</p>

<pre><code>import os
from mmap import mmap
def removeLine(filename, lineno):
    f=os.open(filename, os.O_RDWR)
    m=mmap(f,0)
    p=0
    for i in range(lineno-1):
        p=m.find('\n',p)+1
    q=m.find('\n',p)
    m[p:q] = ' '*(q-p)
    os.close(f)
</code></pre>

<p>If the other program can be changed to output the fileoffset instead of the line number, you can assign the offset to p directly and do without the for loop</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>As far as I know, you can't just open a txt file with python and remove a line. You have to make a new file and move everything but that line to it. If you know the specific line, then you would do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>f = open('in.txt')
fo = open('out.txt','w')

ind = 1
for line in f:
    if ind != linenumtoremove:
        fo.write(line)
    ind += 1

f.close()
fo.close()
</code></pre>

<p>You could of course check the contents of the line instead to determine if you want to keep it or not. I also recommend that if you have a whole list of lines to be removed/changed to do all those changes in one pass through the file.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>If the lines are variable length then I don't believe that there is a better algorithm than reading the file line by line and writing out all lines, except for the one(s) that you do not want.</p>

<p>You can identify these lines by checking some criteria, or by keeping a running tally of lines read and suppressing the writing of the line(s) that you do not want.</p>

<p>If the lines are fixed length and you want to delete specific line numbers, then you may be able to use <code>seek</code> to move the file pointer... I doubt you're that lucky though.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Update: solution using sed as requested by poster in comment.</p>

<p>To delete for example the second line of file:</p>

<pre><code>sed '2d' input.txt
</code></pre>

<p>Use the <code>-i</code> switch to edit in place. Warning: this is a destructive operation. Read the help for this command for information on how to make a backup automatically.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><pre><code>def removeLine(filename, lineno):
    in = open(filename)
    out = open(filename + ".new", "w")
    for i, l in enumerate(in, 1):
        if i != lineno:
            out.write(l)
    in.close()
    out.close()
    os.rename(filename + ".new", filename)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I think there was a somewhat similar if not exactly the same type of question asked here. Reading (and writing) line by line is slow, but you can read a bigger chunk into memory at once, go through that line by line skipping lines you don't want, then writing this as a single chunk to a new file. Repeat until done. Finally replace the original file with the new file.</p>

<p>The thing to watch out for is when you read in a chunk, you need to deal with the last, potentially partial line you read, and prepend that into the next chunk you read.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>@OP, if you can use awk, eg assuming line number is 10</p>

<pre><code>$ awk 'NR!=10' file &gt; newfile
</code></pre>
