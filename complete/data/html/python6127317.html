<h3>Question (ID-6127317):</h3><h2>Anchors in Regex</h2><ol>
<li>In a Python Regex, must ^ or $
appear just once?</li>
<li><p>I tried to match two lines with</p>

<pre><code>^(.*\|.*)$^.*$
</code></pre>

<p>It does not work. How do you match
several lines?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Note: I am not programming in Python, but using Python-style Regex in my editor gedit.</p>

<p>Thanks and regards!</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>As other answers have said, you are looking for <code>re.MULTILINE</code>, but even with that your regex won't work.</p>

<p><code>$</code> matches the position <em>before</em> the line break, and <code>^</code> matches the start of a line, so <code>$^</code> in the middle of a regex will never match.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; re.search("^(.*)$^.*$", multiline_string, re.M)    # won't match
&gt;&gt;&gt; re.search("^(.*)$\n^.*$", multiline_string, re.M)  # will match
&lt;_sre.SRE_Match object at 0xb7f3e5e0&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You need something to match the end of line characters between the <code>$</code> and the <code>^</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Take a look at <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/re.html#re.MULTILINE" rel="nofollow"><code>re.MULTILINE</code></a>.</p>

<p>I quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When specified, the pattern character
  <code>'^'</code> matches at the beginning of the
  string and at the beginning of each
  line (immediately following each
  newline); and the pattern character
  <code>'$'</code> matches at the end of the string
  and at the end of each line
  (immediately preceding each newline).</p>
  
  <p>By default, <code>'^'</code> matches only at the
  beginning of the string, and <code>'$'</code> only
  at the end of the string and
  immediately before the newline (if
  any) at the end of the string.</p>
</blockquote>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You have to use re.MULTILINE ( or even re.DOTALL if you change regex and depending on what you actually want to match / do )</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>re.MULTILINE</p>
  
  <p>When specified, the pattern character
  '^' matches at the beginning
  of the string and at the beginning of
  each line (immediately following each
  newline); and the pattern character
  '$' matches at the end of the string
  and at the end of each line
  (immediately preceding each newline).</p>
  
  <p>By default, '^' matches only at the
  beginning of the string, and '$' only
  at the end of the string and
  immediately before the newline (if
  any) at the end of the string.</p>

<p>BTW, what are you doing with - <code>^(.*\|.*)$^.*$</code> - that is not a very good regex! ( ignoring the fact that you have the multiple <code>$</code> and <code>^</code> which is the point of the question. )</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I would refer to the python regex manual <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/re.html#re.MULTILINE" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/library/re.html#re.MULTILINE</a></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Prefixing your regex with (?m) should do what you need (tells the regex engine that it's going to receive multiline texts, and that ^/$ match the beginning/end of a line instead of the whole text).</p>

<p>Edit: after looking at your regex a bit more, I think you also need to put (?s), meaning that you want dot to match newline characters. For example:</p>

<pre><code>(?m)(?s)^hello.*?world$
</code></pre>

<p>correctly matched "helloworld" for me in a case like this:</p>

<pre><code>dssdf
hello
world
sdfasdf
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>To add to other answers. You can get away with putting the re.MULTILINE modifier directly into the regex:</p>

<pre><code>(?m)^(.*\|.*)$\n^.*$
</code></pre>
