<h3>Question (ID-305359):</h3><h2>Correct way to detect sequence parameter?</h2><p>I want to write a function that accepts a parameter which can be either a sequence or a single value. The type of value is str, int, etc., but I <strong>don't</strong> want it to be restricted to a hardcoded list. 
In other words, I want to know if the parameter X is a sequence or something I have to convert to a sequence to avoid special-casing later. I could do</p>

<p><code>type(X) in (list, tuple)</code></p>

<p>but there may be other sequence types I'm not aware of, and no common base class.</p>

<p>-N.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: See my "answer" below for why most of these answers don't help me. Maybe you have something better to suggest.</p>

<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import collections
&gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance([], collections.Sequence)
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance(0, collections.Sequence)
False
</code></pre>

<p>Furthermore ABC's can be customized to account for exceptions, such as not considering strings to be sequences.  Here an example:</p>

<pre><code>import abc
import collections

class Atomic(object):
    __metaclass__ = abc.ABCMeta
    @classmethod
    def __subclasshook__(cls, other):
        return not issubclass(other, collections.Sequence) or NotImplemented

Atomic.register(basestring)
</code></pre>

<p>After registration the <strong>Atomic</strong> class can be used with <strong>isinstance</strong> and <strong>issubclass</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>assert isinstance("hello", Atomic) == True
</code></pre>

<p>This is still much better than a hard-coded list, because you only need to register the exceptions to the rule, and external users of the code can register their own.</p>

<p>In older versions, there are type checkers in the operator module.</p>

<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import operator
&gt;&gt;&gt; operator.isSequenceType([])
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; operator.isSequenceType(0)
False
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Sequences are described here:
<a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/lib/typesseq.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/lib/typesseq.html</a></p>

<p>So sequences are not the same as iterable objects. I think sequence must implement
<code>__getitem__</code>, whereas iterable objects must implement <code>__iter__</code>.
So for example string are sequences and don't implement <code>__iter__</code>, xrange objects are sequences and don't implement <code>__getslice__</code>.</p>

<p>But from what you seen to want to do, I'm not sure you want sequences, but rather iterable objects.
So go for <code>hasattr("__getitem__", X)</code> you want sequences, but go rather <code>hasattr("__iter__", X)</code> if you don't want strings for example.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>IMHO, the python way is to pass the list as *list. As in:</p>

<pre><code>myfunc(item)
myfunc(*items)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><blockquote>
  <p>The problem with all of the above
  mentioned ways is that str is
  considered a sequence (it's iterable,
  has <strong>getitem</strong>, etc.) yet it's
  usually treated as a single item.</p>
  
  <p>For example, a function may accept an
  argument that can either be a filename
  or a list of filenames. What's the
  most Pythonic way for the function to
  detect the first from the latter?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Based on the revised question, it sounds like what you want is something more like:</p>

<pre><code>def to_sequence(arg):
    ''' 
    determine whether an arg should be treated as a "unit" or a "sequence"
    if it's a unit, return a 1-tuple with the arg
    '''
    def _multiple(x):  
        return hasattr(x,"__iter__")
    if _multiple(arg):  
        return arg
    else:
        return (arg,)

&gt;&gt;&gt; to_sequence("a string")
('a string',)
&gt;&gt;&gt; to_sequence( (1,2,3) )
(1, 2, 3)
&gt;&gt;&gt; to_sequence( xrange(5) )
xrange(5)
</code></pre>

<p>This isn't guaranteed to handle <em>all</em> types, but it handles the cases you mention quite well, and should do the right thing for most of the built-in types.</p>

<p>When using it, make sure whatever receives the output of this can handle iterables.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>In cases like this, I prefer to just always take the sequence type or always take the scalar.  Strings won't be the only types that would behave poorly in this setup; rather, any type that has an aggregate use and allows iteration over its parts might misbehave.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>The simplest method would be to check if you can turn it into an iterator.  ie</p>

<pre><code>try:
    it = iter(X)
    # Iterable
except TypeError:
    # Not iterable
</code></pre>

<p>If you need to ensure that it's a restartable or random access sequence (ie not a generator etc), this approach won't be sufficient however.</p>

<p>As others have noted, strings are also iterable, so if you need so exclude them (particularly important if recursing through items, as list(iter('a')) gives ['a'] again, then you may need to specifically exclude them with:</p>

<pre><code> if not isinstance(X, basestring)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p><strong>Revised answer:</strong> </p>

<p>I don't know if your idea of "sequence" matches what the Python manuals call a "<a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/lib/typesseq.html" rel="nofollow">Sequence Type</a>", but in case it does, you should look for the __Contains__ method. That is the method Python uses to implement the check "if something in object:"</p>

<pre><code>if hasattr(X, '__contains__'):
    print "X is a sequence"
</code></pre>

<p><strong>My original answer:</strong></p>

<p>I would check if the object that you received implements an iterator interface:</p>

<pre><code>if hasattr(X, '__iter__'):
    print "X is a sequence"
</code></pre>

<p>For me, that's the closest match to your definition of sequence since that would allow you to do something like:</p>

<pre><code>for each in X:
    print each
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>I'm new here so I don't know what's the correct way to do it. I want to answer my answers:</p>

<p>The problem with all of the above mentioned ways is that <strong><code>str</code></strong> is considered a sequence (it's iterable, has <code>__getitem__</code>, etc.) yet it's usually treated as a single item.</p>

<p>For example, a function may accept an argument that can either be a filename or a list of filenames. What's the most Pythonic way for the function to detect the first from the latter?</p>

<p>Should I post this as a new question? Edit the original one?</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>If strings are the problem, detect a sequence and filter out the special case of strings:</p>

<pre><code>def is_iterable(x):
  if type(x) == str:
    return False
  try:
    iter(x)
    return True
  except TypeError:
    return False
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>I think what I would do is check whether the object has certain methods that indicate it is a sequence.  I'm not sure if there is an official definition of what makes a sequence.  The best I can think of is, it must support slicing.  So you could say:</p>

<pre><code>is_sequence = '__getslice__' in dir(X)
</code></pre>

<p>You might also check for the particular functionality you're going to be using.</p>

<p>As pi pointed out in the comment, one issue is that a string is a sequence, but you probably don't want to treat it as one.  You could add an explicit test that the type is not str.</p>
<br /><b>#10</b><br /><p>You're asking the wrong question. You don't try to detect types in Python; you detect behavior.</p>

<ol>
<li>Write another function that handles a single value. (let's call it _use_single_val).</li>
<li>Write one function that handles a sequence parameter. (let's call it _use_sequence).</li>
<li>Write a third parent function that calls the two above. (call it use_seq_or_val). Surround each call with an exception handler to catch an invalid parameter (i.e. not single value or sequence).</li>
<li>Write unit tests to pass correct &amp; incorrect parameters to the parent function to make sure it catches the exceptions properly.</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>
    def _use_single_val(v):
        print v + 1  # this will fail if v is not a value type

    def _use_sequence(s):
        print s[0]   # this will fail if s is not indexable

    def use_seq_or_val(item):    
        try:
            _use_single_val(item)
        except TypeError:
            pass

        try:
            _use_sequence(item)
        except TypeError:
            pass

        raise TypeError, "item not a single value or sequence"
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: Revised to handle the "sequence or single value" asked about in the question. </p>
<br /><b>#11</b><br /><p>You could pass your parameter in the built-in len() function and check whether this causes an error. As others said, the string type requires special handling.</p>

<p>According to the documentation the len function can accept a sequence (string, list, tuple) or a dictionary.</p>

<p>You could check that an object is a string with the following code:</p>

<pre><code>x.__class__ == "".__class__
</code></pre>
