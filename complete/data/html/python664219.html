<h3>Question (ID-664219):</h3><h2>Uninitialized value in Python?</h2><p>What's the uninitialized value in Python, so I can compare if something is initialized, like:</p>

<pre><code>val

if val == undefined ?
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: added a pseudo keyword.</p>

<p>EDIT2: I think I didn't make it clear, but say val is already there, but nothing is assigned to it.</p>

<br /><h3>Answers (Total-9):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Will throw a <code>NameError</code> exception:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; val
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
NameError: name 'val' is not defined
</code></pre>

<p>You can either catch that or use <code>'val' in dir()</code>, i.e.:</p>

<pre><code>try:
    val
except NameError:
    print("val not set")
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>if 'val' in dir():
    print('val set')
else:
    print('val not set')
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>A name does not exist unless a value is assigned to it. There is None, which generally represents no usable value, but it is a value in its own right.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>In python, variables either refer to an object, or they don't exist. If they don't exist, you will get a NameError.   Of course, one of the objects they might refer to is <code>None</code>.</p>

<pre><code>try:
   val
except NameError:
   print "val is not set"


if val is None:
   print "val is None"
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>In Python, for a variable to exist, something must have been assigned to it.  You can think of your variable name as a dictionary key that must have some value associated with it (even if that value is None).</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><pre><code>try:
    print val
except NameError:
    print "val wasn't set."
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>To add to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/664219/uninitialized-value-of-python/664222#664222">phihag's answer</a>: you can use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#dir" rel="nofollow"><code>dir()</code></a> to get a list of all of the variables in the current scope, so if you want to test if <code>var</code> is in the current scope without using exceptions, you can do:</p>

<pre><code>if 'var' in dir():
    # var is in scope
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p><strong>Q: How do I discover if a variable is defined at a point in my code?</strong></p>

<p><strong>A: Read up in the source file until you see a line where that variable is defined.</strong></p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>This question leads on to some fun diversions concerning the nature of python objects and it's garbage collector:</p>

<p>It's probably helpful to understand that all variables in python are really pointers, that is they are names in a namespace (implemented as a hash-table) whch point to an address in memory where the object actually resides. </p>

<p>Asking for the value of an uninitialized variable is the same as asking for the value of the thing a pointer points to when the pointer has not yet been created yet... it's obviously nonsense which is why the most sensible thing Python can do is throw a meaningful NameError.</p>

<p>Another oddity of the python language is that it's possible that an object exists long before you execute an assignment statement. Consider:</p>

<pre><code>a = 1
</code></pre>

<p>Did you magically create an int(1) object here? Nope - it already existed. Since int(1) is an immutable singleton there are already a few hundred pointers to it:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; sys.getrefcount(a)
592
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Fun, eh?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> commment by JFS (posted here to show the code)</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 1 + 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; sys.getrefcount(a) # integers less than 256 (or so) are cached
145
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = 1000 + 1000
&gt;&gt;&gt; sys.getrefcount(b) 
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; sys.getrefcount(2000)
3
&gt;&gt;&gt; sys.getrefcount(1000+1000)
2
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>Usually a value of <code>None</code> is used to mark something as "declared but not yet initialized; I would consider an uninitialized variable a defekt in the code</p>
