<h3>Question (ID-4634935):</h3><h2>Game engine with python scripting?</h2><p>Looking to put together a 3D side-scrolling action platformer. Since this is my first time trying to put together a non-simple adventure game, I'm at a loss for which engine to consider.</p>

<p>I would prefer one that supports scripting in python, since that's my primary language. Without tight controls, the game will suck... so speed is a priority. Cross-platform is also important to me.</p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>This is what I would use: <a href="http://unity3d.com/" rel="nofollow">Unity</a>.  It has a learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, it's very powerful.  It uses your choice of Java, Boo(which I hear is very similar to Python), and C#.</p>

<p>Regardless of what you pick, I would advise you learn Java.  It's a widespread language, so it should open up lots of options for you in various ventures.  Learning another language is always very good for you.</p>

<p>It's a 3D game engine written in C++ but specifically designed for use in Python. Disney has used it for some of its games in the past, including 2 MMOs. There is support for shaders, etc., and is BSD licensed. Windows, Mac, and Linux are all supported, and there appears to be a browser plugin. I haven't used it personally, though.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/tikiwiki/PyOgre" rel="nofollow">PyOgre</a> is the Python bindings of the C++ graphics engine Ogre.</p>
