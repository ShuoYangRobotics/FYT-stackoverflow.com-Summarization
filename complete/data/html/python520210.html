<h3>Question (ID-520210):</h3><h2>Where is Python used? I read about it a lot on Reddit</h2><p>I have downloaded the Pyscripter and learning Python. But I have no Idea if it has any job value , especially in India. I am learning Python as a Hobby. But it would be comforting to know if Python programmers are in demand in India.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_software" rel="nofollow">list of python software</a> for more info, and also <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/essays/ppt/www8-py-www/sld010.htm" rel="nofollow">who uses python on the web?</a></p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>In many large companies it is a primary scripting language.
Google is using it along with Java and C++ and almost nothing else.
Also many web pages are built on top of python and Django. 
Another place is game development. Many games have their engines written in C++ but all the logic in Python.</p>

<p>In other words it is one of the most valuable tools.</p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>It definitely has job value. For instance Google requires it. Have a look at <a href="http://www.google.co.in/support/jobs/bin/topic.py?dep_id=1054&amp;loc_id=1100&amp;topic=1054" rel="nofollow">Google openings in India</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Excellent programming skills in at
  least one of the following languages:
  C, C++, Java or Python (C++/Python
  preferred)</p>
</blockquote>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Not sure about India, but you can get a decent overview of available Python jobs on the python.org jobs page <a href="http://www.python.org/community/jobs/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. </p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Try looking at Mark Pilgrim's excellent book "<a href="http://www.diveintopython.org/" rel="nofollow">Dive Into Python</a>" which is available for download under GNU Free Documentation License.</p>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>In 10 years of web development I've had 1 client have me write an email parsing app with it.  Not that it doesn't get used, but I've seen Ruby/php/.net way more often in the wild.</p>

<p>Edit:
From the other posts if you plan on working at Google, it sounds like the language to learn - LOL!</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>It's juste one example but I know it is widely used in large scientific institutions with high tech machinery where non-programmers (typically physicists) need quick prototypes or tools to cover their data collection/processing needs. The easy-to access scripting language aspect clearly plays its role here. So I don't know about building a career out of that only but I'd definitely say that knowing Python is a very valuable asset on your resume, it'll strengthen your "smell of usefulness".</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>The google app engine lets you use python (or Java).  I HIGHLY recommend that you check it out.  If you want to have a FREE website with a database (actually a datastore but it works much like a database) using python, THIS IS IT.  It scales up too.  If you start to get enough traffic you would have to start paying for the usage it requires.</p>

<p>You could make your own python based site and run some ads.  Voila, make some money.  Also, I'm sure google could be impressed by some good python because I hear they use it for much of their own sites.</p>
