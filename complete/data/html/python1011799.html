<h3>Question (ID-1011799):</h3><h2>How can I accurately program an automated "click" on Windows?</h2><p>I wrote a program to click on an application automatically at scheduled time using Win32, using <code>MOUSE_DOWN</code> and <code>MOUSE_UP</code>.  It usually works well, except I found that I need to put in a </p>

<pre><code>sleep 0.1
</code></pre>

<p>between the <code>MOUSE_DOWN</code> and <code>MOUSE_UP</code>.  (using Ruby, which allows sleeping a fraction of a second).</p>

<p>Without the sleep, sometimes the click doesn't go through.  But I noticed that sometimes, the click is "too long".  The click is actually on a Flash app's Right Arrow.  This right arrow will go to the next item on a list.  So if you <code>MOUSE_DOWN</code> for a little longer, it actually will shift 2 or 3 items instead of just 1 item.</p>

<p>So I wonder, is there a way to accurately simulate 1 click in this case.  Probably there is no <code>MOUSE_CLICK</code> event?  It has to be simulated using <code>MOUSE_DOWN</code> and <code>MOUSE_UP</code>?</p>

<p>(it is actually called <code>MOUSEEVENTF_LEFTDOWN</code> and <code>MOUSEEVENTF_LEFTUP</code> on Win32, just for simplicity it is stated as <code>MOUSE_DOWN</code> instead.)</p>

I had good experiences with it for automating things like mouseclicks or keystrokes.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You do not decide what delay setting between mouse down and mouse up results in a valid single click, the operating system does.</p>

<p>No <code>sleep</code> function can guarantee the timing between the mouse down and mouse up events you want. Perl's <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~karasik/Win32-GuiTest-1.56/" rel="nofollow">Win32::GuiTest</a> module allows you to send an actual click event rather than messing with the timing of down and up events. <strong>Later:</strong> Looking at the source code, Win32::GuiTest seems to just fire mouse down and up events without any delay between them <a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/KARASIK/Win32-GuiTest-1.56/lib/Win32/GuiTest.pm" rel="nofollow">see GuiTest.pm</a>:</p>

<pre><code>elsif ( $item =~ /leftclick/i ) {
    SendLButtonDown ();
    SendLButtonUp ();
}
</code></pre>

<p>In addition, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms646260(VS.85).aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms646260(VS.85).aspx</a> states that <code>mouse_event</code> has been superseded by <code>SendInput</code> <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms646310(VS.85).aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms646310(VS.85).aspx</a> which allows you to send a <code>MOUSEINPUT</code> event with timestamps etc.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>What function(s) are you using to accomplish this?</p>

<p>I'd expect <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms646310.aspx" rel="nofollow">SendInput</a> with a chain of 2 passed in MOUSEINPUT structures (one button down, the other button up) would pull this off for you.  You can even play games with the timestamps on the faked events to more deterministic behavior than you'll get with sleep().</p>

<p>There's no CLICK to send, as its the responsibility of an application to collapse low level events (mouse move, button down, button up, key down, key up, etc.) into "user level" events.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>Some code, to clarify.  This is straight-up untested/compiled C (read: the bad kind of C), but  I hope it illustrates my point.</p>

<pre><code>LPINPUT events = (LPINPUT)malloc(sizeof(INPUT) * 2);

events[0].type = INPUT_MOUSE;
events[0].mi.dwFlags = MOUSEEVENTF_LEFTDOWN;
events[0].mi.time = 0; //Here, you can play with timestamps (milliseconds)
events[1].type = INPUT_MOUSE;
events[1].mi.dwFlags = MOUSEEVENTF_LEFTUP;
events[1].mi.time = 0; //Likewise

//Push both events into the event queue
SendInput(2, events, sizeof(INPUT));
</code></pre>

<p>I have zero Ruby experience, so I don't know how you'd interop this for your case.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I guess 2 things:</p>

<ol>
<li>I bet ruby doesn't and can't guarantee that sleep 0.1 really sleeps only 0.1 seconds. As this is probably out of rubys control and OS controlled</li>
<li>The call to the Win32 API via Win32 itself may take an arbitrary time and cause the delay</li>
</ol>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Since the Windows API supports sleeping down to 1 millisecond, why not just sleep a shorter time? 0.01 seconds should be enough?</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I'd use AutoHotKey. It's open source and free, been around a long time and actively maintained, to the point that others have built an IDE for it. I use it for generating unique random test data for form testing but it does mouse stuff too. </p>
