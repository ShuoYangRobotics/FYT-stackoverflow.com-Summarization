<h3>Question (ID-8810765):</h3><h2>main method in Python</h2><p>I have the following code, which has the following two problems:</p>

<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\v\workspace\first\src\tests.py", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; 
  class Animal:
  File "C:\Users\v\workspace\first\src\tests.py", line 39, in Animal

  File "C:\Users\v\workspace\first\src\tests.py", line 31, in main
    dog = Animal()
NameError: global name 'Animal' is not defined
</code></pre>

<p>This code is from a tutorial, and in the tutorial it works fine. I have the Python 2.7 and use the PyDev plugin for Eclipse.</p>

<pre><code>  class Animal:
    __hungry = "yes"
    __name = "no name"
    __owner = "no owner"

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def set_owner(self,newOwner):
        self.__owner= newOwner
        return

    def get_owner(self):
        return self.__owner

    def set_name(self,newName):
        self.__name= newName
        return

    def get_name(self):
        return self.__name

    def noise(self):
        print('errr')
        return

    def __hiddenmethod(self):
        print("hard to find")


    def main():
        dog = Animal()    
        dog.set_owner('Sue')
        print dog.get_owner()
        dog.noise()


    if  __name__ =='__main__':main()
</code></pre>

<p>should not be in the class. When you take it outside (no indent) it should work.</p>

<p>So after taking that into account it should look like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Animal:
    __hungry = "yes"
    __name = "no name"
    __owner = "no owner"

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def set_owner(self,newOwner):
        self.__owner= newOwner
        return

    def get_owner(self):
        return self.__owner

    def set_name(self,newName):
        self.__name= newName
        return

    def get_name(self):
        return self.__name

    def noise(self):
        print('errr')
        return

    def __hiddenmethod(self):
        print("hard to find")


def main():
    dog = Animal()    
    dog.set_owner('Sue')
    print dog.get_owner()
    dog.noise()


if  __name__ =='__main__':
    main()

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>To understand <em>why</em> what you wrote failed, you need to know a little bit about how class definitions work in Python. As you may know, Python is an interpreted language: there is a program which reads through Python files and executes them as it goes. When the interpreter encounters a class definition, it does the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Creates a new namespace (record of all the variable names) in which the class variables and methods will be stored.</li>
<li>Extracts all the code within the class definition (as determined by its indentation) and runs that code. This will populate the namespace which it just created.</li>
<li>Creates a new class object whose namespace is that given above, and with base classes those given in the definition.</li>
<li>Binds the name of the class to this object.</li>
</ol>

<p>So what happened when you indented the <code>main</code> function inside your code? While inside step 2, you referred to the name <code>Animal</code>. But this name isn't defined until step 4! Indeed, it <em>can't</em> be defined at the stage you referred to it, because that would be circular. When you move <code>main</code> outside of the class definition, it won't be executed until after steps 1-4 have been completed, and hence the name <code>Animal</code> will already be bound.</p>

<hr>

<p>By the way, the code you have written is not good Python. You should probably try to find a better tutorial; the usual recommendation is "Dive Into Python". I've rewritten it as it should be done:</p>

<pre><code>  class Animal(object):
      def __init__(self, hungry="yes", name=None, owner=None):
          self.hungry = hungry
          self.name = name
          self.owner = owner

      def noise(self):
          print('errr')

      def _internal_method(self):
          print("hard to find")

  if  __name__ =='__main__':
      dog = Animal()    
      dog.owner = 'Sue'
      print dog.owner
      dog.noise()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Move both the <code>main()</code> method and the <code>if __name__ == '__main__'</code> statement out of the scope of the class.  Remember - whitespace counts.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Your indentation is off.  Remember that in Python, indentation counts.  Try:</p>

<pre><code>class Animal:
    __hungry = "yes"
    __name = "no name"
    __owner = "no owner"

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def set_owner(self,newOwner):
        self.__owner= newOwner
        return

    def get_owner(self):
        return self.__owner

    def set_name(self,newName):
        self.__name= newName
        return

    def get_name(self):
        return self.__name

    def noise(self):
        print('errr')
        return

    def __hiddenmethod(self):
        print("hard to find")

def main():
    dog = Animal()    
    dog.set_owner('Sue')
    print dog.get_owner()
    dog.noise()


if  __name__ =='__main__':main()

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>The following construct is worth having in most of your code - particularly if you are running in multiple environments.</p>

<pre><code>if  __name__ =='__main__':
    main()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>The main function you have defined looks like it is within the Animal class. Main should be a function(classes contain methods) outside of the animal class. You should also have your class Animal inherit from object ie</p>

<p>class Animal(object):</p>
