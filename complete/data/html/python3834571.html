<h3>Question (ID-3834571):</h3><h2>Python: Compare dict with a static reference?</h2><p>I have to check if a dictionary is the same as it was yesterday, if it has changed.</p>

<p>In PHP I could have serialized an array and compared the resulting strings from yesterday and today. However, I don't know how to do it in Py. I've read a little about Pickle and maybe it could be done with md5 somehow?</p>

<p>So basically I need a way to dismantle a dict into a comparable, storable value that is not a file and can be hardcoded into .py file.</p>

<p>Thanks,
A.R.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The problem with dictionaries is their undefined order. You must make sure you always get the same result of equal dictionaries (if you want to compare them as strings).</p>

<p>You could do it in multiple ways:</p>

<p>1) <strong>Python hash</strong> (only for checking equality; hash implementation might be specific to the Python version!)</p>

<pre><code>print hash(str(sorted({1 : 2, 3 : 4}.items())))
</code></pre>

<p>2) <strong>MD5</strong> (best if you only want to check equality)</p>

<pre><code>import hashlib
print hashlib.md5(str(sorted({1 : 2, 3 : 4}.items()))).hexdigest()
</code></pre>

<p>3) <strong>Pickling</strong> (serialization)</p>

<pre><code>import pickle
serializedString = pickle.dumps({1 : 2, 3 : 4})
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>pickle</code> module has different protocols (and I think it doesn't sort the dictionary items), so you can't do string comparison. You have to unpickle the data to a dictionary and then compare the old and new dictionary directly (<code>d = pickle.loads(serializedString)</code>).</p>

<p>4) <strong>Item tuple representation</strong> (serialization)</p>

<p>According to your comment, you want something embeddable into Python source code. As S.Lott suggested, you can use the object representation of <code>someDictionary.items()</code>, which is a list containing all (key, value) combinations as tuples (most probably unsorted):</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; repr({1 : 2, 3 : 4}.items())
'[(1, 2), (3, 4)]'
</code></pre>

<p>You can copy-and-paste this representation into your source code if you want the object serialized as a string .</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You could use JSON to get what you are asking for.</p>

<pre><code>from django.utils import simplejson as json

dict_1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
dict_2 = {'a': 2, 'b': 7, 'd': 9}

dict_1_str = json.dumps(dict_1, sort_keys=True)
dict_2_str = json.dumps(dict_2, sort_keys=True)

if dict_1_str == dict_2_str:
   # do something with the new dict...
   pass
</code></pre>

<p>The dict_X_str variables will contain a serialized version of the dict.  You can store it in memcahce or the datastore for later comparison.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><a href="http://docs.python.org/library/pickle.html" rel="nofollow"><code>pickle</code></a> is definitely what you're looking for.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><pre><code>pickle.dumps(set(yourdict.items()))
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>By using pickle you could create a new DictProperty allowing you to put the dict in the datastore and retrieve it later for comparison.</p>

<p>Here is one implementation: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1953784/can-i-store-a-python-dictionary-in-googles-bigtable-datastore-without-serializin/1953956#1953956">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1953784/can-i-store-a-python-dictionary-in-googles-bigtable-datastore-without-serializin/1953956#1953956</a></p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>If you do this, you get an object which is consistent and comparable.  It has a well-defined and predictable order.  You can use difflib to find differences.  Further, you can trivially rebuild the high-performance dictionary from it.</p>

<pre><code>static = list(sorted(some_dict.items()))

a_dict= dict( static )
</code></pre>
