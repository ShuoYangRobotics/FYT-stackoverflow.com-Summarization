<h3>Question (ID-571850):</h3><h2>Adding elements to python generators</h2><p>Is it possible to append elements to a python generator?</p>

<p>I'm currently trying to get all images from a set of disorganized folders and write them to a new directory. To get the files, I'm using os.walk() which returns a list of image files in a single directory. While I can make a generator out of this single list, I don't know how to combine all these lists into one single generator. Any help would be much appreciated.</p>

<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>This should do it, where <code>directories</code> is your list of directories:</p>

<pre><code>import os
import itertools

generators = [os.walk(d) for d in directories]
for root, dirs, files in itertools.chain(*generators):
    print root, dirs, files
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You are looking for <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/itertools.html" rel="nofollow"><code>itertools.chain</code></a>. It will combine multiple iterables into a single one, like this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in itertools.chain([1,2,3], [4,5,6]):
...  print i
... 
1
2
3
4
5
6
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><pre><code>def files_gen(topdir='.'):
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(topdir):
        # ... do some stuff with files
        for f in files:
            yield os.path.join(root, f)
        # ... do other stuff

for f in files_gen():
    print f
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Just yeld each of generated element individually, not as list.</p>

<p>UPDATE: I've just discovered itertools.chain() that should be effective and elegant solution.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Like this.</p>

<pre><code>def threeGens( i, j, k ):
    for x in range(i):
       yield x
    for x in range(j):
       yield x
    for x in range(k):
       yield x
</code></pre>

<p>Works well. </p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>hey, thanks, this is was I was looking for too:</p>

<p>I had this code snippet...</p>

<pre><code>grids = []
for item in input_files:
  grids.extend([... some list comprehension ...])
</code></pre>

<p>and wanted to rewrite it using generators...  my first guess (and hope) was this:</p>

<pre><code>grids = generator()
for item in input_files:
  grids.extend((... some list comprehension ...))
</code></pre>

<p>but there's no such constructor nor method.  using itertools I have this:</p>

<pre><code>grids = itertools.chain()
for item in input_files:
  grids = itertools.chain(grids, (... some list comprehension ...))
</code></pre>

<p>which seems good enough to me.<br />
thanks to stackoverflow and their users!</p>
