<h3>Question (ID-3438531):</h3><h2>IPython workflow (edit, run)</h2><p>Is there a GUI for IPython that allows me to open/run/edit Python files? My way of working in IDLE is to have two windows open: the shell and a .py file. I edit the .py file, run it, and interact with the results in the shell. </p>

<p>Is it possible to use IPython like this? Or is there an alternative way of working?</p>

<p>Though it sounds like what you want is IPython's magic function <code>%ed</code>/<code>%edit</code>:</p>

<p>An example of what you can do:</p>

<pre><code>In [72]: %ed
IPython will make a temporary file named: c:\docume~1\wjwe312\locals~1\temp\ipython_edit_ar8veu.py
</code></pre>

<p>In the file I put:</p>

<pre><code>x = "Hello World"
print 3
</code></pre>

<p>After saving and quitting the file:</p>

<pre><code>Editing... done. Executing edited code...
3
Out[72]: "x = 'Hello world'\nprint 3\n"

In [73]: x
Out[73]: 'Hello world'
</code></pre>

<p>You can define functions or anything else - just remember that the contents of the file will be executed when you close it.</p>

<p>Another similar workflow is to <code>cd</code> to the directory containing your Python script that you're editing with your favorite editor. Then you can <code>%run</code> the script from within IPython and you'll have access to everything defined in the file. For instance, if you have the following in the file <code>test.py</code> in your <code>/home/myself</code> directory:</p>

<pre><code>    class Tester(object):
        def __init__(self):
            print "hi"

    def knightme(name):
        print "Hello, Sir ", name
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can do the following:</p>

<pre><code>In [42]: cd /home/myself
/home/myself

In [43]: %run test.py # &lt;Tab&gt; autocomplete also works

In [44]: knightme('John')
Hello, Sir  John

In [45]: t = Tester()
Hi
</code></pre>

<p>Either a mix or one of those workflows should give you something very similar to the way you're used to working in IDLE.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/spyderlib/" rel="nofollow">SPyderlib</a> a.k.a Spyder2</p>

<p>Pretty lightweight, fast and support almost all features you will ever need to work with a python project.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Take a look at <a href="http://dreampie.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">DreamPie</a>. Might be what you are looking for.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>1, Try the combination of Spyder and Vim.</p>

<p>I edit python files in Vim, then run them in Spyder (in the same interpreter, which is important for me).</p>

<p>Spyder can reload the file automatically. 
Use F9 to run the current file and Ctrl+F9 to run the selected block. )</p>

<p>2, Recently I come across a Vim plugin, conque-shell. If you'd like to work in a manner like Matlab, then probably you should try it. </p>

<p>Just open your preferred Python interpreter using "ConqueTerm", then visual select the some code, press  to paste it in the Python interpreter. </p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Personally, I like <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pyscripter/" rel="nofollow">PyScripter</a>. Unfortunately, it only works on Windows, but also runs perfectly in Wine. </p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Personally, I use what @Wayne suggested, a combination of vim and ipython...</p>

<p>However, if you'd prefer a different approach, take a look at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/spyderlib/" rel="nofollow">spyder</a>. </p>

<p>As of the latest version (1.1) ipython should be fully integrated.  If you download an earlier version, things will work fine with ipython as an external shell, but you won't get a few of spyder's nifty features (like viewing all of the currently defined variables in the workspace window). </p>

<p>Spyder is definitely a bit heavyweight, but it's an interesting project.</p>

<p>Another (very, very, new) similar project to take a look at is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/iep/" rel="nofollow">iep</a>.  It will (sort-of) work with ipython as shell, and I'd be willing to be bet that nicer ipython integration will be along before too long.  At any rate, iep is essentially a more lightweight alternative to spyder.</p>

<p>Both of these are oriented towards scientific computing, and so have nice integration with things like matplotlib (and thus can automatically run gui main loops in a seperate thread). They're not quite like "normal" IDE's but they may fill the niche you're looking for quite nicely.  </p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>You might like <a href="http://code.google.com/p/wxpysuite/" rel="nofollow">PySlices</a>...</p>

<p>It's kind of a shell/editor hybrid that lets you save your session as special (barely) modified python files called .pyslice files.</p>

<p>It's now part of <a href="http://www.wxpython.org/download.php" rel="nofollow">wxPython</a>, so just install that (v2.8.11 or later) and run "python -m wx.py.PySlices" on the command line to launch it.</p>

<p>That said, I still end up using an external editor for scripts (geany).</p>
