<h3>Question (ID-4622234):</h3><h2>How to convert a list to a csv in python</h2><p>I have a list: ['1','2','3'] and want to convert it to 1,2,3 i.e. no brackets or quotation marks.</p>

<hr>

<p>Example from the docs:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import csv
&gt;&gt;&gt; spamWriter = csv.writer(open('eggs.csv', 'wb'), delimiter=' ',
...                         quotechar='|', quoting=csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL)
&gt;&gt;&gt; spamWriter.writerow(['Spam'] * 5 + ['Baked Beans'])
&gt;&gt;&gt; spamWriter.writerow(['Spam', 'Lovely Spam', 'Wonderful Spam'])
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><pre><code>",".join(lst)
</code></pre>

<p>will do it, but that's not really csv (would need escaping and such).</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><pre><code>import csv

def writeCsvFile(fname, data, *args, **kwargs):
    """
    @param fname: string, name of file to write
    @param data: list of list of items

    Write data to file
    """
    mycsv = csv.writer(open(fname, 'wb'), *args, **kwargs)
    for row in data:
        mycsv.writerow(row)

mydat = (
    ['Name','Age','Grade'],
    ['Teri', 14, 7],
    ['John', 8, 2]
)

writeCsvFile(r'c:\test.csv', mydat)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I have the following:</p>

<p>csvwriter = csv.writer(open('test.csv', 'wb'))
for item in pct:
    csvwriter.writerow(item) </p>

<p>The test.csv file is empty.  Is my nomenclature wrong?    </p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Carl, whenever you write data into a file what Python actually does is buffer the data and then does its I/O operation with the file (writing the data into the file). This operation is called 'flushing' (the buffers). You have to make sure you are close()ing the opened file, if not, buffer won't be flushed and thus you won't have anything written in the file.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Thanks.
so for my code:</p>

<p>csvwriter = csv.writer(open('test.csv', 'wb'))
for item in pct:
    csvwriter.writerow(item)</p>

<p>I need to add?
csvwriter.close()</p>

<p>It didn't like that.....</p>
