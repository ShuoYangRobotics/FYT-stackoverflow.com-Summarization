<h3>Question (ID-2069662):</h3><h2>How to exit an if clause</h2><p>What sorts of methods exist for prematurely exiting an <code>if</code> clause? </p>

<p>There are times when I'm writing code and want to put a <code>break</code> statement inside of an <code>if</code> clause, only to remember that those can only be used for loops.</p>

<p>Lets take the following code as an example:</p>

<pre><code>if some_condition:
   ...
   if condition_a:
       # do something
       # and then exit the outer if block
   ...
   if condition_b:
       # do something
       # and then exit the outer if block
   # more code here
</code></pre>

<p>I can think of one way to do this: assuming the exit cases happen within nested if statements, wrap the remaining code in a big else block. Example:</p>

<pre><code>if some_condition:
   ...
   if condition_a:
       # do something
       # and then exit the outer if block
   else:
       ...
       if condition_b:
           # do something
           # and then exit the outer if block
       else:
           # more code here
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with this is that more exit locations mean more nesting/indented code.</p>

<p>Alternatively, I could write my code to have the <code>if</code> clauses be as small as possible and not require any exits.</p>

<p>Does anyone know of a good/better way to exit an <code>if</code> clause?</p>

<p>If there are any associated else-if and else clauses, I figure that exiting would skip over them. </p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>This method works for <code>if</code>s, multiple nested loops and other constructs that you can't <code>break</code> from easily.</p>

<p>Wrap the code in its own function.  Instead of <code>break</code>, <code>return</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><pre>
from <a href="http://entrian.com/goto/" rel="nofollow">goto</a> import goto, label

if some_condition:
   ...
   if condition_a:
       # do something
       # and then exit the outer if block
       goto .end
   ...
   if condition_b:
       # do something
       # and then exit the outer if block
       goto .end
   # more code here

label .end
</pre>

<p>(Don't actually use this, please.)</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You can emulate goto's functionality with exceptions:</p>

<pre><code>try:
    # blah, blah ...
    # raise MyFunkyException as soon as you want out
except MyFunkyException:
    pass
</code></pre>

<p>Disclaimer: I only mean to bring to your attention the <em>possibility</em> of doing things this way, while in no way do I endorse it as reasonable under normal circumstances. As I mentioned in a comment on the question, structuring code so as to avoid Byzantine conditionals in the first place is preferable by far. :-)</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>may be this?</p>

<pre><code>if some_condition and condition_a:
       # do something
elif some_condition and condition_b:
           # do something
           # and then exit the outer if block
elif some_condition and not condition_b:
           # more code here
else:
     #blah
if
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Effectively what you're describing are goto statements, which are generally panned pretty heavily. Your second example is far easier to understand. </p>

<p>However, cleaner still would be:</p>

<pre><code>if some_condition:
   ...
   if condition_a:
       your_function1()
   else:
       your_function2()

...

def your_function2():
   if condition_b:
       # do something
       # and then exit the outer if block
   else:
       # more code here
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><pre><code>while some_condition:
   ...
   if condition_a:
       # do something
       break
   ...
   if condition_b:
       # do something
       break
   # more code here
   break
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Generally speaking, don't. If you are nesting "ifs" and breaking from them, you are doing it wrong.</p>

<p>However, if you must:</p>

<pre><code>if condition_a:
   def condition_a_fun():
       do_stuff()
       if we_wanna_escape:
           return
   condition_a_fun()
if condition_b:
   def condition_b_fun():
       do_more_stuff()
       if we_wanna_get_out_again:
           return
   condition_b_fun()
</code></pre>

<p>Note, the functions don't HAVE to be declared in the if statement, they can be declared in advance ;) This would be a better choice, since it will avoid needing to refactor out an ugly if/then later on.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>I don't like the whole idea of structuring code this way. I fear it leads to the same problems as using <code>goto</code> statements. (luckily, Python has not goto statement).</p>
