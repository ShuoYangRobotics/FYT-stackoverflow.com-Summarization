<h3>Question (ID-3489038):</h3><h2>Looking for beginner Python project ideas to learn the language</h2><p>I've read through "Python for Dummies" and I'm ready to take the next step. I hear that practicing coding with the goal of creating something is the best way to learn. I'm a beginner in Python, and I'm looking for project ideas that I should attempt.</p>

<p>I'm looking to learn web app programming, so any project that would teach me this area would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>I'd also like to send my code to anyone who proposes a project for me so I could get feedback.</p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>try <a href="http://projecteuler.net/" rel="nofollow">http://projecteuler.net/</a>  It is a little math heavy, but not too bad.  </p>

<p>Also try something that requires reading from and writing to files.  Something that requires parsing, and something that requires network behavior, like pulling a web page.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Look at django the web framework for python and develop little web applications. This is what ive done, and im learning python as it looked cool from just using it. </p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I learned Python web development with <a href="http://turbogears.org/" rel="nofollow">TurboGears</a> (which now seems to have left all of its momentum in favour of <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/" rel="nofollow">Django</a>) creating an ebook management app. It was a great exercise and I will surely recommend it.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>If your looking for something small I find doing classic CS problems a good learning tool.  For example you could implement a Primes iterator using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.</p>
