<h3>Question (ID-4225921):</h3><h2>Execute (part of) try block after except block</h2><p>I know that is a weird question, and probably there is not an answer.
I'm trying to execute the rest of the try block after an exception was caught and the except block was executed.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>[...]
try:
 do.this()
 do.that()
 [...]
except:
 foo.bar()
[...]
</code></pre>

<p><code>do.this()</code> raise an exception managed by <code>foo.bar()</code>, then I would like to execute the code from <code>do.that()</code>. I know that there is not a GOTO statement, but maybe some kind of hack or workaround!</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>A <code>try... except...</code> block catches <em>one</em> exception. That's what it's for. It executes the code inside the try, and if an exception is raised, handles it in the except. You can't raise multiple exceptions inside the try.</p>

<p>This is deliberate: the point of the construction is that you need <strong>explicitly</strong> to handle the exceptions that occur. Returning to the end of the <code>try</code> violates this, because then the <code>except</code> statement handles more than one thing.</p>

<p>You should do:</p>

<pre><code>try:
    do.this()
except FailError:
    clean.up()

try:
    do.that()
except FailError:
    clean.up()
</code></pre>

<p>so that any exception you raise is handled explicitly.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Use a finally block?  Am I missing something?</p>

<pre><code>   [...] 
    try: 
     do.this() 
    except: 
     foo.bar() 
    [...] 
    finally:
     do.that()
     [...] 
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If you always need to execute <code>foo.bar()</code> why not just move it after the try/except block? Or maybe even to a <code>finally:</code> block.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You need two try blocks, one for each statement in your current try block.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>One possibility is to write a code in such a way that you can re-execute it all when the error condition has been solved, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>while 1:
   try:
      complex_operation()
   except X:
      solve_problem()
      continue
   break
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>This doesn't scale up well, but for smaller blocks of code you could use a classic finite-state-machine:</p>

<pre><code>states = [do.this, do.that]
state = 0
while state &lt; len(states):
    try:
        states[state]()
    except:
        foo.bar()
    state += 1
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><pre><code>fcts = [do.this, do.that]
for fct in fcts:
    try:
        fct()
    except:
        foo.bar()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Here's another alternative. Handle the error condition with a callback, so that after fixing the problem you can continue. The callback would basically contain exactly the same code you would put in the <code>except</code> block.</p>

<p>As a silly example, let's say that the exception you want to handle is a missing file, and that you have a way to deal with that problem (a default file or whatever). <code>fileRetriever</code> is the callback that knows how to deal with the problem. Then you would write:</p>

<pre><code>def myOp(fileRetriever):

    f = acquireFile()
    if not f:
        f = fileRetriever()

    # continue with your stuff...

    f2 = acquireAnotherFile()
    if not f2:
        f2 = fileRetriever()

    # more stuff...


myOp(magicalCallback)
</code></pre>

<p>Note: I've never seen this design used in practice, but in specific situations I guess it might be usable.</p>
