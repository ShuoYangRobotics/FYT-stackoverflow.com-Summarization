<h3>Question (ID-839660):</h3><h2>Looking for interesting and instructive python code (web programming)</h2><p>I'm learning python and my current focus is on web programming.  Thx to some help from stackoverflow, I recently made some reasonable progress.  While still at basic level, I can now "somewhat" comfortably use html templates, web frameworks (haven't done anything significant yet), sqlite (no mySQL yet), etc.</p>

<p>Before I start another project, I'd like to review some interesting/instructive code (web UI).  I have been searching at all the normal places but this process is very hit or miss.</p>

<p>If anyone has code and/or links to code that they believe would help me further my education, I would be most appreciative if they would post here.</p>

<p>As an aside, I have started using the twitter APIs (easy/fun source of a ton of data) - so any code that fits the bill and uses Twitter is a bonus.</p>

<p>Thx!!</p>

<p>Update: to be clear, I'm looking more for examples like: <a href="http://code.reddit.com/" rel="nofollow">http://code.reddit.com/</a> (source code for reddit).  This example is beyond my abilities but is interesting nonetheless.</p>

<p>Dive Into Python has been freely available for a while now.  Great starting point.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Here are some good places to start:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/" rel="nofollow">Django source</a><br />
  <a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/DjangoResources" rel="nofollow">Django resources</a></p>
</blockquote>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Have a look at <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/" rel="nofollow">Trac</a>, there's some pretty instructive code in there. Just don't try to understand how its component architecture works underneath on your first read ;-)</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The code from the excellent book Programming Collective Intelligence can be found here:</p>

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Maybe not that elegant to use as django, but definitely worth a look because of clever use of the Python language: <a href="http://webpy.org/" rel="nofollow">webpy</a></p>

<p>Just one of the many praises on its web site:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Guido [van Rossum, creator of Python], you'll probably find that web.py best suits your style. ... If you don't like it, I can't imagine which of the other dozens of frameworks out there you would like." 
   - Phillip J. Eby, creator of the Python Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) </p>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Some code that I'm looking:</p>

<p>From Django Practical Projects book, the code(not complete) of the weblog: <a href="http://bitbucket.org/ubernostrum/practical-django-projects/src/" rel="nofollow">http://bitbucket.org/ubernostrum/practical-django-projects/src/</a></p>

<p>I hope it helps,</p>

<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>What about <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jaikuengine/" rel="nofollow">JaikuEngine</a>  </p>

<p><img src="http://www.jaiku.com/themes/classic/logo-big.gif" alt="alt text"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>JaikuEngine is a social microblogging platform that runs on AppEngine.</em></p>

<p>This is the source code for <a href="http://www.jaiku.com/" rel="nofollow">jaiku.com</a> and the code is first class. </p>

<p>Definitive a guide for python webdevelopment specially with app engine.</p>
