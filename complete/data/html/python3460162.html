<h3>Question (ID-3460162):</h3><h2>Python + and * operators</h2><p>I'm working my way through some code examples and I stumbled upon this:</p>

<pre><code>endings = ['st', 'nd', 'rd'] + 17 * ['th'] + ['st', 'nd', 'rd'] + 7 * ['th']
+ ['st']
</code></pre>

<p>I understand that for numbers after 4 and until 20 they end in 'th' and I can see that we are adding 17 more items to the list, and I understand that '17 * ['th'] is adding 'th' to the list 17 times, however, I don't understand how this works.</p>

<p>Can you shed some light on this?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p><code>17 * ['th']</code> generates <code>['th', 'th', ..., 'th']</code> (17 items).</p>

<p>In addition it's worth noting 2 behaviours:</p>

<ul>
<li>That this is only really useful because the contents <code>'th'</code> is immutable (unless of course you never intended to modify the ending list).</li>
<li>The list object <code>['th']</code> is only created once, however it is extended by iterating over the original copy 17 times, appending each entry to the final <code>['th', ...]</code> list. This in turn is merged with the surrounding endings via the <code>+</code> operator.</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't normally shed my light. Only about once every 6 months. If you see it lying about don't tell anyone it's mine.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The + operator returns the 'sum' of 2 list, or both of them concatenated together. The * operator returns a list added to itself X times.</p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>When multiplying a list, you're creating a new list containing the elements of the list that many times.  In this case, <code>17 * ['th']</code> creates a list containing seventeen strings <code>'th'</code>.  When adding lists together, you're creating a new list containing the elements of all operands.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1, 2]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a * 2
[1, 2, 1, 2]

&gt;&gt;&gt; a = ['th']
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = ['st']
&gt;&gt;&gt; 3 * a + b
['th', 'th', 'th', 'st']
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The part of the code <code>17 * ['th']</code> creates a list with 17 items that are all <code>'th'</code> and the + operator concatenates the list together, so <code>['st', 'nd', 'rd'] + 17 * ['th']</code> would become <code>['st', 'nd', 'rd', 'th', 'th', 'th', 'th', 'th', 'th', 'th', 'th', 'th', 'th', 'th', 'th', 'th', 'th', 'th', 'th', 'th']</code></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>That makes the following list:</p>

<pre><code>endings = [ "st", "nd", "rd", "th", "th", "th", "th", "th", "th", "th", "th", "th", "th", "th", "th", "th", "th", "th", "th", "th", "st", "nd", "rd", "th", "th", "th", "th", "th", "th", "th" ]
</code></pre>

<p>So if you want to write "21st", do</p>

<pre><code>"{0}{1}".format( 21, endings[ 20 ] )
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that the list is off by one, since <code>endings[0]</code> is the first element.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Consider 
twentieth
twenty first
twenty second
twenty third
...
thirtieth
thirty first</p>

<p>Or is it something else that you don't understand about it?</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Additionally, you can override the operators of your own objects e.g.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
# encoding: utf-8

class SomeClass(object):
    def __init__(self, v):
        self.value = v

    def __add__(self, b):
        return self.value + b.value

def main():
    a = SomeClass(1)
    b = SomeClass(2)
    print a + b


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</code></pre>
