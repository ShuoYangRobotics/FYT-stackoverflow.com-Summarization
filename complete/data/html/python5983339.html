<h3>Question (ID-5983339):</h3><h2>why am I getting a 'closed file' message when I run my python script?</h2><p>simple bit of code, just prints out a list of urls I put into a text file (it was printing them with the \n char at the end of each one though - how do I get rid of the \n?):</p>

<pre><code>import mechanize, fileinput

with open('F:\Python\url_list2.txt') as urls:
    content = urls.readlines()
print content
</code></pre>

<p>anyway, it worked printed out the list, great. Run it again and I get this message in the python shell:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;closed file 'F:\Python\url_list2.txt', mode 'r' at 0x0000000002E4E390&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>What is going on? Using windows 7 x64 if that makes any difference?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p><code>with</code> only keeps the file open within the indentation block.  Try:</p>

<pre><code>import mechanize, fileinput

with open('F:\Python\url_list2.txt') as urls:
    content = urls.readlines()
    print urls # file still open.
print content
</code></pre>

<p>Basically <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/compound_stmts.html#index-812" rel="nofollow">with</a> is syntactic sugar for a common <code>try except finally</code> pattern:</p>

<pre><code>try:
    urls = open('F:\Python\url_list2.txt')
    # rest of indented block
finally:
    urls.close()
# stuff outside of indented block
</code></pre>

<p>So your code translates into:</p>

<pre><code>import mechanize, fileinput
try:
    urls = open('F:\Python\url_list2.txt')
    # rest of indented block
    content = urls.readlines()
finally:
    urls.close()
# stuff outside of indented block.
print urls
</code></pre>

<p>So you see why you urls is reported as a closed file ... you just closed it by exiting the <code>with</code> indentation block.  You probably want to <code>print content</code> to see the <code>content</code> you loaded into the variable from the closed <code>urls</code> file.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Try print content  (urls is gone after with closes.)</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Maybe you want to be printing <code>content</code> instead of <code>urls</code>?</p>

<p>To remove the newlines, use <code>rstrip</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>When you use <code>with</code>, this is what is actually happening:</p>

<pre><code>with open(filepath) as f:
    # do stuff
print "YAY"
# do more stuff
</code></pre>

<p>The above is equivalent to saying:</p>

<pre><code>f = open(filepath)
try:
    # do stuff
except:
    f.close()
finally:
    f.close()
    print "YAY"
    # do more stuff
</code></pre>

<p>Does this explain why you are getting that error?</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Presumably a file object you've already called close() on? Can we see your code?</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>The <code>with</code> statement automatically closes the handle after all the statements inside it execute. If you need access to the handle afterwards:</p>

<pre><code>import mechanize, fileinput

urls = open('F:\Python\url_list2.txt')
content = urls.readlines()
print content
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to get rid of the <code>\n</code> at the end of every line, use <code>.strip()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>import mechanize, fileinput

urls = open('F:\Python\url_list2.txt')
content = [x.strip() for x in urls.readlines()]
print content
</code></pre>
