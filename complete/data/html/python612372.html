<h3>Question (ID-612372):</h3><h2>Can you give a Django app a verbose name for use throughout the admin?</h2><p>In the same way that you can give fields and models verbose names that appear in the Django admin, can you give an app a custom name?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-9):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You can give your application a custom name by defining app_label in your model definition. But as django builds the admin page it will hash models by their app_label, so if you want them to appear in one application, you have to define this name in all models of your application.</p>

<pre><code>class MyModel(models.Model):
        pass
    class Meta:
        app_label = 'My APP name'
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>No, but you can copy admin template and define app name there.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Give them a verbose_name property.</p>

<p>Don't get your hopes up. You will also need to copy the index view from django.contrib.admin.sites into your own ProjectAdminSite view and include it in your own custom admin instance:</p>

<pre><code>class ProjectAdminSite(AdminSite):
    def index(self, request, extra_context=None):
        copied stuff here...

admin.site = ProjectAdminSite()
</code></pre>

<p>then tweak the copied view so that it uses your verbose_name property as the label for the app.</p>

<p>I did it by adding something a bit like this to the copied view:</p>

<pre><code>        try:
            app_name = model_admin.verbose_name
        except AttributeError:
            app_name = app_label
</code></pre>

<p>While you are tweaking the index view why not add an 'order' property too.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Well I started an app called <strong>todo</strong> and have now decided I want it to be named <strong>Tasks</strong>. The problem is that I already have data within my table so my work around was as follows. Placed into the models.py:</p>

<pre><code>    class Meta:
       app_label = 'Tasks'
       db_table = 'mytodo_todo'
</code></pre>

<p>Hope it helps.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>If you have more than one model in the app just create a model with the Meta information and create subclasses of that class for all your models.</p>

<pre><code>class MyAppModel(models.Model):
    class Meta:
        app_label = 'My App Label'

class Category(MyAppModel):
     name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I'm using <a href="https://bitbucket.org/izi/django-admin-tools/" rel="nofollow">django-admin-tools</a> for that.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>For Django 1.4 (not yet released, but trunk is pretty stable), you can use the following method. It relies on the fact that AdminSite now returns a TemplateResponse, which you can alter before it is rendered.</p>

<p>Here, we do a small bit of monkey patching to insert our behaviour, which can be avoided if you use a custom AdminSite subclass.</p>

<pre><code>from functools import wraps
def rename_app_list(func):
    m = {'Sites': 'Web sites',
         'Your_app_label': 'Nicer app label',
    }

    @wraps(func)
    def _wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        response = func(*args, **kwargs)
        app_list = response.context_data.get('app_list')

        if app_list is not None:
            for a in app_list:
                name = a['name']
                a['name'] = m.get(name, name)
        title = response.context_data.get('title')
        if title is not None:
            app_label = title.split(' ')[0]
            if app_label in m:
                response.context_data['title'] = "%s administration" % m[app_label]
        return response
    return _wrapper

admin.site.__class__.index = rename_app_list(admin.site.__class__.index)
admin.site.__class__.app_index = rename_app_list(admin.site.__class__.app_index)
</code></pre>

<p>This fixes the index and the app_index views. It doesn't fix the bread crumbs in all other admin views.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>It would be nice to be able to set the applications verbose_name in either it's <strong>init</strong>.py or admin.py file.  So the <strong>init</strong>.py file in your applications directory could look like:</p>

<pre><code>class Meta:
    verbose_name = 'My Django App'
</code></pre>

<p>Django 1.2 maybe?</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>You can't give apps a custom name (at the moment at least; I believe this is going to be addressed at some point), but you can <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/models/#verbose-field-names" rel="nofollow">give your fields a 
"display name"</a> by passing the <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/fields/#verbose-name" rel="nofollow"><code>verbose_name</code></a> keyword argument to your fields (this is also conveniently the first positonal argument).</p>

<p>So, you can do either:</p>

<pre><code>address = models.CharField(blank=False, max_length=250, verbose_name='Address (Line 1)')
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>address = models.CharField('Address (Line 1)', blank=False, max_length=250)
</code></pre>

<p>â€¦and the admin will display these "pretty" versions instead.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if you're saying you know this already or not, but if not, you can give your models custom names too, also with the <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/options/#verbose-name" rel="nofollow"><code>verbose_name</code></a> (and <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/options/#verbose-name-plural" rel="nofollow"><code>verbose_name_plural</code></a>) properties in <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/models/#meta-options" rel="nofollow">the model's <code>Meta</code> class</a>, like:</p>

<pre><code>class ModelName(models.Model):
    # your model definition here

    class Meta:
        verbose_name = 'verbose model name'
        verbose_name_plural = 'plural verbose model name'
</code></pre>
