<h3>Question (ID-4792065):</h3><h2>Programmatically converting/parsing LaTeX code to plain text</h2><p>I have a couple of code projects in C++/Python in which LaTeX-format descriptions and labels are used to generate PDF documentation or graphs made using LaTeX+pstricks. However, we also have some plain text outputs, such as an HTML version of the documentation (I already have code to write minimal markup for that) and a non-TeX-enabled plot renderer.</p>

<p>For these I would like to eliminate the TeX markup that is necessary for e.g. representing physical units. This includes non-breaking (thin) spaces, \text, \mathrm etc. It would also be nice to parse down things like \frac{#1}{#2} into #1/#2 for the plain text output (and use MathJax for the HTML). Due to the system that we've got at the moment, I need to be able to do this from Python, i.e. <em>ideally</em> I'm looking for a Python package, but a non-Python executable which I can call from Python and catch the output string would also be fine.</p>

<p>I'm aware of the <a href="http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/6431/options-for-converting-latex-to-plain-text">similar question on the TeX StackExchange site</a>, but there weren't any really programmatic solutions to that: I've looked at detex, plasTeX and pytex, which they all seem a bit dead and don't really do what I need: programmatic conversion of a TeX string to a representative plain text string.</p>

<p>I could try writing a basic TeX parser using e.g. pyparsing, but a) that might be pitfall-laden and help would be appreciated and b) surely someone has tried that before, or knows of a way to hook into TeX itself to get a better result?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Thanks for all the answers... it does indeed seem to be a bit of an awkward request! I can make do with less than general parsing of LaTeX, but the reason for considering a parser rather than a load of regexes in a loop is that I want to be able to handle nested macros and multi-arg macros nicely, and get the brace matching to work properly. Then I can e.g. reduce txt-irrelevant macros like \text and \mathrm first, and handle txt-relevant ones like \frac last... maybe even with appropriate parentheses! Well, I can dream... for now regexes are not doing such a terrible job.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>A word of caution: It is much more difficult to write a complete parser for plain TeX than what you might think.  The TeX-level (not LaTeX) <code>\def</code> command actually extends TeX's syntax.  For example, <code>\def\foo #1.{{\bf #1}}</code> will expand <code>\foo goo.</code> into <strong>goo</strong> - Notice that the dot became a delimiter for the foo macro!  Therefore, if you have to deal with <em>any</em> form of TeX, without restrictions on which packages may be used, it is not recommended to rely on simple parsing.  You need TeX rendering.  <a href="http://catdvi.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">catdvi</a> is what I use, although it is not perfect.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Try <code>detex</code> (shipped with most *TeX distributions), or the improved version: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/opendetex/" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/opendetex/</a></p>

<p>Edit: oh, I see you tried detex already. Still, opendetex might work for you.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>As you're considering using TeX itself for doing the rendering, I suspect that performance is not an issue. In this case you've got a couple of options: dvi2txt to fetch your text from a single dvi file (be prepared to generate one for each label) or even rendering dvi into raster images, if it's ok for you - that's how hevea or latex2html treats formulas.</p>

<p>This is your mistake.  You shouldn't have done that.</p>

<p>Use RST or some other -- better -- markup language.</p>

<p>Use <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">Docutils</a> to create LaTeX and HTML from the RST source.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I would try pandoc [enter link description here][1]. It is written in Haskell, but it is a really nice latex 2 whatever converter.  </p>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Building the other post Eduardo Leoni, I was looking at pandoc and I see that it comes with a standalone executable but also on <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/extras.html" rel="nofollow">this page</a> it promises a way to build to a C-callable system library. Perhaps this is something that you can live with?</p>
