<pre><code>$result=shell_exec('application_name [parameters] input-file output-file')
</code></pre>

<p>for example you can use <strong><a href="http://ffmpeg.org/" rel="nofollow">ffmpeg</a></strong></p>

<pre><code>$result=shell_exec('ffmpeg -i myfile.avi -target vcd /tmp/vcd.mpg')
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ffdshow/" rel="nofollow">ffdshow</a> is a great lib for that. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.afterdawn.com/glossary/terms/libavcodec.cfm" rel="nofollow">libavcodec</a> to be more precise.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Use <a href="http://github.com/polly/ffmpeg/" rel="nofollow">FFmpeg</a> gem in Ruby, it's really cool and easy to use.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Take a look at <a href="http://ffmpeg.org/" rel="nofollow">FFmpeg</a>. You could use as a command line tool.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>In the past, I ran <a href="http://www.videolan.org/" rel="nofollow">VLC</a> from the command-line and used it to do my conversions (it's free, supports nearly all audio and video formats, and works on many different platforms).  If you have VLC installed on the server, you can access it this way using any language that has a <code>system()</code> command or equivalent.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Or if you want something to use directly from Java, try <a href="http://www.xuggle.com/xuggler" rel="nofollow">Xuggler</a>, a Java-based interface to <a href="http://ffmpeg.org/" rel="nofollow">FFmpeg</a>.</p>
