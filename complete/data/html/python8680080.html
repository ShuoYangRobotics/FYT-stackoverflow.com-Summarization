<h3>Question (ID-8680080):</h3><h2>Why are Python string immutable? Best practices of using them</h2><ol>
<li>What are the design reasons of making Python strings immutable? How does it make programming easier?</li>
<li>I'm used to mutable strings, like the ones in C. How am I supposed to program without mutable strings? Are there any best practices?</li>
</ol>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>When you receive a string, you'll be sure that it stays the same. Suppose that you'd construct a <code>Foo</code> as below with a string argument, and would then modify the string; then the <code>Foo</code>'s name would suddenly change:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo(object):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

name = "Hello"
foo = Foo(name)
name[0] = "J"
</code></pre>

<p>With mutable strings, you'd have to make copies all the time to prevent bad things from happening.</p>

<p>It also allows the convenience that a single character is no different from a string of length one, so all string operators apply to characters as well.</p>

<p>And lastly, if strings weren't immutable, you couldn't reliably stick them in a <code>dict</code>, since their hash value might suddenly change.</p>

<p>As for programming with immutable strings, just get used to treating them the same way you treat numbers: as <em>values</em>, not as objects. Changing the first letter of <code>name</code> would be</p>

<pre><code>name = "J" + name[1:]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><strong><a href="http://effbot.org/pyfaq/why-are-python-strings-immutable.htm" rel="nofollow">Here</a></strong> is the answer to the first part of your question which is related to <strong>Python Strings</strong></p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><ol>
<li>Immutable objects are automatically threadsafe.</li>
<li><strike>The .net string is immutable.</strike> OK, you meant C rather than C#. Well, you will find that using Python strings is trivially easy in comparison to the extreme pain associated with strings in C.</li>
</ol>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Immutable strings can be keys in dictionaries and similar data structures, without the need to copy the strings. It is easier to make a mutable wrapper around an immutable string than the other way around.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Immutable strings makes programming much easier, which is why C# and Java use them too.</p>

<p>Had strings been mutable, you would not be able to trust any externally-provided string, since a malicious caller could change it underneath you.<br>
It would also make multi-threading much more difficult.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Most languages have immutable strings.  This includes Java, Python, and C#.  Usually when concatenating strings, the language allocates an entirely new string and copies the content of the two strings into the new string.</p>

<p>Immutability does tend to make programming easier.  Especially when dealing with a multi-threaded environment.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Immutable strings greatly simplify memory allocation when compared with C strings: you don't guess at a length and over-allocate hoping you over-allocated enough.</p>

<p>They're more secure: you can <strong>never</strong> have a buffer overrun the way you can in C. </p>

<p>There is only one mutable string use case.</p>

<ul>
<li>replacing a substring or a single character</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>All</strong> other string use cases (concatenation, searching, etc., etc.) the mutability does not matter. In all other cases, mutability does not matter.</p>

<p>If you want to replace a character or a substring in Python, you simply create a new string</p>

<pre><code>x = x[:place] + replacement + x[place+1:]
</code></pre>

<p>That's the only code that novel or distinctive.</p>

<hr>

<p>For reasons I fail to understand, it appears important to add the following.</p>

<p>"There are other ways to avoid a string buffer overflow than immutable strings."</p>

<p>For the purposes of this question (about Python, specifically) immutable strings have a pleasant consequence of no buffer overflows.  For other languages, other principles, rules and nuances apply.</p>
