<h3>Question (ID-1006169):</h3><h2>How do I look inside a Python object?</h2><p>I'm starting to code in various projects using Python (including Django web development and Panda3D game development). To help me understand whats going on, I would like to basically 'look' inside the Python objects to see how they tick - like their methods and properties. So say I have a Python object, what could would I need to print out it's contents? Is that even possible?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Take a look at the following <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html" rel="nofollow">built-in functions</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>type()</li>
<li>dir()</li>
<li>id()</li>
<li>getattr()</li>
<li>hasattr()</li>
<li>globals()</li>
<li>locals()</li>
<li>callable()</li>
</ul>

<p>type() and dir() are particularly useful for inspecting the type of an object and its set of attributes, respectively.</p>

<p>Here is an online resource worth perusing:
<a href="http://www.diveintopython.org/power%5Fof%5Fintrospection/index.html" rel="nofollow">Dive Into Python Chapter 4: The Power of Introspection</a></p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>First, read the source.</p>

<p>Second, use the <code>dir()</code> function.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If this is for exploration to see what's going on, I'd recommend looking at <a href="http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/" rel="nofollow">IPython</a>.  This adds various shortcuts to obtain an objects documentation, properties and even source code.  For instance appending a "?" to a function will give the help for the object (effectively a shortcut for "help(obj)", wheras using two ?'s ("<code>func??</code>") will display the sourcecode if it is available.</p>

<p>There are also a lot of additional conveniences, like tab completion, pretty printing of results, result history etc. that make it very handy for this sort of exploratory programming.</p>

<p>For more programmatic use of introspection, the basic builtins like <code>dir()</code>, <code>vars()</code>, <code>getattr</code> etc will be useful, but it is well worth your time to check out the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/inspect.html" rel="nofollow">inspect</a> module.  To fetch the source of a function, use "<code>inspect.getsource</code>"  eg, applying it to itself:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print inspect.getsource(inspect.getsource)
def getsource(object):
    """Return the text of the source code for an object.

    The argument may be a module, class, method, function, traceback, frame,
    or code object.  The source code is returned as a single string.  An
    IOError is raised if the source code cannot be retrieved."""
    lines, lnum = getsourcelines(object)
    return string.join(lines, '')
</code></pre>

<p><code>inspect.getargspec</code> is also frequently useful if you're dealing with wrapping or manipulating functions, as it will give the names and default values of function parameters.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You can list the attributes of a object with dir() in the shell:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; dir(object())
['__class__', '__delattr__', '__doc__', '__format__', '__getattribute__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__setattr__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__']
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, there is also the inspect module: <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/inspect.html#module-inspect" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/library/inspect.html#module-inspect</a></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>pprint and dir together work great</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p><code>object.__dict__</code></p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Others have already mentioned the dir() built-in which sounds like what you're looking for, but here's another good tip.  Many libraries -- including most of the standard library -- are distributed in source form.  Meaning you can pretty easily read the source code directly.  The trick is in finding it; for example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import string
&gt;&gt;&gt; string.__file__
'/usr/lib/python2.5/string.pyc'
</code></pre>

<p>The *.pyc file is compiled, so remove the trailing 'c' and open up the uncompiled *.py file in your favorite editor or file viewer:</p>

<pre><code>/usr/lib/python2.5/string.py
</code></pre>

<p>I've found this incredibly useful for discovering things like which exceptions are raised from a given API.  This kind of detail is rarely well-documented in the Python world.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>I'm surprised no one's mentioned help yet!</p>

<pre><code>In [1]: def foo():
   ...:     "foo!"
   ...:

In [2]: help(foo)
Help on function foo in module __main__:

foo()
    foo!
</code></pre>

<p>Help lets you read the docstring and get an idea of what attributes a class might have, which is pretty helpful.</p>

def info(object, spacing=10, collapse=1):
    """Print methods and doc strings.

<pre><code>Takes module, class, list, dictionary, or string."""
methodList = [e for e in dir(object) if callable(getattr(object, e))]
processFunc = collapse and (lambda s: " ".join(s.split())) or (lambda s: s)

<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>In addition if you want to look inside list and dictionaries, you can use pprint()</p>
<br /><b>#10</b><br /><p>If you want to look at parameters and methods, as others have pointed out you may well use <code>pprint</code> or <code>dir()</code></p>

<p>If you want to see the actual value of the contents, you can do</p>

<p><code>object.__dict__</code></p>
