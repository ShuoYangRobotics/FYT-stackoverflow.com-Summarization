<h3>Question (ID-3718657):</h3><h2>How to properly determine current script directory in Python?</h2><p>I would like to see what is best way to determine current script directory in python?</p>

<p>I discovered that two to the many ways of calling python code, it is hard to find a good solution.</p>

<p>Here are some problems:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>__file__</code> is not defined if the script is executed with <code>exec</code>, <code>execfile</code></li>
<li><code>__module__</code> is defined only in modules</li>
</ul>

<p>Use cases: </p>

<ul>
<li><code>./myfile.py</code></li>
<li><code>python myfile.py</code></li>
<li><code>./somedir/myfile.py</code></li>
<li><code>python somedir/myfile.py</code></li>
<li><code>execfile('myfile.py')</code> (from another script, that can be located in another directory and that can have another current directory.</li>
</ul>

<p>I know that there is no perfect solution, because in some cases but I'm looking for the best approach that solved most of the cases.</p>

<p>The most used approach is <code>os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))</code> but this is really doesn't work if you execute the script from another one with <code>exec()</code>.</p>

<h2>Warning</h2>

<p>Any solution that uses current directory will fail, this can be different based on the way the script is called or it can be changed inside the running script.</p>

<p>is indeed the best you're going to get.</p>

<p>It's unusual to be executing a script with <code>exec</code>/<code>execfile</code>; normally you should be using the module infrastructure to load scripts. If you must use these methods, I suggest setting <code>__file__</code> in the <code>globals</code> you pass to the script so it can read that filename.</p>

<p>There's no other way to get the filename in execed code: as you note, the CWD may be in a completely different place.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>If you really want to cover the case that a script is called via <code>execfile(...)</code>, you can use the <code>inspect</code> module to deduce the filename (including the path).  As far as I am aware, this will work for all cases you listed:</p>

<pre><code>filename = inspect.getframeinfo(inspect.currentframe()).filename
path = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(filename))
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Would</p>

<pre><code>import os
cwd = os.getcwd()
</code></pre>

<p>do what you want?  I'm not sure what exactly you mean by the "current script directory".  What would the expected output be for the use cases you gave?</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>imho, just use <code>os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))</code> and examine very carefully whether there is a real need for the case where <code>exec</code> is used.  it could be a sign of troubled design if you are not able to use your script as a module for whatever strange reason.  </p>

<p>keep in mind <em>Zen of Python #8</em>, and if you believe there is a good argument for a use-case where it must work for <code>exec</code>, then please let us know some more details about the background of the problem  :) </p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>First.. a couple missing use-cases here if we're talking about ways to inject anonymous code..</p>

<pre><code>code.compile_command()
code.interact()
imp.load_compiled()
imp.load_dynamic()
imp.load_module()
__builtin__.compile()
loading C compiled shared objects? example: _socket?)
</code></pre>

<p>But, the real question is, what is your goal - are you trying to enforce some sort of security? Or are you just interested in whats being loaded.</p>

<p>If you're interested in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity" rel="nofollow">security</a>, the filename that is being imported via exec/execfile is inconsequential - you should use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/rexec.html" rel="nofollow">rexec</a>, which offers the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This module contains the RExec class,
  which supports r_eval(), r_execfile(),
  r_exec(), and r_import() methods, which 
  are restricted versions of the standard
  Python functions eval(), execfile() and 
  the exec and import statements. Code 
  executed in this restricted environment
  will only have access to modules and 
  functions that are deemed safe; you can 
  subclass RExec add or remove capabilities as
  desired.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, if this is more of an academic pursuit.. here are a couple goofy approaches that you
might be able to dig a little deeper into.. </p>

<p>Example scripts:</p>

<p><strong>./deep.py</strong></p>

<pre><code>print ' &gt;&gt; level 1'
execfile('deeper.py')
print ' &lt;&lt; level 1'
</code></pre>

<p><strong>./deeper.py</strong></p>

<pre><code>print '\t &gt;&gt; level 2'
exec("import sys; sys.path.append('/tmp'); import deepest")
print '\t &lt;&lt; level 2'
</code></pre>

<p><strong>/tmp/deepest.py</strong></p>

<pre><code>print '\t\t &gt;&gt; level 3'
print '\t\t\t I can see the earths core.'
print '\t\t &lt;&lt; level 3'
</code></pre>

<p><strong>./codespy.py</strong></p>

<pre><code>import sys, os

def overseer(frame, event, arg):
    print "loaded(%s)" % os.path.abspath(frame.f_code.co_filename)

sys.settrace(overseer)
execfile("deep.py")
sys.exit(0)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Output</strong></p>

<pre><code>loaded(/Users/synthesizerpatel/deep.py)
&gt;&gt; level 1
loaded(/Users/synthesizerpatel/deeper.py)
    &gt;&gt; level 2
loaded(/Users/synthesizerpatel/&lt;string&gt;)
loaded(/tmp/deepest.py)
        &gt;&gt; level 3
            I can see the earths core.
        &lt;&lt; level 3
    &lt;&lt; level 2
&lt;&lt; level 1
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, this is a resource-intensive way to do it, you'd be tracing
all your code.. Not very efficient. But, I think it's a novel approach
since it continues to work even as you get deeper into the nest.
You can't override 'eval'. Although you <em>can</em> override execfile().</p>

<p>Note, this approach only coveres exec/execfile, not 'import'.
For higher level 'module' load hooking you might be able to use use
<a href="http://blog.doughellmann.com/2009/11/pymotw-sys-part-7-modules-and-imports.html" rel="nofollow">sys.path_hooks</a> (Write-up courtesy of PyMOTW).</p>

<p>Thats all I have off the top of my head. </p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Here is a partial solution, still better than all published ones so far.</p>

<pre><code>import sys, os, os.path, inspect

#os.chdir("..")

if '__file__' not in locals():
    __file__ = inspect.getframeinfo(inspect.currentframe())[0]

print os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
</code></pre>

<p>Now this works will all calls but if someone use <code>chdir()</code> to change the current directory, this will also fail.</p>

<p>Notes: </p>

<ul>
<li><code>sys.argv[0]</code> is not going to work, will return <code>-c</code> if you execute the script with <code>python -c "execfile('path-tester.py')"</code></li>
<li>I published a complete test at <a href="https://gist.github.com/1385555" rel="nofollow">https://gist.github.com/1385555</a> and you are welcome to improve it.</li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I use sys.path[0], but I'm not sure it works with exec</p>
