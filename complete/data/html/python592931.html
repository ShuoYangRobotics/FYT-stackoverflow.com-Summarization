<h3>Question (ID-592931):</h3><h2>Why doesn't Python have static variables?</h2><p>There is a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/460586/simulating-a-local-static-variable-in-python">questions asking how to simulate static variables in python</a>.</p>

<p>Also, on the web one can find many different solutions to create static variables. (Though I haven't seen one that I like yet.)</p>

<p>Why doesn't Python support static variables in methods? Is this considered unpythonic or has it something to do with Python's syntax?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>I asked specifically about the <em>why</em> of the design decision and I haven't provided any code example because I wanted to avoid explanation to simulate static variables.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-9):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The idea behind this omission is that static variables are only useful in two situations: when you really should be using a class and when you really should be using a generator.</p>

<p>If you want to attach stateful information to a function, what you need is a class.  A trivially simple class, perhaps, but a class nonetheless:</p>

<pre><code>def foo(bar):
    static my_bar # doesn't work

    if not my_bar:
        my_bar = bar

    do_stuff(my_bar)

foo(bar)
foo()

# -- becomes -&gt;

class Foo(object):
    def __init__(self, bar):
        self.bar = bar

    def __call__(self):
        do_stuff(self.bar)

foo = Foo(bar)
foo()
foo()
</code></pre>

<p>If you want your function's behavior to change each time it's called, what you need is a generator:</p>

<pre><code>def foo(bar):
    static my_bar # doesn't work

    if not my_bar:
        my_bar = bar

    my_bar = my_bar * 3 % 5

    return my_bar

foo(bar)
foo()

# -- becomes -&gt;

def foogen(bar):
    my_bar = bar

    while True:
        my_bar = my_bar * 3 % 5
        yield my_bar

foo = foogen(bar)
foo.next()
foo.next()
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, static variables <em>are</em> useful for quick-and-dirty scripts where you don't want to deal with the hassle of big structures for little tasks.  But there, you don't really need anything more than <code>global</code> â€” it may seem a but kludgy, but that's okay for small, one-off scripts:</p>

<pre><code>def foo():
    global bar
    do_stuff(bar)

foo()
foo()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>One alternative to a class is a function attribute:</p>

<pre><code>def foo(arg):
    if not hasattr(foo, 'cache'):
        foo.cache = get_data_dict()
    return foo.cache[arg]
</code></pre>

<p>While a class is probably cleaner, this technique can be useful and is nicer, in my opinion, then a global.  </p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I think most uses of local static variables is to simulate generators, that is, having some function which performs some iteration of a process, returns the result, but mantains the state for the subsequent invocation.  Python handles this very elegantly using the <code>yield</code> command, so it seems there is not so much need for static variables.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>It's a design choice.</p>

<p>I'm assuming Guido thinks you don't need them very often, and you never <em>really</em> need them: you can always just use a global variable and tell everyone to keep their greasy paws offa' your variable ;-)</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>For caching or <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/52201/" rel="nofollow">memoization</a> purposes, decorators can be used as an elegant and general solution.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>In Python 3, I would use a closure:</p>

<pre><code>def makefoo():
    x = 0
    def foo():
        nonlocal x
        x += 1
        return x
    return foo

foo = makefoo()

print(foo())
print(foo())
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>The answer's pretty much the same as why nobody uses static methods (even though they exist).  You have a module-level namespace that serves about the same purpose as a class would anyway.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>An ill-advised alternative:</p>

<p>You can also use the side-effects of the definition time evaluation of function defaults:</p>

<pre><code>def func(initial=0, my_static=[])
  if not my_static:
    my_static.append(initial)

   my_static[0] += 1
  return my_static[0]

print func(0), func(0), func(0)
</code></pre>

<p>Its <em>really</em> ugly and easily subverted, but works.  Using <code>global</code> would be cleaner than this, imo.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>From one of your comments: "I'd like to use them to cache things loaded from disk. I think it clutters the instance less, if I could assign them to the function"</p>

<p>Use a caching class then, as a class or instance attribute to your other class. That way, you can use the full feature set of classes without cluttering other things. Also, you get a reusable tool.</p>

<p>This shows that on SO it always pays off to state one's problem instead of asking for a specific, low level solution (e.g. for a missing language feature). That way, instead of endless debates about simulating "static" (a deprecated feature from an ancient language, in my view) someone could have given a good answer to you problem sooner.</p>
