<h3>Question (ID-4655591):</h3><h2>Python Sort List</h2><p>I'm currently python and quite new to this language.</p>

<p>Sort List Based on Two CriteriaGiven a list of words, return a list with the same words in order of length (longest to shortest), the second sort criteria should be alphabetical. Hint: you need think of two functions.</p>

<p>Can anyone help me with this?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You only need one call to <code>sort</code>, because Python automatically sorts tuples lexicographically. That is, if you ask Python to compare two tuples it will order them by their first element, except if those compare equal in which case it will order them by their second element, except if those compare equal in which case...</p>

<p>You want to sort the list of elements by minus their length and then alphabetically, so you want the key of a string <code>s</code> to be the tuple <code>(-len(s), s)</code>. Hence:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; l = ['aa','aaa','aaaa','b','bb','z','ccc']
&gt;&gt;&gt; sort_key = lambda s: (-len(s), s)
&gt;&gt;&gt; l.sort(key=sort_key)
&gt;&gt;&gt; l
['aaaa', 'aaa', 'ccc', 'aa', 'bb', 'b', 'z']
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>In Python, list's sort method has a key which can be used to specify the criteria for sorting.
For the problem you describe I would use the key as well as do the normal sorting as follows.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; l = ['aa','aaa','aaaa','b','bb','z','ccc']
&gt;&gt;&gt; l.sort(key=len,reverse=True)
&gt;&gt;&gt; l
['aaaa', 'ccc', 'aaa', 'bb', 'aa', 'z', 'b']
&gt;&gt;&gt; l.sort()
&gt;&gt;&gt; l
['aa', 'aaa', 'aaaa', 'b', 'bb', 'ccc', 'z']
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><pre>
a = sorted([["foo", "o"], ["bar2", "yadda"], ["allo","as3r"]], key=len)
b = sorted(a)
</pre>

<p>i believe that works...i'm, new to python</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Hints:</p>

<pre><code>mylist = ['one', 'three', 'zero']

mylist.sort(key=len)

print mylist

mylist.reverse()

print mylist

mylist.sort()

print mylist

otherlist = [(2, 'a'), (1, 'a'), (3, 'b'), (3, 'a')]

otherlist.sort()

print otherlist

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Sorry about this. I'm new to this site.</p>

<p>This is not my assignment question. I'm practising python on www.singpath.com and this is one of the question from the site. I had try researching but cant manage to find anything helpful on it.</p>

<p>Thanks for everyone who reply to this question.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><h2>Design</h2>

<p>The keyword here is "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Stability" rel="nofollow">stable sorting algorithm</a>".  Think of two <strong>stable</strong> sorting functions:</p>

<ul>
<li>one sorting according to length (maintaining the relative order of entries with equal lengths),</li>
<li>the other sorting alphabetically.</li>
</ul>

<p>In which order would you combine them in order to get the desired order?</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>As others have mentioned, the first sorting function can be called like this:</p>

<pre><code>list.sort(key=len, reverse=True)
</code></pre>

<p>The second sorting function can be called like this:</p>

<pre><code>list.sort()
</code></pre>

<p>This should be enough to write a complete solution.</p>

<h2>Result</h2>

<p>If you combine the function in the right way, you should get the following:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; l = ['aaa', 'fff', 'bbb', 'ddd', 'e', 'cccc']
# ... sorting functions combined in the right way ...
&gt;&gt;&gt; l
['cccc', 'aaa', 'bbb', 'ddd', 'fff', 'e']
</code></pre>
