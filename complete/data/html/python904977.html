<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You are probably going to want some type of "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud%5Fcomputing" rel="nofollow">Cloud Computing</a>" provider. I would suggest going with <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/" rel="nofollow">Google App Engine</a>, as you get a free account set up pretty easily.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Check <a href="http://www.pythonanywhere.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pythonanywhere.com/</a>. The site is still in beta mode but looks awesome and you have have 512 Mb of space. You can also store files and sync them with dropbox.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Check out utility mill (Sorry i cant provide a link it seems). But They have some nice features like rest api and revision control. The only catch is your script should be open source.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p><a href="http://rextester.com/runcode" rel="nofollow">rextester</a> does that</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Google for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=python%2Bhosting" rel="nofollow">python hosting</a>, or set up a webserver yourself.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I was using public svn server (dejavu).  Now I am going to look for some free git server. </p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Check out <a href="http://codenode.org" rel="nofollow">http://codenode.org</a> which is best described as "Google docs combined with Mathematica Notebooks".  It is an active open source project, licensed under the BSD, and supports Python very well right now.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>Do you mean online python interpreter like <a href="http://pythonfiddle.com/" rel="nofollow">http://pythonfiddle.com/</a></p>
