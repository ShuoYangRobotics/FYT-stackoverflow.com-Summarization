<h3>Question (ID-3559559):</h3><h2>How to delete a character from a string using python?</h2><p>This is for a friend and we are brand new to Python.</p>

<p>There is a string, for example <code>EXAMPLE</code></p>

<p>How can I remove the middle character i.e. <code>M</code> from it. I don't need the code, what I want to know is</p>

<ul>
<li>Do strings in python end in any special character?</li>
<li>Which is a better way - shifting everything right to left starting from the middle character OR creation of a new string and not copying the middle character?</li>
</ul>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>This is probably the best way:</p>

<pre><code>original = "EXAMPLE"
removed = original.replace("M", "")
</code></pre>

<p>Don't worry about shifting characters and such.  Most python takes place on a much higher level of abstraction.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>In Python, strings are immutable, so you have to create a new string.  You have a few options of how to create the new string.  If you want to remove the 'M' wherever it appears:</p>

<pre><code>newstr = oldstr.replace("M", "")
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to remove the central character:</p>

<pre><code>midlen = len(oldstr)/2
newstr = oldstr[:midlen] + oldstr[midlen+1:]
</code></pre>

<p>You asked if strings end with a special character.  No, you are thinking like a C programmer.  In Python, strings are stored with their length, so any byte value, including <code>\0</code>, can appear in a string.</p>

<p>You can't, because strings in Python are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object" rel="nofollow">immutable</a>.</p>

<p>No. They are similar to lists of characters; the length of the list defines the length of the string, and no character acts as a terminator.</p>

<p>You cannot modify the existing string, so you must create a new one containing everything except the middle character.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>To replace a specific position:</p>

<pre><code>s = s[:pos] + s[(pos+1):]
</code></pre>

<p>To replace a specific character:</p>

<pre><code>s = s.replace('M','')
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p><a href="http://docs.python.org/library/userdict.html#UserString.MutableString" rel="nofollow">UserString.MutableString</a></p>

<p>mutable way:</p>

<pre><code>import UserString

s = UserString.MutableString("EXAMPLE")

&gt;&gt;&gt; type(s)
&lt;type 'str'&gt;

#del 'M'
del s[3]

#turn it for immutable:
s = str(s)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Strings are immutable in Python so both your options mean the same thing basically.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Strings are immutable. But you can convert them to a list, which is mutable, and then convert the list back to a string after you've changed it.</p>

<pre><code>s = "this is a string"

l = list(s)  # convert to list

l[1] = ""    # "delete" letter h (the item actually still exists but is empty)
l[1:2] = []  # really delete letter h (the item is actually removed from the list)
del(l[1])    # another way to delete it

p = l.index("a")  # find position of the letter "a"
del(l[p])         # delete it

s = "".join(l)  # convert back to string
</code></pre>

<p>You can also create a new string, as others have shown, by taking everything <em>except</em> the character you want from the existing string.</p>
