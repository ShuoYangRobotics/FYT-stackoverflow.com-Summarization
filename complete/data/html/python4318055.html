<h3>Question (ID-4318055):</h3><h2>python sort strings with digits at the end</h2><p>what is the easiest way to sort a list of strings with digits at the end where some have 3 digits and some have 4:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; list = ['asdf123', 'asdf1234', 'asdf111', 'asdf124']
&gt;&gt;&gt; list.sort()
&gt;&gt;&gt; print list
['asdf111', 'asdf123', 'asdf1234', 'asdf124']
</code></pre>

<p>should  put the 1234 one on the end. is there an easy way to do this?</p>

<p>No</p>

<p>It's perfectly unclear what the real rules are.  The "some have 3 digits and some have 4" isn't really a very precise or complete specification.  All your examples show 4 letters in front of the digits.  Is this always true?</p>

<pre><code>import re
key_pat = re.compile( r"^(\D+)(\d+)$" )
def key( item ):
    m= key_pat.match( item )
    return m.group(1), int(m.group(2))
</code></pre>

<p>That <code>key</code> function might do what you want.  Or it might be too complex.  Or maybe the pattern is really <code>r"^(.*)(\d{3,4})$"</code> or maybe the rules are even more obscure.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; data= ['asdf123', 'asdf1234', 'asdf111', 'asdf124']
&gt;&gt;&gt; data.sort( key=key )
&gt;&gt;&gt; data
['asdf111', 'asdf123', 'asdf124', 'asdf1234']
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The issue is that the sorting is <strong>alphabetical here since they are strings</strong>. Each sequence of character is compared before moving to next character.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 'a1234' &lt; 'a124'  &lt;----- positionally '3' is less than '4' 
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>You will need to due <strong>numeric sorting</strong> to get the desired output.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = ['asdf123', 'asdf1234', 'asdf111', 'asdf124']
&gt;&gt;&gt; y = [ int(t[4:]) for t in x]
&gt;&gt;&gt; z = sorted(y)
&gt;&gt;&gt; z
[111, 123, 124, 1234]
&gt;&gt;&gt; l = ['asdf'+str(t) for t in z]
&gt;&gt;&gt; l
['asdf111', 'asdf123', 'asdf124', 'asdf1234']
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><pre><code>l = ['asdf123', 'asdf1234', 'asdf111', 'asdf124']
l.sort(cmp=lambda x,y:cmp(int(x[4:]), int(y[4:]))
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You need a key function. You're willing to specify 3 or 4 digits at the end and I have a feeling that you want them to compare numerically. </p>

<pre><code>sorted(list_, key=lambda s: (s[:-4], int(s[-4:])) if s[-4] in '0123456789' else (s[:-3], int(s[-3:]))) 
</code></pre>

<p>Without the lambda and conditional expression that's</p>

<pre><code>def key(s):
    if key[-4] in '0123456789':
         return (s[:-4], int(s[-4:]))
    else:
         return (s[:-3], int(s[-3:]))

sorted(list_, key=key)
</code></pre>

<p>This just takes advantage of the fact that tuples sort by the first element, then the second. So because the <code>key</code> function is called to get a value to compare, the elements will now be compared like the tuples returned by the key function. For example, <code>'asdfbad123'</code> will compare to  <code>'asd7890'</code> as <code>('asdfbad', 123)</code> compares to <code>('asd', 7890)</code>. If the last 3 characters of a string aren't in fact digits, you'll get a ValueError which is perfectly appropriate given the fact that you passed it data that doesn't fit the specs it was designed for.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><pre><code>L.sort(key=lambda s:int(''.join(filter(str.isdigit,s[-4:]))))

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>What you're probably describing is called a <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/12/sorting-for-humans-natural-sort-order.html" rel="nofollow">Natural Sort</a>, or a Human Sort. If you're using Python, you can borrow from <a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/200712.html#e20071211T054956" rel="nofollow">Ned's implementation</a>.</p>

<p>The algorithm for a natural sort is approximately as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Split each value into alphabetical "chunks" and numerical "chunks"</li>
<li>Sort by the first chunk of each value
<ul>
<li>If the chunk is alphabetical, sort it as usual</li>
<li>If the chunk is numerical, sort by the numerical value represented</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Take the values that have the same first chunk and sort them by the second chunk</li>
<li>And so on</li>
</ul>
