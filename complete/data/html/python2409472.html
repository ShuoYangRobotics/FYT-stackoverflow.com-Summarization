<h3>Question (ID-2409472):</h3><h2>Python: How expensive is to create a small list many times?</h2><p>I encounter the following small annoying dilemma over and over again in Python:</p>

<p>Option 1:</p>

<p>cleaner but slower(?) if called many times since a_list get re-created for each call of do_something()</p>

<pre><code>def do_something():    
  a_list = ["any", "think", "whatever"]    
  # read something from a_list
</code></pre>

<p>Option 2:</p>

<p>Uglier but more efficient (spare the a_list creation all over again)</p>

<pre><code>a_list = ["any", "think", "whatever"]    
def do_something():    
  # read something from a_list
</code></pre>

<p>What do you think?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>What's ugly about it?</p>

<p>Are the contents of the list always constants, as in your example? If so: recent versions of Python (since 2.4) will optimise that by evaluating the constant expression and keeping the result but only if it's a tuple. So you could change it to being a tuple. Or you could stop worrying about small things like that.</p>

<p>Here's a list of constants and a tuple of constants:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def afunc():
...    a = ['foo', 'bar', 'zot']
...    b = ('oof', 'rab', 'toz')
...    return
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; import dis; dis.dis(afunc)
  2           0 LOAD_CONST               1 ('foo')
              3 LOAD_CONST               2 ('bar')
              6 LOAD_CONST               3 ('zot')
              9 BUILD_LIST               3
             12 STORE_FAST               0 (a)

  3          15 LOAD_CONST               7 (('oof', 'rab', 'toz'))
             18 STORE_FAST               1 (b)

  4          21 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)
             24 RETURN_VALUE
&gt;&gt;&gt;

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Never create something more than once if you don't have to.  This is a simply optimization that can be done on your part and I personally do not find the second example ugly at all.</p>

<p>Some may argue not to worry about optimizing little things like this but I feel that something this simple to fix should be done immediately.  I would hate to see your application create multiple copies of anything that it doesn't need to simply to preserve an arbitrary sense of "code beauty". :)</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Option 3: </p>

<pre><code>def do_something(a_list = ("any", "think", "whatever")):
    read something from a_list
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Option 3 compared to Option 1:</strong></p>

<p>Both are equally readable in my opinion (though some seem to think differently in the comments! :-) ). You could even write Option 3 like this</p>

<pre><code>def do_something(
    a_list = ("any", "think", "whatever")):
    read something from a_list
</code></pre>

<p>which really minimizes the difference in terms of readability. 
Unlike Option 1, however, Option 3 defines <code>a_list</code> only once -- at the time when <code>do_something</code> is defined. That's exactly what we want.</p>

<p><strong>Option 3 compared to Option 2:</strong></p>

<p>Avoid global variables if possible. Option 3 allows you to do that.
Also, with Option 2, over time or if other people maintain this code, the definition of <code>a_list</code> could get separated from <code>def do_something</code>. This may not be a big deal, but I think it is somewhat undesireable.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>if your <code>a_list</code> doesn't change, move it out of the function.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><ol>
<li>You have some data</li>
<li>You have a method associated with it</li>
<li>You don't want to keep the data globally just for the sake of optimising the speed of the method unless you have to.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think this is what classes are for.</p>

<pre><code>class Processor:
    def __init__(this):
        this.data = "any thing whatever".split()
    def fun(this,arg):
        # do stuff with arg and list

inst = Processor()
inst.fun("skippy)
</code></pre>

<p>Also, if you someday want to separate out the data into a file, you can just modify the constructor to do so.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Well it seems it comes down to initializing the array in the function or not:</p>

<pre><code>import time
def fun1():
        a = ['any', 'think', 'whatever']
        sum = 0
        for i in range(100):
                sum += i

def fun2():
        sum = 0
        for i in range(100):
                sum += i


def test_fun(fun, times):
        start = time.time()
        for i in range(times):
                fun()
        end=time.time()
        print "Function took %s" % (end-start)

# Test
print 'warming up'
test_fun(fun1, 100)
test_fun(fun2, 100)

print 'Testing fun1'
test_fun(fun1, 100000)
print 'Testing fun2'
test_fun(fun2, 100000)

print 'Again'
print 'Testing fun1'
test_fun(fun1, 100000)
print 'Testing fun2'
test_fun(fun2, 100000)
</code></pre>

<p>and the results:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;python test.py
warming up
Function took 0.000604152679443
Function took 0.000600814819336

</code></pre>

<p>Looks like there is no difference.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>If the list is never modified, why do you use lists at all?</p>

<p>Without knowing your actual requirements, I'd recommend to simply use some if-statements to get rid of the list and the "read something from list" part completely.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>I've worked on automated systems that process 100,000,000+ records a day, where a 1% percent performance improvement is huge. </p>

<p>I learned a big lesson working on that system:  Faster is better, but only when you know when it's fast enough.</p>

<p>A 1% improvement would have been a huge reduction in total processing time, but it isn't enough to effect when we would need our next hardware upgrade.  My application was so fast, that the amount of time I spent trying to milk that last 1% probably cost more than a new server would have.</p>

<p>In your case, you would have to call do_something tens of thousands of times before making a significant difference in performance.  In some cases that would make a difference, in other it won't.</p>
