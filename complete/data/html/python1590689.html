<h3>Question (ID-1590689):</h3><h2>What is the best advanced Python book?</h2><p>Can someone suggest an advanced Python book? I want a book  that covers topics such as threading, networking, memory management and so on.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I find "Python Essential Reference" useful. It is a great reference and general language book.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>For the topics you described, you need to understand operating systems more than python.  Once the OS level becomes clear, the Python code is quite obvious. </p>

<p>This is one of the best books ever written:</p>

<p><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0321525949" rel="nofollow"><strong>Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment, Second Edition (Addison-Wesley Professional Computing Series) (Paperback)</strong></a></p>

<p>ISBN-10: 0321525949<br />
ISBN-13: 978-0321525949</p>

<p>5 star amazon reviews (I'd give it 6).</p>

<p>Once I realized that networking, file I/O, shared memory, IPC, sockets, signals, etc... are all provided by the OS layer, then this became the answer to a lot of questions.  </p>

<p>Then going back to python, you understand what all the stuff in the <strong>os</strong> module means, and can write really advanced programs with ease.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>The python cookbook is a good repository of examples, though some of them are getting a bit long in the tooth these days. The second edition is newer (2005), though it is targeted to 2.4.</p>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/184719494X" rel="nofollow">Expert Python Programming</a>.  it covers not just the general best practices (generators, iterators, etc) but then the real stuff you need to build a project -- documentation w/ restructured text &amp; sphinx, testing with nose, buildout, setuptools, etc.</p>
