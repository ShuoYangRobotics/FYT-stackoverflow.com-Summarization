<h3>Question (ID-591253):</h3><h2>When using random, which form returns an equal 50% chance?</h2><p>I'm guessing that most built in random generators return something like this:</p>

<pre><code>[0.0, 1.0)
</code></pre>

<p>so if I would like a 50% chance would I use something like this:</p>

<pre><code>if random() &lt; .5
</code></pre>

<p>or something like:</p>

<pre><code>if random() &lt;= .5
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks for the help.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-11):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Ah, the old ".5" problem. Here's the answer:</p>

<p>If you're going to divide 10 things into two <strong>equal</strong> parts, you need 5 things in each part. 0 thru 4 in the first part, 5-9 in the second part. So... <code>&lt; .5</code> is correct.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>To a first approximation, either works.</p>

<p>The best way is to choose a random generator that specifically emits booleans or integers with range.  Then you can nail the range exactly.</p>

<p>Operations like "equality" with floating point is iffy anyway.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><pre><code> if random() &lt; .5
</code></pre>

<p>In binary, .5 is .10000000000....
So, basically, the question reduces to, "What is the first binary digit after the radix point... 0 (for &lt;.5) or 1 (for .5 or more) ?"</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Why do it yourself? Python has random.choice :)</p>

<p>random.choice([0, 1]) will give you 0/1 with equal chances -- and it is a standard part of Python, coded up by the same people who wrote random.random (and thus know more about its semantics than anyone else)</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>For a particular system you should test it, if you really want to find out.  Could take a while though :-)</p>

<p>I agree with the other posters that to the first order, it doesn't matter.  If it does matter, you'll need a better RNG anyway.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>  I just tried the default RNG in C# with 1,000,000,000 attempts and the answers were identical...</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><pre><code>import random
def fifty_fifty():
    "Return 0 or 1 with 50% chance for each"
    return random.randrange(2)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><pre><code>&lt; .5
</code></pre>

<p>but that assumes that your floating point support is good enough to satisfy your precision demands (since it's never <em>exactly</em>).</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>If I want 50% chance, I'd just check for the LSB (Least Significant Bit).</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>If you need truly random numbers, you can try <a href="http://random.org/" rel="nofollow">random.org</a>. They offer a web service connected to a device that detects noise coming from the universe. Still not random technically speaking, but close enough I guess. </p>

<p>They have all sort of way to make the query such as black and white images.</p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>If you're going to be that fussy about your random numbers, don't rely on anything that comes built-in.  Get a well-documented RNG from a place you trust (I trust Boost, for what that's worth), and read the documentation.  It used to be that standard RNGs were notoriously bad, and I still wouldn't trust them.</p>

<p>Alternately, use an integer RNG that gives you discrete values within a range, and divide the range in half.  RNGs, in my experience, are integral, and the floating-point function simply divides by the top of the range.</p>

<p>Of course, if this is true, you've got your answer.  If the integer RNG produces 0, 1, 2, and 3, the floating-point equivalent will be 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75, so the answer is to test &lt; 0.5.</p>

<p>If the RNG isn't based on integral calculations, then it's based on floating-point calculations, and hence is inexact.  In that case, it doesn't matter whether you test &lt;= or &lt;, since there is no guarantee that a calculation that should be a precise 0.5 will be.</p>

<p>So, the answer is probably to test &lt; 0.5, which will likely be the correct one if it makes a difference.</p>
<br /><b>#10</b><br /><p>It doesn't matter.  Both formulas yield the desired result.</p>
