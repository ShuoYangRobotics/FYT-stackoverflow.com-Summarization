<h3>Question (ID-6436170):</h3><h2>Extracting line after new line</h2><p>I have a text file with something like</p>

<pre><code>Country1
city1
city2

Country2
city3
city4
</code></pre>

<p>I want to separate country and cities. Is there any quick way of doing it? I am thinking of some file handling and then extracting to different files, is it best way or can be done with some regex etc quickly?</p>

<p>output:</p>

<pre><code>['Country1', 'Country2']
['city1', 'city2', 'city3', 'city4']

<p>if you want to write these to files:</p>

<pre><code>with open("countries.txt","w") as country_file, open("cities.txt","w") as city_file:
    country_file.write("\n".join(countries))
    city_file.write("\n".join(cities))

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Depending on how regular your file is, it may be this simple in python:</p>

<pre><code>with open('inputfile.txt') as fh:
  # To iterate over the entire file.
  for country in fh:
    cityLines = [next(fh) for _i in range(2)]

    # read a blank line to advance countries.
    next(fh)
</code></pre>

<p>That's not likely to be exactly right, because I imagine many countries have variable numbers of cities.  You could modify it like so to address that:</p>

<pre><code>with open('inputfile.txt') as fh:
  # To iterate over the entire file.
  for country in fh:
    # we assume here that each country has at least 1 city.
      cities = [next(fh).strip()]

      while cities[-1]: # will continue until we encounter a blank line.
        cities.append(next(fh).strip())
</code></pre>

<p>That doesn't do anything to put the data into an output file, or store it much past the file handle itself, but it's a start.  You really should choose a language for your questions though.  A lot of the time until </p>

$cities = array();
$gap = false;

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Not sure that this would help, but you can try to use the following code to get dictionary and then work with it(write to files, compare and etc):</p>

<pre><code>res = {}
with open('c:\\tst.txt') as f:
    lines = f.readlines()
    for i,line in enumerate(lines):
        line = line.strip()
        if (i == 0 and line):
            key = line
            res[key] = []
        elif not line and i+1 &lt; len(lines):
            key = lines[i+1].strip()
            res[key] = []
        elif line and line != key:
            res[key].append(line)
print res
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Another PHP example that doesn't read the entire file in an array.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

$fh = fopen('countries.txt', 'r');

$countries = array();
$cities = array();

while ( $data = fgets($fh) )
{
  // If $country is empty (or not defined), the this line is a country.
  if ( ! isset($country) )
  {
    $country = trim($data);
    $countries[] = $country;
  }
  // If an empty line is found, unset $country.
  elseif ( ! trim($data) )
    unset($country);
  // City
  else
    $cities[$country][] = trim($data);
}

fclose($fh);
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>$countries</code> array will contain a list of countries while the <code>$cities</code> array will contain a list of cities by countries.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Is there some pattern that distinguishes countries from cities?  Or is it that the first line after a blank line is a country and all subsequent lines are city names until the next blank line?  Alternatively are you finding countries based on a look-up table (a "dictionary" in Python; an associative array in PHP; a hash in Perl --- one that includes all the officially recognized countries)?</p>

<p>Is it safe to assume that there are no cities whose names collide with any country?  Is there a France, Iowa, USA, or the old Usa, Japan?</p>

<p>What do you want to do with these after you separate them?  You mention "some file handling and then extracting to different files" --- are you thinking of something like one file per country containing a list of all the cities therein?  Or one directory per country and one file per city?</p>

<p>The obvious approach would be to iterate over the file, line by line, and maintain a little state machine:  empty (beginning of file, blank lines between countries?) during which you enter the "country" state (whenever you found any pattern that matches whatever criteria means you've encountered the name of a country).  Once you've found a country name then you're in the city loading state.  I would create a dictionary using country names as keys and set of cities as cities (though perhaps you might really need county/provice, city name tuples in cases where a country has multiple cities by the same name: Portland, Maine vs. Portland, Oregon, for example).  You can also have some "error" state if the contents of your file lead to some sort of ambiguity (city names before you've determined a country, two country names in a row, whatever).</p>

<p>It's hard to suggest a good fragment of code given how vague your spec. here is.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>PHP example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
error_reporting(E_ALL);
define("SEPARATOR", "\r\n"); // windows text file, change if necessary
$input_content = file_get_contents("input.txt");
$output_country = array();
$output_city = array();
$data_groups = explode(SEPARATOR . SEPARATOR, $input_content);
foreach($data_groups as $data_group) {
    $data_rows = explode(SEPARATOR, $data_group);
    $output_country[] = array_shift($data_rows);
    foreach($data_rows as $data_row) {
        $output_city[] = $data_row;
    }
}
var_dump($output_country);
var_dump($output_city);
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>This regex would work for your example:</p>

<pre><code>/(?:^|\r\r)(.+?)\r(.+?)(?=\r\r|$)/s
</code></pre>

<p>Catches countries in group 1 and cities in group 2.
You may have to adjust your newline characters, depending on your system. They can be \n, \r or \r\n. edit: added a $ sign, so you don't need two linebreaks at the end. You will need the flag for dotall for the regex to work as expected.</p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>Print fild 1 with awk - countries</p>

<pre><code>awk 'BEGIN {RS="";FS="\n"} {print $1 &gt; "countries"} {for (i=2;i&lt;=NF;i++) print $i &gt; "cities"}' source.txt 
</code></pre>
