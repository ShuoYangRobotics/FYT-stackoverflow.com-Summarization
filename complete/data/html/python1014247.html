<h3>Question (ID-1014247):</h3><h2>What Can A 'TreeDict' (Or Treemap) Be Used For In Practice?</h2><p>I'm developing a 'TreeDict' class in Python.  This is a basically a dict that allows you to retrieve its key-value pairs in sorted order, just like the Treemap collection class in Java.</p>

<p>I've implemented some functionality based on the way unique indexes in relational databases can be used, e.g. functions to let you retrieve values corresponding to a range of keys, keys greater than, less than or equal to a particular value in sorted order, strings or tuples that have a specific prefix in sorted order, etc.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I can't think of any real life problem that will require a class like this.  I suspect that the reason we don't have sorted dicts in Python is that in practice they aren't required often enough to be worth it, but I want to be proved wrong.  </p>

<p>Can you think of any specific applications of a 'TreeDict'?  Any real life problem that would be best solved by this data structure?  I just want to know for sure whether this is worth it.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I've seen several answers pointing to the "walk in ordered sequence" feature, which is indeed important, but none highlighting the other big feature, which is "find first entry with a key >= this". This has many uses even when there's no real need to "walk" from there.</p>

<p>For example (this came up in a recent SO answer), say you want to generate pseudo-random values with given relative frequencies -- i.e, you're given, say, a dict <code>d</code>:</p>

<pre><code>{'wolf': 42, 'sheep': 15, 'dog': 23, 'goat': 15, 'cat': 5}
</code></pre>

<p>and need a way to generate 'wolf' with a probability of 42 out of 100 (since 100 is the total of the relative frequencies given), 'sheep' 15 out of 100, and so on; and the number of distinct values can be quite large, as can the relative frequencies.</p>

<p>Then, store the given values (in whatever order) as the values in a tree map, with the corresponding keys being the "total cumulative frequency" up to that point. I.e.:</p>

<pre><code>def preprocess(d):
    tot = 0
    for v in d:
        tot += d[v]
        treemap.insert(key=tot, value=v)
    return tot, treemap
</code></pre>

<p>Now, generating a value can be pretty fast (<code>O(log(len(d)))</code>), as follows:</p>

<pre><code>def generate(tot, treemap, r=random):
    n = r.randrange(tot)
    return treemap.firstGTkey(n).value
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>firstGTKey</code> is a method that returns the first entry (with <code>.key</code> and <code>.value</code> attributes, in this hypothetical example) with a key > the given argument. I've used this approach with large files stored as B-Trees, for example (using e.g. <code>bsddb.bt_open</code> and the <code>set_location</code> method).</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The reason for keeping the elements in sorted order is for faster retrieval.  Say I wanted all of the values in the dictionary in a sorted range.  This is much faster with a TreeDict then with the regular hashmap.  It basically allows you to keep everything in the dictionary in sorted order.  I know in the application I'm currently working on uses a class like this to basically query the data structure.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I often use <code>Dict&lt;DateTime, someClassOrValue&gt;</code> when working with industrial process data--
Valve open/close, machinery start/stop, etc.</p>

<p>Having the keys sorted is especially useful when I need to compare time intervals between start/stop or open/close events in a decent amount of time.</p>

<p>However, since I've been able to use linq in C# I've found that it's often easier to just work with IEnumerables and use the IQueryable extension methods to get the information I need.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Almost all "GROUP BY" reporting requires a sorted dictionary.</p>

<pre><code>summary = sortedDefaultDict()
for row in somePileOfData:
    summary[row.group_by] += row.balance
for k in sorted(summary.keys()):
    print k, summary[k]
</code></pre>

<p>This is done so often in data warehousing applications, that it's difficult to express how central this is.</p>

<p>If the <code>sorted</code> function call does no work, it saves a ton of time in the long run.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>It's useful when you need to go through a Dictionary in order of the keys; which comes up on occasion. I've actually found its infinitely more common in certain programming contests then anything else (think ACM, etc).</p>

<p>The most useful feature of a TreeMap is when you want to quickly find the min or max key; using a sorted dictionary this is often a single method call; and algorithmically can be done in O(log(n)) time, as opposed to iterating over each key looking for a min/max if the collection is unsorted. Basically, a much friendlier interface.</p>

<p>One of the more common times I run into it is when objects are identified by a specific name, and you want to print out the objects ordered according to the name; say a mapping from directory name to number of files in a directory.</p>

<p>One other place I've used it is in an excel spreadsheet wrapper; mapping from row number to row object. This lets you quickly find the last row index, without looping through each row.</p>

<p>Also, it's useful when you can easily define a comparison relation on keys, but not necessarily a hashing function, as needed for HashMaps. The best (though weak) example I can think of is case insensitive string keys.</p>
