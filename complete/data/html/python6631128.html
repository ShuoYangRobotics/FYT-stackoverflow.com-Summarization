<h3>Question (ID-6631128):</h3><h2>Assignment in While Loop in Python?</h2><p>I just came across this piece of code</p>

<pre><code>while 1:
    line = data.readline()
    if not line:
        break
    #...
</code></pre>

<p>and thought, there <em>must</em> be a better way to do this, than using an infinite loop with <code>break</code>.</p>

<p>So I tried:</p>

<pre><code>while line = data.readline():
    #...
</code></pre>

<p>and, obviously, got an error.</p>

<p>Is there any way to avoid using a <code>break</code> in that situation?</p>

<h3>Edit:</h3>

<p>Ideally, you'd want to avoid saying <code>readline</code> twice... IMHO, repeating is even worse than just a <code>break</code>, especially if the statement is complex.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Like,</p>

<pre><code>for line in data:
    # ...
</code></pre>

<p>? It large depends on the semantics of the <code>data</code> object's readline semantics. If <code>data</code> is a <code>file</code> object, that'll work.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>If you aren't doing anything fancier with data, like reading more lines later on, there's always:</p>

<pre><code>for line in data:
    ... do stuff ...
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>This isn't much better, but this is the way I usually do it.  Python doesn't return the value upon variable assignment like other languages (e.g., Java).</p>

<pre><code>line = data.readline()
while line:
    ... do stuff ... 
    line = data.readline()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><pre><code>for line in data:
    ... process line somehow....
</code></pre>

<p>Will iterate over each line in the <code>file</code>, rather than using a <code>while</code>. It is a much more common idiom for the task of reading a file in my experience (in Python).</p>

<p>In fact, <code>data</code> does not have to be a file but merely provide an iterator.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>If <code>data</code> has a function that returns an iterator instead of <code>readline</code> (say <code>data.iterate</code>), you could simply do:</p>

<pre><code>for line in data.iterate():
    #...
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>If <code>data</code> is a file, as stated in other answers, using <code>for line in file</code> will work fine. If data is not a file, and a random data reading object, then you should implement it as an iterator, implementing <code>__iter__</code> and <code>next</code> methods. </p>

<p>The <code>next</code> method should to the reading, check if there is more data, and if not, raise <code>StopIteration</code>. If you do this, you can continue using the <code>for line in data</code> idiom.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>You could do:</p>

<pre><code>line = 1
while line:
    line = data.readline()
</code></pre>
