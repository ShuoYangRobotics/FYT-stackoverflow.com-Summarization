<h3>Question (ID-3391998):</h3><h2>Pydoc is not working (Windows XP)</h2><p>Using Windows XP and Python 2.7 I tried to run "pydoc" through the terminal. unfortunately it doesn't work.</p>

<p>Since I'm not allowed to post a screenshot (Newbie). Here is what it says (white on black)</p>

<p>What I type:</p>

<pre><code>"C:\Python27&gt;pydoc raw_input  /"pydoc raw_input"
</code></pre>

<p>My result (It's German an it roughly translates to"The command "pydoc" is either spelled wrong or couldn't be found.):</p>

<pre><code>Der Befehl "pydoc" ist entweder falsch geschrieben oder konnte nicht gefunden werden. 
</code></pre>

<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>By the way, I just started to teach myself programming using Zed Shaws "Learn Python the Hard Way" and this is the first issue I really can't figure out using Google. I start to believe that it is Windows an not me... (being too broke to afford a Mac and to scared to learn Linux).</p>

<pre><code>% python -m pydoc &lt;params here&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>worked. python will look for <code>pydoc.py</code> in the right directories without further ado.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><code>pydoc</code> is actually a Python script (so, on Windows, you need to look for <code>pydoc.py</code>), and it's not added to the Windows %PATH% by default (so you need to give a full pathname).</p>

<p>Try running <code>c:\Python27\Lib\pydoc.py</code> from your command line.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> For a graphical interface to Python's documentation, you might want to instead run <code>c:\Python27\Tools\Scripts\pydocgui.pyw</code> (from the command line or from Windows Explorer).  This starts pydoc's web server on your local PC so you can access the documentation through your web browser.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>There's no <code>pydoc</code> command in Windows.  You'll need to specify the full path to <code>pydoc.py</code>.  For example to start the <code>pydoc</code> GUI use:</p>

<pre><code>python c:\Python26\lib\pydoc.py -g
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to add the <code>pydoc</code> command, create a <code>pydoc.bat</code> file with the following line in it:</p>

<pre><code>@python c:\Python26\lib\pydoc.py %*
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The simplest way to do this would be to change to the Python27/Lib directory and run the command from there, like so:</p>

<pre>
C:\Documents and Settings\username>cd C:\Python27\Lib

C:\Python27\Lib>python pydoc.py raw_input
Help on built-in function raw_input in module __builtin__:
</pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><ol>
<li><p>Check if path you've added to PATH is in there. Type in command line PATH.
If path you've added isn't there then Restart Windows. If it is go next line.</p></li>
<li><p>Type pydoc.py instead of pydoc</p></li>
<li><p>If you don't want type pydoc module extension every time, just add .PY extension 
to PATHEXT variable located at the same place as PATH variable does 
(Computer → Properties → Advanced system settings → Advanced → Environment Variables...
 → System Variables → PATHEXT). Restart your Windows after adding of extension.</p></li>
</ol>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>you can also type <code>help()</code> when you are in the Python terminal which gets you to the same page...</p>
