<h3>Question (ID-269676):</h3><h2>How can I Cause a Deadlock in MySQL for Testing Purposes</h2><p>I want to make my Python library working with MySQLdb be able to detect deadlocks and try again.  I believe I've coded a good solution, and now I want to test it.</p>

<p>Any ideas for the simplest queries I could run using MySQLdb to create a deadlock condition would be?</p>

<p>system info:</p>

<ul>
<li>MySQL 5.0.19 </li>
<li>Client 5.1.11 </li>
<li>Windows XP</li>
<li>Python 2.4 / MySQLdb 1.2.1 p2</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>child.py</strong></p>

<pre><code>import yourDBconnection as dbapi2

def child1():
    print "Child 1 start"
    conn= dbapi2.connect( ... )
    c1= conn.cursor()
    conn.begin() # turn off autocommit, start a transaction

    rb= c1.execute( "UPDATE B SET BC1='Bchgd' WHERE BC1='BC1-1'" )
    print rb
    c1.close()
    print "Child 1 finished"

def child2():
    print "Child 2 start"
    conn= dbapi2.connect( ... )
    c1= conn.cursor()

try:

</code></pre>

<p>Note the symmetry.  Each child starts out holding one resource.  Then they attempt to get someone else's held resource.  You can, for fun, have 3 children and 3 resources for a really vicious circle.</p>

<p>Note that difficulty in contriving a situation in which deadlock occurs.  If your transactions are short -- and consistent -- deadlock is very difficult to achieve.  Deadlock requires (a) transaction which hold locks for a long time AND (b) transactions which acquire locks in an inconsistent order.   I have found it easiest to prevent deadlocks by keeping my transactions short and consistent.</p>

<p>Also note the non-determinism.  You can't predict which child will die with a deadlock and which will continue after the other died.  Only one of the two need to die to release needed resources for the other.  Some RDBMS's claim that there's a rule based on number of resources held blah blah blah, but in general, you'll never know how the victim was chosen.</p>

<p>Because of the two writes being in a specific order, you sort of expect child 1 to die first.  However, you can't guarantee that.  It's not deadlock until child 2 tries to get child 1's resources -- the sequence of who acquired first may not determine who dies.</p>

<p>Also note that these are processes, not threads.  Threads -- because of the Python GIL -- might be inadvertently synchronized and would require lots of calls to <code>time.sleep( 0.001 )</code> to give the other thread a chance to catch up.  Processes -- for this -- are slightly simpler because they're fully independent.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I'm not familar with Python, so excuse my incorrect language If I'm saying this wrong... but open two sessions (in separate windows, or from separate Python processes - from separate boxes would work ... )  Then ... </p>

<p>. In Session A:</p>

<pre><code>   Begin Transaction 
      Insert TableA()  Values()...
</code></pre>

<p>. Then In Session B:</p>

<pre><code>Begin Transaction
  Insert TableB() Values()... 
  Insert TableA() Values() ...
</code></pre>

<p>. Then go back to session A</p>

<pre><code>  Insert TableB() Values () ...
</code></pre>

<p>You'll get a deadlock... </p>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>you can always run LOCK TABLE tablename from another session (mysql CLI for instance). That might do the trick.</p>

<p>It will remain locked until you release it or disconnect the session.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>@s.lott</p>

<p>Looks promising but here's what I get when I run it:</p>

<pre><code> 1: 'Child 1 start\r\n0\r\nChild1 to 1: hit it!\r\n0\r\nChild 1 finished\r\n'
*1: None
 2: 'Child 1 start\r\n0\r\nChild1 to 2: ready, set, go!\r\n0\r\nChild 1 finished
\r\n'
*2: None
 1: ''
*1: None
 2: ''
*2: None
</code></pre>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Here's some pseudocode for how i do it in PHP:</p>

<p>Script 1:</p>

<pre><code>START TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO table &lt;anything you want&gt;;
SLEEP(5);
UPDATE table SET field = 'foo';
COMMIT;
</code></pre>

<p>Script 2:</p>

<pre><code>START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE table SET field = 'foo';
SLEEP(5);
INSERT INTO table &lt;anything you want&gt;;
COMMIT;
</code></pre>

<p>Execute script 1 and then immediately execute script 2 in another terminal. You'll get a deadlock if the database table already has some data in it (In other words, it starts deadlocking after the second time you try this).</p>

<p>Note that if mysql won't honor the SLEEP() command, use Python's equivalent in the application itself.</p>
