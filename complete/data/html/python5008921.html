<h3>Question (ID-5008921):</h3><h2>How do I reverse an itertools.chain object?</h2><p>My function creates a chain of generators:</p>

<pre><code>def bar(num):
    import itertools
    some_sequence = (x*1.5 for x in range(num))
    some_other_sequence = (x*2.6 for x in range(num))
    chained = itertools.chain(some_sequence, some_other_sequence)
    return chained
</code></pre>

<p>My function sometimes needs to return <code>chained</code> in reversed order. Conceptually, the following is what I would like to be able to do:</p>

<pre><code>if num &lt; 0:
    return reversed(chained)
return chained
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; reversed(chained)
TypeError: argument to reversed() must be a sequence
</code></pre>

<p>What are my options?</p>

<p>This is in some realtime graphic rendering code so I don't want to make it too complicated/slow.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:
When I first posed this question I hadn't thought about the reversibility of generators. As many have pointed out, generators can't be reversed.</p>

<p>I do in fact want to reverse the flattened contents of the chain; not just the order of the generators.</p>

<p>Based on the responses, there is no single call I can use to reverse an itertools.chain, so I think the only solution here is to use a list, at least for the reverse case, and perhaps for both.</p>

<p><code>reversed()</code> needs an actual sequence, because it iterates it backwards by index, and that wouldn't work for a generator (which only has the notion of "next" item).</p>

<p>Since you will need to unroll the whole generator anyway for reversing, the most efficient way is to read it to a list and reverse the list in-place with the <code>.reverse()</code> method.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You cannot reverse generators by definition. The interface of a generator is the iterator, which is a container that supports only forward iteration. When you want to reverse a iterator, you have to collect all it's items first and reverse them after that.</p>

<p>Use lists instead or generate the sequences backwards from the start.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>itertools.chain would need to implement <code>__reversed__()</code> (this would be best) or <code>__len__()</code> and <code>__getitem__()</code></p>

<p>Since it doesn't, and there's not even a way to access the internal sequences you'll need to expand the entire sequence to be able to reverse it.</p>

<pre><code>reversed(list(CHAIN_INSTANCE))
</code></pre>

<p>It would be nice if chain would make <code>__reversed__()</code> available when all the sequences are reversable, but currently it does not do that. Perhaps you can write your own version of chain that does</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p><code>reversed</code> only works on objects that support <code>len</code> and indexing. You have to first generate all results of a generator before wrapping <code>reversed</code> around them.</p>

<p>However, you could easily do this:</p>

<pre><code>def bar(num):
    import itertools
    some_sequence = (x*1.5 for x in range(num, -1, -1))
    some_other_sequence = (x*2.6 for x in range(num, -1, -1))
    chained = itertools.chain(some_other_sequence, some_sequence)
    return chained
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Does this work in you real app?</p>

<pre><code>def bar(num):
    import itertools
    some_sequence = (x*1.5 for x in range(num))
    some_other_sequence = (x*2.6 for x in range(num))
    list_of_chains = [some_sequence, some_other_sequence]
    if num &lt; 0:
        list_of_chains.reverse()
    chained = itertools.chain(*list_of_chains)
    return chained
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>In theory you can't because chained objects may even contain infinite sequences such as <code>itertools.count(...)</code>.</p>

<p>You should try to reverse your generators/sequences or use <code>reversed(iterable)</code> for each sequence if applicable and then chain them together last-to-first. Of course this highly depends on your use case.</p>

    return reversed(list(iter))
