<h3>Question (ID-1123337):</h3><h2>Django: Converting an entire set of a Model's objects into a single dictionary</h2><p><em>If you came here from Google looking for model to dict, skip my question, and just jump down to the first answer. My question will only confuse you.</em></p>

<p>Is there a good way in Django to  entire set of a Model's objects into a single dictionary? I mean, like this:</p>

<pre><code>class DictModel(models.Model):
    key = models.CharField(20)
    value = models.CharField(200)


DictModel.objects.all().to_dict()
</code></pre>

<p>... with the result being a dictionary with the key/value pairs made up of records in the Model? Has anyone else seen this as being useful for them?</p>

<p>Thanks.<br />
<br />
<strong>Update</strong><br />
I just wanted to add is that my ultimate goal is to be able to do a simple variable lookup inside a Template. Something like:</p>

<pre><code>{{ DictModel.exampleKey }}
</code></pre>

<p>With a result of DictModel.objects.get(key__exact=exampleKey).value</p>

<p>Overall, though, you guys have really surprised me with how helpful allof your responses are, and how different the ways to approach it can be. Thanks a lot.

<strong>Update October 2011:</strong>
This question is the top result if you Google "django model_to_dict", which is actually pretty awful given that it solves a different problem than what I was asking.<br />
<br />
What I wanted was to be able to map all of the instances in a queryset into a single dictionary with a specified model field as the key.<br />
model_to_dict, on the other hand converts a single model instance into a dictionary.<br />
<br />
Now, my needs at the time were pretty darn specific, and probably extremely rare (I can't even remember the project I needed it for, or why). So I would be pretty surprised that anyone looking for information about model_to_dict is going to find my question actually useful. Sorry.<br />
<br />
model_to_dict seems to be a much more common usage case than I had.

I changed the title to hopefully better reflect my original intent.</p>

model_to_dict(intance, fields=[], exclude=[])

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You want the <code>in_bulk</code> queryset method which, according to the docs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Takes a list of primary-key values and
  returns a dictionary mapping each
  primary-key value to an instance of
  the object with the given ID.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It takes a list of IDs, so you'll need to get that first via the <code>values_list</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>ids = MyModel.objects.values_list('id', flat=True)
model_dict = MyModel.objects.in_bulk(ids)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You are looking for the <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/querysets/#values-fields" rel="nofollow">Values member of QuerySet</a> which allows you to get a list of dictionaries from your query</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Returns a ValuesQuerySet -- a QuerySet
  that evaluates to a list of
  dictionaries instead of model-instance
  objects. Each of those dictionaries represents
  an object, with the keys corresponding
  to the attribute names of model
  objects.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; Blog.objects.values()
[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Beatles Blog', 'tagline': 'All the latest Beatles news.'}],
&gt;&gt;&gt; Blog.objects.values('id', 'name')
[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Beatles Blog'}]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>use </p>

<pre><code>dict(((m.key, m.value) for m in DictModel.objects.all())
</code></pre>

<p>As suggested by Tom Leys, we do not need to get whole object, we can get only those values we need e.g.</p>

<pre><code>dict(((m['key'], m['value']) for m in DictModel.objects.values('key', 'value')))
</code></pre>

<p>and if you need all values, it is better to keep whole object in dict e.g.</p>

<pre><code>dict(((m.key, m) for m in DictModel.objects.all())
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Does this need to create an actual dict? could you get by with only something that looked like a dict?</p>

<pre><code>class DictModelAdaptor():
    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model

    def __getitem__(self, key):
        return self.model.objects.get(key=key)

    def __setitem__(self, key, item):
        pair = self.model()
        pair.key = key
        pair.value = item
        pair.save()

    def __contains__(self, key):
        ...
</code></pre>

<p>You could then wrap a model in this way:</p>

<pre><code>modelDict = DictModelAdaptor(DictModel)
modelDict["name"] = "Bob Jones"
</code></pre>

<p>etc...</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You can use the <code>python</code> <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/serialization" rel="nofollow">serializer</a>:</p>

<pre><code>from django.core import serializers
data = serializers.serialize('python', DictModel.objects.all())
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p><code>dict((x.name, getattr(o, x.name)) for x in o._meta.fields)</code></p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Or were you trying to do something like:</p>

<pre><code>def someview(req):
    models = MyModel.objects.all()
    toTuple = lambda field: (getattr(field, 'someatt'), getattr(field, 'someotheratt'))  
    data = dict(map(toTuple,models))
    return render_to_response(template, data)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>Perhaps I'm missing something, but Django objects have a <strong>dict</strong> attribute which seems be what you want.</p>
