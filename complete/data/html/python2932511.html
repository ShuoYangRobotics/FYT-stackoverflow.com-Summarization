<h3>Question (ID-2932511):</h3><h2>Letter Count on a string</h2><p>Python newb here. I m trying to count the number of letter "a"s in a given string. Code is below. It keeps returning 1 instead 3 in string "banana". Any input appreciated. </p>

<pre><code>def count_letters(word, char):
    count = 0
    while count &lt;= len(word):
        for char in word:
            if char == word[count]:
                count += 1
            return count



print count_letters('banana','a')
</code></pre>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 'banana'.count('a')
3

<hr>

<p>Danben gave this corrected version:</p>

<pre><code>def count_letters(word, char):
  count = 0
  for c in word:
    if char == c:
      count += 1
  return count
</code></pre>

<p>Here are some other ways to do it, hopefully they will teach you more about Python!</p>

<p>Similar, but shorter <code>for</code> loop. Exploits the fact that booleans can turn into 1 if true and 0 if false:</p>

<pre><code>def count_letters(word, char):
  count = 0
  for c in word:
    count += (char == c)
  return count
</code></pre>

<p>Short for loops can generally be turned into list/generator comprehensions. This creates a list of integers corresponding to each letter, with 0 if the letter doesn't match <code>char</code> and 1 if it does, and then sums them:</p>

<pre><code>def count_letters(word, char):
  return sum(char == c for c in word)
</code></pre>

<p>The next one filters out all the characters that don't match <code>char</code>, and counts how many are left:</p>

<pre><code>def count_letters(word, char):
  return len([c for c in word if c == char])
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>One problem is that you are using <code>count</code> to refer both to the position in the word that you are checking, and the number of <code>char</code> you have seen, and you are using <code>char</code> to refer both to the input character you are checking, and the current character in the string.  Use separate variables instead.  </p>

<p>Also, move the <code>return</code> statement outside the loop; otherwise you will always return after checking the first character. </p>

<p>Finally, you only need one loop to iterate over the string.  Get rid of the outer <code>while</code> loop and you will not need to track the position in the string.</p>

<p>Taking these suggestions, your code would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>def count_letters(word, char):
  count = 0
  for c in word:
    if char == c:
      count += 1
  return count
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Your <code>return</code> is in your for loop!  Be careful with indentation, you want the line <code>return count</code> to be outside the loop.  Because the for loop goes through all characters in <code>word</code>, the outer while loop is completely unneeded.</p>

<p>A cleaned-up version:</p>

<pre><code>def count_letters(word, to_find):
    count = 0
    for char in word:
        if char == to_find:
            count += 1
    return count
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I see a few things wrong.</p>

<ol>
<li>You reuse the identifier <code>char</code>, so that will cause issues.</li>
<li>You're saying <code>if char == word[count]</code> instead of <code>word[some index]</code></li>
<li>You return after the first iteration of the for loop!</li>
</ol>

<p>You don't even need the <code>while</code>. If you rename the char param to <code>search</code>,</p>

<pre><code>for char in word:
    if char == search:
        count += 1
return count
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You have a number of problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>There's a problem with your indentation as others already pointed out.</li>
<li>There's no need to have nested loops. Just one loop is enough.</li>
<li>You're using char to mean two different things, but the char variable in the for loop will overwrite the data from the parameter.</li>
</ul>

<p>This code fixes all these errors:</p>

<pre><code>def count_letters(word, char):
    count = 0
    for c in word:
        if char == c:
            count += 1
    return count
</code></pre>

<p>A much more concise way to write this is to use a generator expression:</p>

<pre><code>def count_letters(word, char):
    return sum(char == c for c in word)
</code></pre>

<p>Or just use the built-in method <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#str.count" rel="nofollow">count</a> that does this for you.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Alternatively You can use:</p>

<pre><code>mystring = 'banana'
number = mystring.count('a')
</code></pre>
