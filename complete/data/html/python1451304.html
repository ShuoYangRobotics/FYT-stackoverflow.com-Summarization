<h3>Question (ID-1451304):</h3><h2>Python generators in various languages</h2><p>How do you emulate Python style generators in your favorite language? I found <a href="http://blog.plt-scheme.org/2007/08/control-and-macros.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> one in Scheme. It must be interesting to see other implementations, especially in those languages that don't have first-class continuations. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/library/fiber-based%5Fiterator.aspx" rel="nofollow">Yield Return Iterator for Native C++ Using Fibers</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The "yield return" iterator is a
  language feature that was created for
  one reason: simplicity. It is
  generally much easier to iterate
  across whole collectionl, storing all
  context needed in local variables,
  rather than crafting a complicated,
  custom iterator object that stores its
  state across subsequent retrieval
  operations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are also the <em>primitive</em> C routines <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setjmp/longjmp" rel="nofollow">setjmp, longjmp</a> to achieve similar results.<br />
(Lua <a href="http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#2.11" rel="nofollow">coroutines</a> are implemented with the above method)</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><strong>I wouldn't use yield at all in Lisp/Scheme.</strong></p>

<p>'yield' requires some kind of co-routine or continuation facility in the language. Many uses of yield can be implemented in a simpler functional way.</p>

<p>YIELD is basically related to the famous COME-FROM operator. ;-) Here, a call in some place can lead to different places in some other routine, depending on its execution context. So a routine suddenly has multiple entry points whose order is determined at runtime. For simple uses this may be fine, but I would argue that for more complex code reasoning about the code would get harder.</p>

<p>Take the Scheme example linked in the question:</p>

<pre><code>(define/y (step) 
  (yield 1)
  (yield 2)
  (yield 3)
  'finished)

(list (step) (step) (step))
</code></pre>

<p>Calling (step) multiple times returns different values then.</p>

<p>I would just create a closure:</p>

<pre><code>(define step
  (let ((state '(1 2 3 finished)))
    (lambda ()
      (pop state))))
</code></pre>

<p>This breaks above function with a yield into two different things: a variable that carries the state and a simple function that changes the state. The state is no longer implicitly coded into the execution sequence.</p>

<pre><code> (list (step) (step) (step))))
</code></pre>

<p>One can imagine similar solutions for other uses of yield.</p>

<p>Compare that with the <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/cltl/clm/node364.html#SECTION003520000000000000000" rel="nofollow">generators from the Common Lisp SERIES library</a>:</p>

<pre><code>(let ((x (generator (scan '(1 2 3 finished)))))
  (list (next-in x)
        (next-in x)
        (next-in x)))
</code></pre>

<p>If we look at this Python example from another answer</p>

<pre><code>def simpleRange(n):
    for i in xrange(n):
        yield i

for n in simpleRange(5):
     print(n)
</code></pre>

<p>we can see that it duplicates the control structure. Both the calling place and the generator use a FOR iteration control structure. Using closures, we can get rid of the use of control structures inside the generator, by only providing the state transition code.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Understanding%5Fmonads" rel="nofollow">Monads</a> can be used to represent generators (even if the semantics are little different).</p>

<p>So any language allowing us to define monadic operations within a special syntax can be used here.</p>

<ul>
<li>VB.NET/C# (Linq - but C# already got <code>yield return</code>)</li>
<li>Scala (For-comprehensions)</li>
<li>Haskell (do-notation)</li>
<li>F#/OCaml (Computation expressions/Perform)</li>
</ul>

<p>Ruby can emulate generators through its builtin continuation capabilities.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>In JavaScript 1.7+ I usually only have to add a few parentheses and brackets. Everything else is about the same. JavaScript 1.7 introduced pythonic generators and iterators among other things.</p>

<h2>Generator expressions:</h2>

<pre><code># Python
(x + 1 for x in y if x &gt; 100)

// JavaScript 1.8+
(x + 1 for (x in y) if (x &gt; 100))
</code></pre>

<h2>Generators</h2>

<pre><code># Python
def simpleRange(n):
    for i in xrange(n):
        yield i

for n in simpleRange(5):
     print(n)


// JavaScript 1.7+
function simpleRange(n) {
    for (let i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
        yield i;
}

for (n in simpleRange(5))
    print(n);
</code></pre>

<h2>List/Array comprehensions</h2>

<pre><code># Python
[x + 1 for x in y if x &gt; 100]

// JavaScript 1.7+
[x + 1 for (x in y) if (x &gt; 100)]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Common Lisp, although does not have native continuations, allows to create delimited continuations using CPS transformers like <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-cont/" rel="nofollow">cl-cont</a>. So generators in Common Lisp can be written in pretty much the same way as Scheme generators.</p>

<p>By the way, continuation-based generators have one trait that Python and C# generators lack: the <code>yield</code> may be called in the dynamic extent of the generator function call. Python and C# generators allow <code>yield</code> to be placed only inside the body of a generator.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Ruby:</p>

<p>Generator function:</p>

<pre><code>def simple_range(n)
    Enumerator.new do |y|    
        (0..n).each { |v| y.yield(v) }
    end
end
</code></pre>
