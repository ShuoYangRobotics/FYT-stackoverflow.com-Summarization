<h3>Question (ID-551038):</h3><h2>"Private" (implementation) class in Python</h2><p>I am coding a small Python module composed of two parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>some functions defining a public interface,</li>
<li>an implementation class used by the above functions, but which is not meaningful outside the module.</li>
</ul>

<p>At first, I decided to "hide" this implementation class by defining it inside the function using it, but this hampers readability and cannot be used if multiple functions reuse the same class.</p>

<p>So, in addition to comments and docstrings, is there a mechanism to mark a class as "private" or "internal"? I am aware of the underscore mechanism, but as I understand it it only applies to variables, function and methods name.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Use a single underscore prefix:</p>

<pre><code>class _Internal:
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>This is the official Python convention for 'internal' symbols; "from module import *" does not import underscore-prefixed objects.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>In short:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>You cannot enforce privacy</strong>. There are no private classes/methods/functions in Python. At least, not strict privacy as in other languages, such as Java. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>You can only indicate/suggest privacy</strong>. This follows a convention. The python convention for marking a class/function/method as private is to preface it with an _ (underscore). For example, <code>def _myfunc()</code> or <code>class _MyClass:</code>. You can also create pseudo-privacy by prefacing the method with two underscores (eg: <code>__foo</code>). You cannot access the method directly, but you can still call it through a special prefix using the classname (eg: <code>_classname__foo</code>). So the best you can do is indicate/suggest privacy, not enforce it.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Python is like perl in this respect. To paraphrase a famous line about privacy from the Perl book, the philosophy is that you should stay of the living room because you weren't invited, not because it is defended with a shotgun.</p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Define <code>__all__</code>, a list of names that you want to be exported (<a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/modules.html#importing-from-a-package" rel="nofollow">see documentation</a>).</p>

<pre><code>__all__ = ['public_class'] # don't add here the 'implementation_class'
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The convention is prepend "_" to internal classes, functions, and variables.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>A pattern that I sometimes use is this:</p>

<p>Define a class:</p>

<pre><code>class x(object):
    def doThis(self):
        ...
    def doThat(self):
        ...
</code></pre>

<p>Create an instance of the class, overwriting the class name:</p>

<pre><code>x = x()
</code></pre>

<p>Define symbols that expose the functionality:</p>

<pre><code>doThis = x.doThis
doThat = x.doThat
</code></pre>

<p>Delete the instance itself:</p>

<pre><code>del x
</code></pre>

<p>Now you have a module that only exposes your public functions.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>To address the issue of design conventions, and as Christopher said, there's really no such thing as "private" in Python. This may sound twisted for someone coming from C/C++ background (like me a while back), but eventually, you'll probably realize following conventions is plenty enough. </p>

<p>Seeing something having an underscore in front should be a good enough hint not to use it directly. If you're concerned with cluttering <code>help(MyClass)</code> output (which is what everyone looks at when searching on how to use a class), the underscored attributes/classes are not included there, so you'll end up just having your "public" interface described.</p>

<p>Plus, having everything public has its own awesome perks, like for instance, you can unit test pretty much anything from outside (which you can't really do with C/C++ private constructs).</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Use two underscores to prefix names of "private" identifiers. For classes in a module, use a single leading underscore and they will not be imported using "from module import *".</p>

<pre><code>class _MyInternalClass:
    def __my_private_method:
        pass
</code></pre>

<p>(There is no such thing as true "private" in Python. For example, Python just automatically mangles the names of class members with double underscores to be <code>__clssname_mymember</code>. So really, if you know the mangled name you can use the "private" entity anyway. <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/classes.html#private-variables" rel="nofollow">See here.</a> And of course you can choose to manually import "internal" classes if you wanted to).</p>
