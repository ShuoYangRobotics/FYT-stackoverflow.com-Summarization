<h3>Question (ID-2885502):</h3><h2>C++ Structure within itself?</h2><p>I've been trying to port this code to python, but there is something I do not quite understand in C++ (I do know a bit of C++ but this is beyond me):</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct huffnode_s
{
    struct huffnode_s *zero;
    struct huffnode_s *one;
    unsigned char val;
    float freq;
} huffnode_t;
</code></pre>

<p>What I don't get is how huffnode_s can be within itself, I've never seen this before and don't quite understand it. What does this mean, and if someone can, what would be the python equivalent?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p><code>huffnode_s</code> isn't within itself, only <em>pointers</em> to <code>huffnode_s</code> are in there.  Since a pointer is of known size, it's no problem.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>This.</p>

<pre><code>class Huffnode(object):
    def __init__(self, zero, one, val, freq):
        """zero and one are Huffnode's, val is a 'char' and freq is a float."""
        self.zero = zero
        self.one = one
        self.val = val
        self.freq = freq
</code></pre>

<p>You can then refactor your various C functions to be methods of this class.</p>

<p>Or maybe this.</p>

<pre><code>from collections import namedtuple
Huffnode = namedtuple( 'Huffnode', [ 'zero', 'one', 'val', 'freq' ] )
</code></pre>

<p>If you want your C functions to remain functions.</p>

<p>That's it.</p>

<pre><code>h0 = Huffnode(None, None, 'x', 0.0)
h1 = Huffnode(None, None, 'y', 1.0)
h2 = Huffnode(h0, h1, 'z', 2.0)
</code></pre>

<p>That's all that's required.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>it does not have a structure in itself. it has a pointer to that structure. </p>

<p>in memory <strong>struct huffnode_s</strong> would look like (32 bit machine):</p>

<hr>

<p>|------------------ huffnode_s* zero - 4 bytes --------------| </p>

<p>|------------------ huffnode_s* one - 4 bytes----------------| </p>

<p>|unsigned char val - 1 byte + 3 bytes padding=======| </p>

<p>|------------------- float freq - 4 bytes -------------------------|  </p>

<hr>

<p>these sizes would vary machine to machine, and how it looks in memory is decided by compiler .</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>As others have noted, the references to itself are simply pointers to other instances of that structure.</p>

<p>The pointers within the structure would allow one to connect instances together as a linked list.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>(struct huffnode_s *) declares a pointer to another structure that includes same variables as the structure that it's declared in. See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35988/c-like-structures-in-python">this question</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>This is a pointer to a huffnode inside of a huffnode.  What this means is that you can say:</p>

<pre><code>huffnode_t *node = ...;
huffnode_t *greatgreatgreatgrandchild = node-&gt;zero-&gt;zero-&gt;zero-&gt;zero-&gt;zero;
</code></pre>

<p>This will compile, and it will work as long as all those huffnode descendents are actually allocated and pointed to correctly.</p>

<p>Pointers are much like object references in JavaScript.  They don't actually contain data, they just refer to it.  Rest assured that you are not looking at an infinite type.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>To add to Carl's answer, the same thing in C++ is also possible:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo {
public:
    Foo() {}

    Foo *anotherFoo;
};   
</code></pre>

<p>(Note the above class is silly, but the point is you can have a pointer inside a class that is of the class type)</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>This is known as a self referential structure and it is exactly what it sounds like: a structure which contains a reference to itself. A common occurrence of this is in a structure which describes a node for a linked list. Each node needs a reference to the next node in the chain. </p>

<pre><code>struct linked_list_node { 
    int data; 
    struct linked_list_node *next; // &lt;- self reference 
}; 
</code></pre>
