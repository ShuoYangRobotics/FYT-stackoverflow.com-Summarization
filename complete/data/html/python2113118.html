<h3>Question (ID-2113118):</h3><h2>sum of bytes with unsigned long overflow in python</h2><p>how to translate this piece of C code into Python >=2.6 ?</p>

<pre><code>unsigned long memSum(unsigned char *p, unsigned long len)
{
   unsigned long i, sum=0;

   for(i=0; i&lt;len; i++) 
      sum = sum + *p++;

   return sum;
}  
</code></pre>

<p>of course</p>

<pre><code>f=open("file_to_sum",'rb')
m = f.read()
f.close()
sum( array.array('B', m) )
</code></pre>

<p>does not work</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>If you need to wrap around on overflow, simply take your sum modulo MAX_LONG at the end.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>A direct, Pythonic translation:</p>

<pre><code>def memSum(data):
    return sum(ord(c) for c in data) &amp; 0xFFFFFFFF
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>As I mentioned in my comment, you need to convert the string into a <code>list</code> of <code>int</code>s.
This probably what you want:</p>

<pre><code>f=open("infile.txt",'rb')
m=f.read()
f.close()
m=map(ord,list(m))
print sum(m)
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>ord</code> function returns the ascii <code>int</code> corresponding to a character.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I've tried your code, and seems to be working (it opens the data in binary, convert it to a list of unsigned char and adds all). </p>

<p>What is your problem? Could be an overflow problem? Maybe there is a problem with the length? How are you saving the file?
Sorry, but with this information we can only guess!</p>

<p>The code is not equivalent, as the Python code seems to deal with files and the C code seems to deal with a memory array.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You really need to give an example input and what you expect as output. Any code that uses a recent version of Python, extracts an integer in range(256) from each byte, sums those integers, and finally does <code>total &amp;= 0xFFFFFFFF</code> should do the job (assuming that your <code>unsigned long</code> is 32 bits wide).</p>

<p>Note that the last step ( the <code>&amp;=</code>) is pointless if your file is less than about 16MB in size ... it won't overflow; 16843009 * 255 &lt;= 0xFFFFFFFF &lt; (16843009 + 1) * 255</p>

<p>That means that if your test file is smaller than 16843010 bytes, you must have a problem in your C code or your Python code or both.</p>

<p>You said that "of course" this code:</p>

<pre><code>f=open("file_to_sum",'rb')
m = f.read()
f.close()
sum( array.array('B', m) )
</code></pre>

<p>"doesn't work". Does it work if you replace the last line by </p>

<pre><code>print sum( array.array('B', m) )
</code></pre>

<p>?</p>

<p>If none of the above is of any help, and you want sensible answers instead of guesses, provide example input, expected output, C code, C output, Python code, Python output. Both the C code and the Python code should be standalone-runnable, and should include printing the size of the byte array being summed.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>first, thank you all for your help</p>

<p>I have written successfully the C implementation and tested over 20 different files the checksum function. And then the 2 complement of the computed checksum is compared to a checksum a the file. It works perfectly in C as mentionned: with unsigned char and unsigned long.</p>

<p>the right value of the sum is 3da4be70 (from C implementation)
from your suggestions:</p>

<pre><code>print '%x' % ( sum( array.array('B', m[ o2+4:o2+len2 ]) ) )
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>n = map(ord, list(m[ o2+4: o2+len2 ]))
print '%x' % (sum(n))
</code></pre>

<p>give 504a022a</p>

<p>I suppose it is because bytes here in python as interpreted as signed instead of unsigned (like in C)...</p>

<p>update:</p>

<p>even</p>

<pre><code>for i in range(o2+4, o2+len2):
 cchk = ( (cchk + unpack('B', m[i])[0]) &amp; 0xffffffff)
print '%x' % (cchk)
</code></pre>

<p>does not work and gives again 504a022a</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>SOLVED : MY FAULT, SORRY</p>

<pre><code>#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;

unsigned long memSum(unsigned char *p, unsigned long len)
{
   unsigned long i, sum=0;

   for(i=0; i&lt;len; i++) 
      sum = sum + *p++;

   return sum;
}  

#define LEN2SUM (0xa13b10-4)

int main(int argc, char *argv[] )
{

  FILE *f;
  unsigned char *buf;
  unsigned long sum;

  f=fopen("test2.dat", "rb");
  fseek(f, 0x7c+4, SEEK_SET); 

  buf = (unsigned char*)malloc(LEN2SUM);
  fread(buf, sizeof(char), LEN2SUM, f);
  sum = memSum( buf, LEN2SUM);
  printf("0x%08x\n", sum );

  free(buf);  
  fclose(f);


}
</code></pre>

<p>and </p>

<pre><code>f = open('test2.dat','rb')
f.seek(0x7c+4)

m = f.read(0xa13b10-4)
print '%x' % ( ( sum(ord(c) for c in m) &amp; 0xFFFFFFFF ) )
</code></pre>

<p>give the same answer, the good one</p>

<p>the difference is that in C, i checksum a given memory area which contains decrypted data, where decryption has been done 'in place'</p>

<p>in my python implementation, decryption is done in another buffer, and I still checksum the encrypted area.</p>

<p>since my a beginner in python, I was focused on this point : bad track.
i'm kicking my ass twenty times.....</p>

<p>sorry for the stupid question and thanks again your kind help !!!</p>
