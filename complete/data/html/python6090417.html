<h3>Question (ID-6090417):</h3><h2>Detect last iteration over dictionary.iteritems() in python</h2><p>Is there a simple way to detect the last iteration while iterating over a dictionary using <code>iteritems()</code>?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-9):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>There is an ugly way to do this:</p>

<pre><code>for i, (k, v) in enumerate(your_dict.iteritems()):
    if i == len(your_dict)-1:
        # do special stuff here
</code></pre>

<p>But you should really consider if you need this. I am almost certain that there is another way.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><pre><code>it = spam_dict.iteritems()
try:
    eggs1 = it.next()
    while True:
        eggs2 = it.next()
        do_something(eggs1)
        eggs1 = eggs2
except StopIteration:
    do_final(eggs1)
</code></pre>

<p>Quick and quite dirty. Does it solve your issue?</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>as others have stated, dictionaries have no defined order, so it's hard to imagine why you would need this, but here it is</p>

<pre><code>last = None
for current in your_dict.iteritems():
  if last is not None:
    # process last
  last = current

# now last contains the last thing in dict.iteritems()
if last is not None: # this could happen if the dict was empty
  # process the last item
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I recently had this issue, I thought this was the most elegant solution because it allowed you to write <code>for i,value,isLast in lastEnumerate(...):</code>:</p>

<pre><code>def lastEnumerate(iterator):
    x = list(iterator)
    for i,value in enumerate(x):
        yield i,value,i==len(x)-1
</code></pre>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>for i,value,isLast in lastEnumerate(range(5)):
    print(value)
    if not isLast:
        print(',')
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>This is a special case of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/5983265/577088">this broader question</a>. My suggestion was to create an <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5983265/pythonic-way-of-determining-if-the-current-element-is-the-first-or-last-element-o/5983613#5983613">enumerate-like generator</a> that returns -1 on the last item:</p>

<pre><code>def annotate(gen):
    prev_i, prev_val = 0, gen.next()
    for i, val in enumerate(gen, start=1):
        yield prev_i, prev_val
        prev_i, prev_val = i, val
    yield '-1', prev_val
</code></pre>

<p>Add <code>gen = iter(gen)</code> if you want it to handle sequences as well as generators.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>The approach that makes the most sense is to wrap the loop in some call which contains a hook to call your post-iteration funtionality afterwards.</p>

<p>This could be implemented as context manager and called through a 'with' statement or, for older versions of Python, you could use the old 'try:' ... 'finally:' construct.  It could also be wrapped in a class where the dictionary iteration is self dispatched (a "private" method) and the appendix code follows that in the public method.  (Understanding that the distention between public vs private is a matter of intention and documentation, not enforced by Python).</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>The last item in a for loop hangs around after the for loop anyway:</p>

<pre><code>for current_item in my_dict:
    do_something(current_item)

try:
    do_last(current_item)
except NameError:
    print "my_dict was empty"
</code></pre>

<p>Even if the name "current_item" is in use before the for loop, attempting to loop over an empty dict seems to have the effect of deleting current_item, hence the NameError</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>You stated in an above comment that you need this to construct the WHERE clause of an SQL SELECT statement.  Perhaps this will help:</p>

<pre><code>def make_filter(colname, value):
    if isinstance(value, str):
        if '%' in value:
            return "%s LIKE '%s'" % (colname, value)
        else:
            return "%s = '%s'" % (colname, value)
    return "%s = %s" % (colname, value)

filters = {'USER_ID':'123456', 'CHECK_NUM':23459, 'CHECK_STATUS':'C%'}
whereclause = 'WHERE '+'\nAND '.join(make_filter(*x) for x in filters.iteritems())
print whereclause
</code></pre>

<p>which prints</p>

<pre><code>WHERE CHECK_NUM = 23459
AND CHECK_STATUS LIKE 'C%'
AND USER_ID = '123456'
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>No. When using an iterator you do not know anything about the position - actually, the iterator could be infinite.</p>

<p>Besides that, a dictionary is <strong>not ordered</strong>. So if you need it e.g. to insert commas between the elements you should take the items, sort them and them iterate over the list of <code>(key, value)</code> tuples. And when iterating over this list you can easily count the number of iterations and thus know when you have the last element.</p>
