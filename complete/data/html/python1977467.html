<h3>Question (ID-1977467):</h3><h2>2 dimensional interpolation problem</h2><p>I have DATA on x and y axes and the output is on z</p>

<p>for example</p>

<pre><code>y = 10
x = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
z = [2.3,3.4,5.6,7.8,9.6,11.2]

y = 20 
x = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
z = [4.3,5.4,7.6,9.8,11.6,13.2]

y = 30 
x = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
z = [6.3,7.4,8.6,10.8,13.6,15.2]
</code></pre>

<p>how can i find the value of z when  y = 15  x = 3.5</p>

<p>I was trying to use scipy but i am very new at it </p>

<p>Thanks a lot for the help </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>Upper solution does not give you perfect fit. 
check   </p>

<pre><code>print interpolate.bisplev(x,y,tck)

[[  2.2531746    4.2531746    6.39603175]
 [  3.54126984   5.54126984   7.11269841]
 [  5.5031746    7.5031746    8.78888889]
 [  7.71111111   9.71111111  10.9968254 ]
 [  9.73730159  11.73730159  13.30873016]
 [ 11.15396825  13.15396825  15.2968254 ]]
</code></pre>

<p>to overcome this interpolate whit polyinomials of 5rd degree in x and 2nd degree in y direction  </p>

<pre><code>tck = interpolate.bisplrep(X,Y,Z,kx=5,ky=2)
print interpolate.bisplev(x,y,tck) 

[[  2.3   4.3   6.3]
 [  3.4   5.4   7.4]
 [  5.6   7.6   8.6]
 [  7.8   9.8  10.8]
 [  9.6  11.6  13.6]
 [ 11.2  13.2  15.2]]

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Given (not as Python code, since the second assignment would obliterate the first in each case, of course;-):</p>

<pre><code>y = 10
x = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
z = [2.3,3.4,5.6,7.8,9.6,11.2]

y = 20 
x = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
z = [4.3,5.4,7.6,9.8,11.6,13.2]
</code></pre>

<p>you ask: "how can i find the value of z when y = 15 x = 3.5"?</p>

<p>Since you're looking at a point exactly equidistant in both x and y from the given "grid", you just take the midpoint between the grid values (if you had values not equidistant, you'd take a proportional midpoint, see later).  So for y=10, the z values for x 3 and 4 are 5.6 and 7.8, so for x 3.5 you estimate their midpoint, 6.7; and similarly for y=20 you estimate the midpoint between 7.6 and 9.8, i.e., 8.7.  Finally, since you have y=15, the midpoint between 6.7 and 8.7 is your final interpolated value for z: 7.7.</p>

<p>Say you had y=13 and x=3.8 instead.  Then for x you'd take the values 80% of the way, i.e.:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>for y=10, 0.2*5.6+0.8*7.8 -> 7.36</p></li>
<li><p>for y=20, 0.2*7.6+0.8*9.8 -> 9.46</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now you want the z 30% of the way between these, 0.3*7.36 + 0.7*9.46 -> 8.83, that's z.</p>

<p>This is <strong>linear interpolation</strong>, and it's really very simple.  Do you want to compute it by hand, or find routines that do it for you (given e.g. <code>numpy</code> arrays as "the grids")?  Even in the latter case, I hope this "manual" explanation (showing what you're doing in the most elementary of arithmetical terms) can help you understand what you're doing...;-).</p>

<p>There are more advanced forms of interpolation, of course -- do you need those, or does linear interpolation suffice for your use case?</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Any one who can help , I think it is very basic but i am not getting it </p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>What is the function that generates z.  What is the relation between x, y and z.  What language are you using?</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I would say just take the average of the values around it.  So if you need X=3.5 and Y=15 (3.5,15), you average (3,10), (3,20), (4,10) and (4,20).  Since I have no idea what the data is you are dealing with, I am not sure if the exact proximity would matter - in which case you can just stick w/the average - or if you need to do some sort of inverse distance weighting.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I am using python </p>

<p>Z is the delays of a gate in circuit 
x is the load on the gate 
y is the rise time at the input </p>

<p>so for every rise time i will be having 6 different loads and therefore 6 different delays </p>

<p>There is some what linear relation ship but not exactly linear </p>
