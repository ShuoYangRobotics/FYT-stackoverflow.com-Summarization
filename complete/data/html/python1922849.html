<h3>Question (ID-1922849):</h3><h2>Boolean Query</h2><p>if:</p>

<pre><code>x = 0
b = x==0
</code></pre>

<p>and i print be it would print 'true'</p>

<p>but if i did:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>x = 0<br>
  b = x ==3</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and i printed be it would be false.
In stead of it printing false how would i take the boolean value 'b' to print what text i wanted?</p>

<p>let me explain further:</p>

<pre><code>bool = all(n &gt; 0 for n in list) 

if bool != 'True':
    print 'a value is not greater than zero'
</code></pre>

<p>But it prints nothing?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Something like this you mean?</p>

<pre><code>x = 0
if x != 3:
    print "x does not equal 3"
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I think perhaps the following will help alleviate some of your confusion...</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 0==0
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'True'
'True'
&gt;&gt;&gt; (0==0) == 'True'
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; (0==0) == True
True
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>An <code>if</code> statement as other answers suggest is a possibility (and you could add an <code>else</code> clause to print something specific in each case). More direct is an <code>if/else</code> <em>operator</em>:</p>

<pre><code>print('equality' if b else 'diversity')
</code></pre>

<p>You could also use indexing, since False has the int value 0 and True the int value 1:</p>

<pre><code>print(['different', 'the same'][b])
</code></pre>

<p>but I find that a bit less readable than the <code>if</code> variants.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Remove the quotes around True:</p>

<pre><code>bool = all(n &gt; 0 for n in list) 

if bool != True:
    print 'a value is not greater than zero'
</code></pre>

<p>or, you can also check for False:</p>

<pre><code>bool = all(n &gt; 0 for n in list) 

if bool == False:
    print 'a value is not greater than zero'
</code></pre>

<p>There are several other "shortcut" ways of writing it, but since you're a beginner let's not confuse the subject more than necessary.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; if not x == 3: print 'x does not equal 3'
x does not equal 3
</code></pre>

<p>lte me explain further:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; list = [-1, 1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; if not all(n &gt; 0 for n in list): print 'a value is not greater than zero'
a value is not greater than zero

# =&gt; or shorter ...
&gt;&gt;&gt; if min(list) &lt; 0: print 'a value is not greater than zero'
a value is not greater than zero
</code></pre>

<p>note that <code>list</code> is a builtin and shouldn't be used as a variable name.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; list
&lt;type 'list'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; list = [1, 2, "value not greater than 0"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; list
[1, 2, "value not greater than 0"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; del list
&gt;&gt;&gt; list
&lt;type 'list'&gt;
...
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><pre><code>a = lambda b :("not true","true")[b == 3]
print a(3)
</code></pre>

<p>will do it for you if you want to put it in a lambda</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>You will need to do the printing yourself, as everyone suggested here.</p>

<p>It's worthy to note that some languages (e.g. Scala, Ruby, Groovy) have language features that enable you to write:</p>

<pre><code>x should be(3)
</code></pre>

<p>And that will report:</p>

<pre><code>0 should be 3 but is not.
</code></pre>

<p>In Groovy, with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/spock" rel="nofollow">Spock testing framework</a>, you can write:</p>

<pre><code>def "my test":
  when: x = 0
  expect: x == 3
</code></pre>

<p>And that would output:</p>

<p>Condition not satisfied:</p>

<pre><code>x == 3
| |  |
0 |  3
 false
</code></pre>

<p>I don't think this possibly cleanly in python though.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 'True' is not True
True
</code></pre>

<p>'True' is a string</p>

<p>True is a boolean</p>

<p>They have nothing to do with each other, except coincidentally.  The string value happens to have the same letters as the boolean literal.  But that's just a coincidence.</p>
