<h3>Question (ID-119198):</h3><h2>Is it good to switch from c# to python?</h2><p>Currently I am developing in the .Net environment using C# but I want to know whether it is worth learning python. I'm thinking of learning the Django framework. What is better?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Yes, you should learn Python, but it has nothing to do with Python or C# being better.  It is really about making you a better programmer.</p>

<p>Learning Python will give you a whole new perspective on programmer and how problems can be solved.  It's like lifting weights, except you're building up the developer muscles in your mind.  </p>

<p>For example, if you've only ever programmed using a statically typed language then it is hard to imagine any other way.  Learning Python will teach you that there is an alternative in the form of dynamic typing.</p>

<p>For a summary of Pythons benefits:

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Personally I feel you can write good/bad code in any language. I also firmly believe in learning a <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6536" rel="nofollow">new language every so often</a> for the sake of learning itself. On those grounds I say if you have the time just go for it. Python is a great language that many others are inspired from.</p>

<p>Whether one framework or language is better or not depends on your definition of better. Do you want more work as a programmer? Do you want to develop business apps quickly, or do you want to compute 3D matrix transformations? </p>

<p>Once you've answered those questions you might find yourself taking a completely different direction, say F# if you had particular interest in the financial or scientific sector.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>It can't hurt to learn Python, especially considering some of the heavy weights (Google) are really getting behind it.</p>

<p>As for the actual use, it all depends on the application.  Use the best tool for the job.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Depends on what you will use it for. If you're making enterprise Windows forms applications, I don't think switching to Python would be a good idea.</p>

<p>Also, it is possible to still use Python on the .NET CLR with IronPython.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Both are useful for different purposes.  C# is a pretty good all-rounder, python's dynamic nature makes it more suitable for RAD experiences such as site building.  </p>

<p>I don't think your career will suffer if you were competant in both.  To get going with Python consider an IDE with Python support such as Eclipse+PyDev or ActiveIDE's Komodo.  (I found a subscription to Safari Bookshelf online really invaluable too!)</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>What's better is inherently subjective. If you like Python's syntax - learn it. It will probably be harder to find a Python job, C# and .NET in general seem to be more popular, but this may change.</p>

<p>I also think it's worth to know at least one scripting language, even if your main job doesn't require it. Python is not a bad candidate.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Never stop learning! </p>

<p>That said, how can you compare the two? How good is Python support in .Net? Is there C# support in Google App Engine? It really depends what your target system is. Therefore, the more languages you have the better equipped you will be to tackle different challenges.</p>
