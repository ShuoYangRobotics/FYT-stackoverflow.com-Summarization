<h3>Question (ID-3494615):</h3><h2>Python List Help</h2><p>I have a list of lists that looks like:</p>

<pre><code>floodfillque = [[1,1,e],[1,2,w], [1,3,e], [2,1,e], [2,2,e], [2,3,w]]

for each in floodfillque:
    if each[2] == 'w':
        floodfillque.remove(each)
    else:
        tempfloodfill.append(floodfillque[each[0+1][1]])
</code></pre>

<p>That is a simplified, but I think relevant part of the code.</p>

<p>Does the <code>floodfillque[each[0+1]]</code> part do what I think it is doing and taking the value at that location and adding one to it or no?  The reason why I ask is I get this error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TypeError: 'int' object is unsubscriptable</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I think I am misunderstanding what that code is actually doing or doing it wrong.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>In addition to the bug in your code that other answers have already spotted, you have at least one more:</p>

<pre><code>for each in floodfillque:
    if each[2] == 'w':
        floodfillque.remove(each)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>don't add or remove items from the very container you're looping on</strong>.  While such a bug will usually be diagnosed only for certain types of containers (not including lists), it's just as terrible for lists -- it will end up altering your intended semantics by skipping some items or seeing some items twice.</p>

<p>If you can't substantially alter and enhance your logic (generally by building a new, separate container rather than mucking with the one you're looping on), the simplest workaround is usually to loop on a <strong>copy</strong> of the container you must alter:</p>

<pre><code>for each in list(floodfillque):
</code></pre>

<p>Now, your additions and removals won't alter what you're actually looping on (because what you're looping on is a copy, a "snapshot", made once and for all at loop's start) so your semantics will work as intended.</p>

<p>Your specific approach to altering <code>floodfillque</code> also has a <strong>performance</strong> bug -- it behaves quadratically, while sound logic (building a new container rather than altering the original one) would behave linearly.  But, that bug is harder to fix without refactoring your code from the current not-so-nice logic to the new, well-founded one.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Here's what's happening:</p>

<p>On the first iteration of the loop, <code>each</code> is <code>[1, 1, 'e']</code>. Since <code>each[2] != 'w'</code>, the <code>else</code> is executed.</p>

<p>In the <code>else</code>, you take <code>each[0+1][1]</code>, which is the same as <code>(each[0+1])[1]</code>. <code>each[0+1]</code> is <code>1</code>, and so you are doing <code>(1)[1]</code>. <code>int</code> objects can't be indexed, which is what's raising the error.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><blockquote>
  <p>Does the floodfillque[each[0+1] part

  one to it or no? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it sounds like you want <code>each[0] + 1</code>.  </p>

<p>Either way, the error you're getting is because you're trying to take the second item of an integer... <code>each[0+1][1]</code> resolves to <code>each[1][1]</code> which might be something like <code>3[1]</code>, which doesn't make any sense.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The other posters are correct. However, there is another bug in this code, which is that you are modifying <code>floodfillque</code> as you are iterating over it. This will cause problems, because Python internally maintains a counter to handle the loop, and deleting elements does not modify the counter.</p>

<p>The safe way to do this is to iterate of a copy of the loop:</p>

<pre><code>for each in floodfillque[ : ]:
</code></pre>

<p>(<code>[ : ]</code> is Python's notation for a copy.)</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Here is how I understand NoahClark's intentions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Remove those sublists whose third element is 'w'</li>
<li>For the remaining sublist, add 1 to the second item</li>
</ol>

<p>If this is the case, the following will do:</p>

<pre><code># Here is the original list
floodfillque = [[1,1,'e'], [1,2,'w'], [1,3,'e'], [2,1,'e'], [2,2,'e'], [2,3,'w']]

# Remove those sublists which have 'w' as the third element
# For the rest, add one to the second element
floodfillque = [[a,b+1,c] for a,b,c in floodfillque if c != 'w']
</code></pre>

<p>This solution works fine, but it is not the most efficient: it creates a new list instead of patching up the original one.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I don't really understand the question, but:</p>

<p><code>each[0+1]</code> is exactly the same as <code>each[1]</code>, simply because <code>0+1</code> is <code>1</code>. So  I think there is something wrong with <code>each[0+1]</code>.</p>
