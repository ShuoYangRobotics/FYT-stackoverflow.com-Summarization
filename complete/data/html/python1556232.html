<h3>Question (ID-1556232):</h3><h2>How to select an item from a list with known percentages in Python</h2><p>I wish to select a random word from a list where the is a known chance for each word, for example:</p>

<p>Fruit with Probability </p>

<p>Orange 0.10 
Apple  0.05
Mango  0.15 
etc</p>

<p>How would be the best way of implementing this? The actual list I will take from is up to 100 items longs and the % do not all tally to 100 % they do fall short to account for the items that had a really low chance of occurrence. I would ideally like to take this from a CSV which is where I store this data. This is not a time critical task.</p>

<p>Thank you for any advice on how best to proceed.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You can pick items with weighted probabilities if you assign each item a number range proportional to its probability, pick a random number between zero and the sum of the ranges and find what item matches it. The following class does exactly that:</p>

<pre><code>from random import random

class WeightedChoice(object):
    def __init__(self, weights):
        """Pick items with weighted probabilities.

            weights
                a sequence of tuples of item and it's weight.
        """
        self._total_weight = 0.
        self._item_levels = []
        for item, weight in weights:
            self._total_weight += weight
            self._item_levels.append((self._total_weight, item))

    def pick(self):
        pick = self._total_weight * random()
        for level, item in self._item_levels:
            if level &gt;= pick:
                return item
</code></pre>

<p>You can then load the CSV file with the <code>csv</code> module and feed it to the <code>WeightedChoice</code> class:</p>

<pre><code>import csv

weighed_items = [(item,float(weight)) for item,weight in csv.reader(open('file.csv'))]
picker = WeightedChoice(weighed_items)
print(picker.pick())
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><pre><code>lst = [ ('Orange', 0.10), ('Apple', 0.05), ('Mango', 0.15), ('etc', 0.69) ]

x = 0.0
lst2 = []
for fruit, chance in lst:
    tup = (x, fruit)
    lst2.append(tup)
    x += chance

tup = (x, None)
lst2.append(tup)

import random

def pick_one(lst2):
    if lst2[0][1] is None:
        raise ValueError, "no valid values to choose"
    while True:
        r = random.random()
        for x, fruit in reversed(lst2):
            if x &lt;= r:
                if fruit is None:
                    break  # try again with a different random value
                else:
                    return fruit

pick_one(lst2)
</code></pre>

<p>This builds a new list, with ascending values representing the range of values that choose a fruit; then pick_one() walks backward down the list, looking for a value that is &lt;= the current random value.  We put a "sentinel" value on the end of the list; if the values don't reach 1.0, there is a chance of a random value that shouldn't match anything, and it will match the sentinel value and then be rejected.  random.random() returns a random value in the range [0.0, 1.0) so it is certain to match something in the list eventually.</p>

<p>The nice thing here is that you should be able to have one value with a 0.000001 chance of matching, and it should actually match with that frequency; the other solutions, where you make a list with the items repeated and just use random.choice() to choose one, would require a list with a million items in it to handle this case.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>What you want is to draw from a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial%5Fdistribution" rel="nofollow">multinomial distribution</a>. Assuming you have two lists of items and probabilities, and the probabilities sum to 1 (if not, just add some default value to cover the extra):</p>

<pre><code>def choose(items,chances):
    import random
    p = chances[0]
    x = random.random()
    i = 0
    while x &gt; p :
    	i = i + 1
    	p = p + chances[i]
    return items[i]

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><pre><code>lst = [ ('Orange', 0.10), ('Apple', 0.05), ('Mango', 0.15), ('etc', 0.69) ]

x = 0.0
lst2 = []
for fruit, chance in lst:
    low = x
    high = x + chance
    tup = (low, high, fruit)
    lst2.append(tup)
    x += chance

if x &gt; 1.0:
    raise ValueError, "chances add up to more than 100%"

low = x
high = 1.0
tup = (low, high, None)
lst2.append(tup)

def pick_one(lst2):
    if lst2[0][2] is None:

    while True:
        r = random.random()
        for low, high, fruit in lst2:
            if low &lt;= r &lt; high:
                if fruit is None:

pick_one(lst2)


# test it 10,000 times
d = {}
for i in xrange(10000):
    x = pick_one(lst2)
    if x in d:
        d[x] += 1
    else:
        d[x] = 1
</code></pre>

<p>I think this is a little clearer.  Instead of a tricky way of representing ranges as ascending values, we just keep ranges.  Because we are testing ranges, we can simply walk forward through the lst2 values; no need to use <code>reversed()</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>One solution is to normalize the probabilities to integers and then repeat each element once per value (e.g. a list with 2 Oranges, 1 Apple, 3 Mangos).  This is incredibly easy to do (<code>from random import choice</code>).  If that is not practical, try the code <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/498229/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><pre><code>import random
d= {'orange': 0.10, 'mango': 0.15, 'apple': 0.05}
weightedArray = []
for k in d:
  weightedArray+=[k]*int(d[k]*100)
random.choice(weightedArray)
</code></pre>
