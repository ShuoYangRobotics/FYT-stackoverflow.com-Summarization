<h3>Question (ID-4693120):</h3><h2>use of "global" keyword in python</h2><p>What I understand for reading the documentation is that python has a separate namespace for functions, and if I want to use a global variable in that function I need to use "global". </p>

<p>I'm using python 2.7 and I tired this little test</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; sub = ['0', '0', '0', '0']
&gt;&gt;&gt; def getJoin():
...     return '.'.join(sub)
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; getJoin()
'0.0.0.0'
</code></pre>

<p>It seems things are working fine even without global. I was able to access global variable without any problem.</p>

<p>Am I missing anything? Also following is from python documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Names listed in a global statement
  must not be defined as formal
  parameters or in a for loop control
  target, class definition, function
  definition, or import statement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While formal parameters and class definition makes sens to me, I'm not able to understand the restriction on for loop control target and function definition.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The keyword <code>global</code> is only useful to change or create global variables in a local context, although creating global variables is seldom considered a good solution.</p>

<pre><code>def bob():
    me = "locally defined"    # Defined only in local context
    print me

bob()
print me     # Asking for a global variable
</code></pre>

<p>The above will give you:</p>

<pre><code>locally defined
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "file.py", line 9, in &lt;module&gt;
    print me
NameError: name 'me' is not defined
</code></pre>

<p>While if you use the <code>global</code> statement, the variable will become available "outside" the scope of the function, effectively becoming a global variable.</p>

<pre><code>def bob():
    global me
    me = "locally defined"   # Defined locally but declared as global
    print me

bob()
print me     # Asking for a global variable
</code></pre>

<p>So the above code will give you:</p>

<pre><code>locally defined
locally defined
</code></pre>

<p>In addition, due to the nature of python, you could also use <code>global</code> to declare functions, classes or other objects in a local context. Although I would advise against it since it causes nightmares if something goes wrong or needs debugging.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Accessing a name and assigning a name are different. In your case, you are just accessing a name.</p>

<p>If you assign to a variable within a function, that variable is assumed to be local unless you declare it global. In the absence of that, it is assumed to be global.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 1         # global 
&gt;&gt;&gt; def foo():
        print x       # accessing it, it is global

&gt;&gt;&gt; foo()
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; def foo():   
        x = 2        # local x
        print x 

&gt;&gt;&gt; x            # global x
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo()        # prints local x
2
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>While you can access global variables without the <code>global</code> keyword, if you want to assign to them you have to it.</p>

<pre><code>foo = 1
def test():
    foo = 2 # new local foo

def blub():
    global foo
    foo = 3 # changes the value of the global foo
</code></pre>

<p>In your case you're just accessing the list <code>sub</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>This is the difference between accessing the name and <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/executionmodel.html" rel="nofollow">binding</a> it within a scope.</p>

<p>If you're just looking up a variable to read its value, you've got access to global as well as local scope.</p>

<p>However if you assign to a variable who's name isn't in local scope, you are <em>binding</em> that name into this scope (and if that name also exists as a global, you'll hide that). </p>

<p>If you want to be able to assign to the global name, you need to tell the parser to use the global name rather than bind a new local name - which is what the 'global' keyword does.</p>

<p>Binding anywhere within a block causes the name everywhere in that block to become bound, which can cause some rather odd looking consequences (e.g. UnboundLocalError suddenly appearing in previously working code).</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; def p():
    print(a) # accessing global scope, no binding going on
&gt;&gt;&gt; def q():
    a = 3 # binding a name in local scope - hiding global
    print(a)
&gt;&gt;&gt; def r():
    print(a) # fail - a is bound to local scope, but not assigned yet
    a = 4
&gt;&gt;&gt; p()
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; q()
3
&gt;&gt;&gt; r()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;pyshell#35&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    r()
  File "&lt;pyshell#32&gt;", line 2, in r
    print(a) # fail - a is bound to local scope, but not assigned yet
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'a' referenced before assignment
&gt;&gt;&gt;

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Any variable declared outside of a function is assumed to be global, it's only when declaring them from inside of functions (except constructors) that you must specify that the variable be global.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>It means that you should not do the following:</p>

<pre><code>x = 1

def myfunc():
  global x

  # formal parameter
  def localfunction(x):
    return x+1

  # import statement
  import os.path as x

  # for loop control target
  for x in range(10):
    print x

  # class definition
  class x(object):
    def __init__(self):
      pass

  #function definition
  def x():
    print "I'm bad"
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>The other answers answer your question. Another important thing to know about names in Python is that they are either local or global on a per-scope basis.</p>

<p>Consider this, for example:</p>

<pre><code>value = 42

def doit():
    print value
    value = 0

doit()
print value
</code></pre>

<p>You can probably guess that the <code>value = 0</code> statement will be assigning to a local variable and not affect the value of the same variable declared outside the <code>doit()</code> function. You may be more surprised to discover that <em>the code above won't run.</em> The statement <code>print value</code> inside the function produces an <code>UnboundLocalError.</code></p>

<p>The reason is that Python has noticed that, elsewhere in the function, you define the name <code>value</code> and <code>value</code> is not declared <code>global</code>. That makes it a local variable. But when you try to print it, the local name hasn't been defined yet. Python in this case <em>does not fall back</em> to looking for the name as a global variable, as some other languages do. Essentially, you cannot access a global variable if you have defined a local variable of the same name <em>anywhere</em> in the function.</p>

<p>This tripped me up many times, and I hope to avoid you tripping over the same thing.</p>
