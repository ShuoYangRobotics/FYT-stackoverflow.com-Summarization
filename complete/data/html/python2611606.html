<h3>Question (ID-2611606):</h3><h2>Geometry library for python (or C++) for CAD-like operations?</h2><p>I'm trying to put together a simple program that will let me visualize a series of consecutive cuts on a wood panel using a router with a particular cutting head.  I'm trying to find a decent geometry library that will give me a shortcut through the CAD-like stuff.  </p>

<p>Specifically, I'd like to be able to define a rectangular solid (the wood panel) and then define a bit profile shape, and take cuts through the rectangular solid (sometimes on a straight line, sometimes on a circular arc).  Does anyone know of anything that will do this?</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Maybe <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/free-cad/index.php?title=Scripting" rel="nofollow">FreeCAD</a>'s Python level can supply what you're requesting.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Going the C++ way, if you have Direct3D/OpenGL experience, you could muck around with <a href="http://tetgen.berlios.de" rel="nofollow">TetGen</a> and <a href="http://gts.sourceforge.net" rel="nofollow">GTS</a> to put something together.</p>

<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Very Long learning curve.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I have experimenting with <a href="http://carve-csg.com/" rel="nofollow">Carve CSG</a> recently and am happy with the results so far. You could easily subtract the cut from the wood panel to get the results you want.</p>
