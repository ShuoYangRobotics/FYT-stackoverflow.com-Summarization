<h3>Question (ID-5348327):</h3><h2>How to shorten this expression using regex</h2><p>I have the following if statement:</p>

<pre><code>if not fileName.startswith(".") and re.search("(.exe|.EXE)$", fileName) is not None and not fileName.endswith("-xyz.exe"):
    pass
</code></pre>

<p>Essentially, I would like to check that the filename does not start with a period and ends with either .exe or .EXE extension, but not with the -xyz.exe extension.  How can I get rid of the startswith and endswith and combine those two checks into the regex itself.  </p>

<p>UPDATE: I ask because I want to learn more about regex. Depending on the readability, I will determine if that would be worth making it more concise or not.</p>

<p>UPDATE 2: I ran into this situation.  I always look for opportunities to learn more about regex.  This seems like a good opportunity, so I TRIED to do it MYSELF FIRST until I got stuck.  Please do not give non-regex solution or echo Mark Pilgrim's statement about "now you have 2 problems", because anyone could have done that.  Instead, prove it to me that now I have 2 problems, just like Mark Pilgrim continued with his lesson.  Or show me that it's slick. </p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>if re.search(
    r"""# Always use VERBOSE when composing non-trivial regex!
    ^                 # Anchor to start of string.
    # Apply multiple lookahead assertions from string start:
    (?!\.)            # Assert does NOT begin with dot.
    (?=.*\.exe$)      # Assert DOES end with .EXE
    (?!.*-xyz\.exe$)  # Assert does NOT end with -XYZ.EXE
    .*                # Ok to match the filename (optional).
    """, 
    subject, re.IGNORECASE | re.VERBOSE):
    # Successful match
else:
    # Match attempt failed
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> After reading your question a bit closer, it appears you are concerned with the case of the EXE. In that case the regex can easily handle that, too:</p>



<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>if re.search(
    r"""# Always use VERBOSE when composing non-trivial regex!
    ^                     # Anchor to start of string.
    # Apply multiple lookahead assertions from string start:
    (?!\.)                # Assert does not begin with dot.
    (?=.*\.(?:exe|EXE)$)  # Assert DOES end with .EXE or .exe
    (?!.*-xyz\.exe$)      # Assert does NOT end with -xyz-exe
    .*                    # Ok to match the filename (optional).
    """, 
    subject, re.VERBOSE):
    # Successful match
else:
    # Match attempt failed
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit2:</strong>  John Machin has pointed out that with Python, when you are looking for a match that can only occur at the start of a target string, then using the <code>^</code> start of string assertion with the <code>re.search</code> method is much slower than using <code>re.match</code> (and is considered bad practice). With that in mind, here is an improved version:</p>



<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>if re.match(
    r"""# Always use VERBOSE when composing non-trivial regex!
    # Apply multiple lookahead assertions from string start:
    (?!\.)                # Assert does not begin with dot.
    (?=.*\.(?:exe|EXE)$)  # Assert DOES end with .EXE or .exe
    (?!.*-xyz\.exe$)      # Assert does NOT end with -xyz-exe
    .*                    # Ok to match the filename (optional).
    """, 
    subject, re.VERBOSE):
    # Successful match
else:
    # Match attempt failed
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I wouldn't use a regexp, just wrap that onto multiple lines and make it a little smarter:</p>

<pre><code>if not filename.startswith(".") \
   and filename.lower().endswith(".exe") \
   and not filename.endswith("-xyz.exe"):
    #do stuff
</code></pre>

<p>Do note that this is slightly different in that <code>*.eXe</code>, <code>*.eXE</code> and other mixed case versions of the extension would then be ignored as well, unlike in the original.  But I'm betting that it doesn't <em>really</em> matter and that my test is better.</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong>: fixed the <code>".exe"</code> part because I had the condition flipped, but if you're trying to learn regular expressions this is a weird contrived example and I think it's best not to try and shoehorn regular expressions as a solution to a problem where it's not a good solution</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You need to use a negative lookbehind assertion:</p>

<pre><code>import re

regex = '[^.].*(?:(?&lt;!-xyz).exe|.EXE)'

vectors = (
  '.123.dat',
  '.123.exe',
  '.123.EXE',
  '123.dat',
  '123.exe',
  '123.EXE',
  '.123-xyz.dat',
  '.123-xyz.exe',
  '.123-xyz.EXE',
  '123-xyz.dat',
  '123-xyz.exe',
  '123-xyz.EXE',
)

for v in vectors:
  print "%s: " % (v,),
  if (bool(re.match(regex, v)) == (not v.startswith(".") and
      re.search("(.exe|.EXE)$", v) is not None and
      not v.endswith("-xyz.exe"))):
    print 'PASS'
  else:
    print 'FAIL'
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Learn to use elementary regular expressions before you start trying to "shorten" your code.</p>

<p>This piece <code>re.search("(.exe|.EXE)$", fileName)</code> has THREE deficiencies:</p>

<p>(1) Should use raw strings by habit, even when it makes no difference, because then you (and your readers) don't need to spend time nutting out whether it matters or not.</p>

<p>(2) Unescaped <code>.</code> matches ANY character (except a newline (in the default case)).</p>

<p>(3) <code>$</code> matches before a newline at the end of a string; you should use <code>\Z</code> instead. If you don't, <code>foo.exe\n</code> (easy enough to get by mistake if your input was supplied by someone who didn't strip the <code>\n</code>) will match.</p>

<p>What you need is <code>re.search(r"(\.exe|\.EXE)\Z", fileName)</code></p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> for the benefit of anyone who thinks that <code>re.search("^blahblah", ...)</code> is a good idea:</p>

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><pre><code>import re

pat = re.compile('(?!\.)'
                 '.+'
                 '\.'
                 '(?:(?&lt;!-xyz\.)exe|EXE)'

         '123-xyz.dat', '123-xyz.exe', '123-xyz.EXE', )

print '\n'.join(v.ljust(18)+str(bool(pat.match(v))) for v in names)
</code></pre>

<p>.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>You are right, ridgerunner, <code>[^.]</code> is better than <code>(?!\.)</code> : it's more readable, more logic and slightly faster, -4 % (I tested)</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>I also compared <code>'(?!\.).+?\.(?:EXE|(?&lt;!-xyz)exe)\Z'</code> ( there is <code>.+?</code> instead of <code>.+</code>)</p>

<p>With this RE, execution is longer. 
The additional time depends of the number of dots in the tested names.</p>

<p>On names like <strong>'78999.abc.juty.123.dat'</strong> it is around 15 % longer, and on names like <strong>'123.dat'</strong> it's  3 % longer.
I think the reason is that the regex motor examine after each reading of a character if the read character is a dot or not.</p>

<p>On the contrary, with <code>'.+\.'</code> the regex motor goes until the end, and then come back to search the last dot. I think it is a correct explanation because, if the RE <code>'(?!\.).+?\.(?:EXE|(?&lt;!-xyz)exe)\Z'</code>  is tested on names like <strong>'123.teybertyhbeythbeytberyetynetynetnyetnydat'</strong> , the time is again longer (+ 30 %)</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>I realized that my RE is very similar to the Ignacio's one, and I wondered why I wrote this RE as it seems to have no particular interest. In fact, at the beginning, my idea was to write <code>'(?!\.).+?(?&lt;=.EXE|(?&lt;!-xyz).exe)\Z'</code> and then I wrote another string. By the way, with this abandonned RE , the execution time is 25 % longer on short names and 74 % longer on long names.</p>

<p>Finally, when I tested the execution times, <strong>Ignacio's solution is 25 % longer on short names ( '123.dat' ) and 47 % longer on long names ( '78999.abc.juty.123.dat' )</strong></p>

<p>Best regex is then</p>

<pre><code>pat = re.compile('[^.]'
                 '.+'
                 '\.'
                 '(?:(?&lt;!-xyz\.)exe|EXE)'
                 '\Z') 
</code></pre>

<p>I let <code>'.+'</code> , not replaced by <code>'.*'</code> , because there must be at least 4 characters in the name if we want the name to end with <code>'.exe'</code> or <code>'.EXE'</code></p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>That will involve accessing every file that doesn't start with '.' or ends with '-xyz.exe'. The regex module cannot parse stuff outside its namespace. I don't think it's possible, but have you tried checking the module's doc?</p>
