<h3>Question (ID-4617251):</h3><h2>Learning Python</h2><p>I am going to need to learn advanced Python and must be good at it in about a year, Are there any books, recommendations. I am already very familiar with PHP, MySQL, JS + HTML, and know a bit of java and C (arduino programming).</p>

<p>Thanks,

<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Since you sound like a competent programmer, the best place to start may be the official <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/index.html" rel="nofollow">Python 2.7 Tutorial</a>. It's very thorough, certainly.</p>

<p>After that, I advise looking up through the <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/index.html" rel="nofollow">language reference</a> and <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/index.html" rel="nofollow">standard library reference</a> (the stdlib for Python is pretty massive) to get everything else.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>There are a lot of good resources, either at <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/" rel="nofollow">the python wiki</a>, or here at previous similar questions.</p>

<p>Generally I would recommend starting with the <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/" rel="nofollow">official python tutorial</a>. Alternatively, you might want to check <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers" rel="nofollow">other tutorials</a>, aimed for people with previous programming experience.</p>

<p>Afterwards, you can try books, such as '<a href="http://diveintopython.net/" rel="nofollow">Dive Into Python</a>', but I always preferred sharpening my skills by trying a set of problems, such as <a href="http://www.pythonchallenge.com/" rel="nofollow">python challenge</a> and <a href="http://projecteuler.net/" rel="nofollow">Project Euler</a>. </p>

<p>I think that trying to solve such problems is a good advice for every programmer who's trying to learn a new language.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>take a look at Mark Lutz's book..</p>

<p>it's more than an introduction, but it's not very thorough</p>

<p><a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9781565924642" rel="nofollow">http://oreilly.com/catalog/9781565924642</a></p>

<p>once you finished that one, if you found it useful you might want to pass at:</p>

<p><a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596158118?green=18666053383&amp;cmp=af-mybuy-9780596158118.IP" rel="nofollow">http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596158118?green=18666053383&amp;cmp=af-mybuy-9780596158118.IP</a></p>

<p>another interesting one is the Python Cookbook</p>

<p><a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596001674" rel="nofollow">http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596001674</a> (careful, it's 6 years old)</p>

<p>the official tutorials are very useful, too ;)</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>It's not a book, but I found the <a href="http://code.google.com/edu/languages/google-python-class/index.html" rel="nofollow">Google Python Class</a> very useful. There's video, reading material, and practice questions that I found very useful. </p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I have good books, but I don't know exactly what do you want (CGI's, XML manipulation, ..).
A nice way to start your study is with this book: Apress Beginning Python From Novice to Professional.
After you see the examples and the simple structures, I suggest you to look the oficial site: <a href="http://www.python.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.python.org/</a> and the HOWTO examples: <a href="http://docs.python.org/dev/howto/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/dev/howto/index.html</a></p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>It looks like there are a lot of good books being recommended. Be aware that there are two main versions of Python in circulation. 3.0 is the new, and a lot of 2.7 programs won't work with 3.0. Some of the syntax has been tidied up - and one of the most common problems is "print" which now has a syntax more consistent with the rest of the language.</p>

<p>As with any language, the best way to learn it is to start using it. Choose a project which pulls to Python's strengths (eg. text processing and data structures) and your probable needs in 12 months time, and start coding!</p>
