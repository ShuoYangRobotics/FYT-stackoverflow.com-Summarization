<h3>Question (ID-649029):</h3><h2>Where can I find good python Twisted framework documentation, blog entries, articles, etc?</h2><p>I'm playing around with <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com" rel="nofollow">Twisted</a> and documentation found on their homepage doesn't answer all my questions.</p>

<p>The topic I am most interested at the moment is Twisted Application Framework. Also some open source servers using twisted framework would provide nice material for studying how it's all tied up together in a bigger project.</p>

<p>So far I've checked out iCal and read documentation on twisted website (3x) and few good articles I found in google.</p>

<p>I recommend starting with the "deferred" docs online, and making absolutely sure you understand what asynchronous means and what deferreds are for.  The best online docs that I've found are on the official site, though they could surely use some polishing:</p>

<p>The developers recommend reading the source as well, though if you have specific questions, I've found that the devs hang out and respond on both the IRC channel (<strong>#twisted</strong> on the freenode network) and the online mailing lists (There's <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python" rel="nofollow">a general</a> and a <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-web" rel="nofollow">twisted-web specific</a> list)</p>

<p>As for blogs, there's at least the two below (both blogs are by twisted developers).  I bet if you asked this same question on the twisted-python mailing list, you'd get a much better and more comprehensive answer than I could possibly give.  :-)</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I think you need to get your concepts right to start with.  I found this blog post to be helpful.</p>

<p><a href="http://krondo.com/blog/?p=1209" rel="nofollow">Introduction to Asynchronous Programming and Twisted</a></p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><a href="http://divmod.org/" rel="nofollow">Divmod</a> has some medium sized projects which use Twisted and might make good additions to your reading list.  Additionally, the <a href="http://launchpad.net/tx" rel="nofollow">Twisted Community Code in Launchpad</a> will give you a much longer list of Twisted-based projects to look at.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I found the <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596100322/" rel="nofollow">Twisted Network Programming Essentials</a> book to be a useful guide when first learning Twisted.  Although it is more of a Twisted "cookbook".  Some of its "recipes" are useful.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>There's an overview here: <a href="http://www.python.org/workshops/2002-02/papers/09/index.htm" rel="nofollow">The Twisted Network Framework</a>.</p>

<p>Bruce Eckel wrote a nice article that points out some of the weird names Twisted uses: <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=156396" rel="nofollow">Grokking Twisted</a>. According to that article, there are some good examples in <em>The Python Cookbook</em>, 2nd Ed (O'Reilly).  </p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Both very good references</p>

<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Twisted is really pretty simple -- not much to it.  Just start writing an app and show it to someone experienced and let them help you fix it up.  You could also help document it as you learn stuff.  You'll understand it quite a bit more that way.  :)</p>
