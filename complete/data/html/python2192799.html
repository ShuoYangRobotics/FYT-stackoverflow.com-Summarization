<h3>Question (ID-2192799):</h3><h2>Html to image in javascript or python</h2><p>Just a dumb question...
Is there any way you can create an image, say png, with the content of an html page, with a simple click of a button?</p>

<p>Thanks to anyone who cares to answers.</p>

<p>It requires webkit, xvfb (or X) and Qt4, and works best on Ubuntu.</p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Thanks for you answers. But what I wanted was some code in javascript or python that would allow me to create an image from a table or div. </p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>If you're not locked to having it as a PNG, you could turn it into a PDF with Pisa/Report Lab (http://www.xhtml2pdf.com/). It handles tables pretty well.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>There is a service called Webthumb at <a href="http://webthumb.bluga.net/home" rel="nofollow">http://webthumb.bluga.net/home</a> that I have used for something similar.</p>

<p>It has a fairly easy REST interface for you to work upon.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>There is a service with the name sitethumbshot.com. Its pretty good service and easy to integrate.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>You can take a look at CutyCapt as well - <a href="http://cutycapt.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">http://cutycapt.sourceforge.net/</a></p>
