<h3>Question (ID-5888213):</h3><h2>Python regex matching in conditionals</h2><p>I am parsing file and I want to check each line against a few complicated regexs.  Something like this</p>

<pre><code>if re.match(regex1, line): do stuff
elif re.match(regex2, line): do other stuff
elif re.match(regex3, line): do still more stuff
...
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, to do the stuff, I need the match objects.  I can only think of three possibilities, each of which leaves something to be desired.</p>

<pre><code>if re.match(regex1, line): 
    m = re.match(regex1, line)
    do stuff
elif re.match(regex2, line):
    m = re.match(regex2, line)
    do other stuff
...
</code></pre>

<p>which requires doing the complicated matching twice (these are long files and long regex :/) </p>

<pre><code>m = re.match(regex1, line)
if m: do stuff
else:
    m = re.match(regex2, line)
    if m: do other stuff
    else:
       ...
</code></pre>

<p>which gets terrible as I indent further and further.</p>

<pre><code>while True:
    m = re.match(regex1, line)
    if m:
        do stuff
        break
    m = re.match(regex2, line)
    if m:
        do other stuff
        break
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>which just looks weird.</p>

<p>What's the right way to do this?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You could define a function for the action required by each regex and do something like</p>

<pre><code>def dostuff():
    stuff

def dootherstuff():
    otherstuff

def doevenmorestuff():
    evenmorestuff

actions = ((regex1, dostuff), (regex2, dootherstuff), (regex3, doevenmorestuff))

for regex, action in actions:
    m = re.match(regex, line)
    if m: 
        action()
        break
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I would break your regex up into smaller components and search for simple first with longer matches later. </p>

<p>something like:</p>

<pre><code>if re.match(simplepart,line):
      if re.match(complexregex, line):
          do stuff
elif re.match(othersimple, line):
      if re.match(complexother, line):
          do other stuff
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><pre><code>for patt in (regex1, regex2, regex3):
    match = patt.match(line)
    if match:
        if patt == regex1:
            # some handling
        elif patt == regex2:
            # more
        elif patt == regex3:
            # more
        break
</code></pre>

<p>I like Tim's answer because it separates out the per-regex matching code to keep things simple. For my answer, I wouldn't put more than a line or two of code for each match, and if you need more, call a separate method.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Why not use a dictionnary/switch statement ?</p>

<pre><code>def action1(stuff):
    do the stuff 1
def action2(stuff):
    do the stuff 2

regex_action_dict = {regex1 : action1, regex2 : action2}
for regex, action in regex_action_dict.iteritems():
    match_object = re.match(regex, line):
    if match_object:
        action(match_object, line)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>First off, do you really need to use regexps for your matching?  Where I would use regexps in, e.g., perl, I'll often use string functions in python (find, startswith, etc).</p>

<p>If you really need to use regexps, you can make a simple search function that does the search, and if the match is returned, sets a store object to keep your match around before returning True.</p>

<p>e.g.,</p>

<pre><code>def search(pattern, s, store):
    match = re.search(pattern, s)
    store.match = match
    return match is not None

class MatchStore(object):
    pass   # irrelevant, any object with a 'match' attr would do

where = MatchStore()
if search(pattern1, s, where):
    pattern1 matched, matchobj in where.match
elif search(pattern2, s, where):
    pattern2 matched, matchobj in where.match
...
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>FWIW, I've stressed over the same thing, and I usually settle for the 2nd form (nested <code>else</code>s) or some variation. I don't think you'll find anything much better in general, if you're looking to optimize readability (many of these answers seem significantly less readable than your candidates to me).</p>

<p>Sometimes if you're in an outer loop or a short function, you can use a variation of your 3rd form (the one with <code>break</code> statements) where you either <code>continue</code> or <code>return</code>, and that's readable enough, but I definitely wouldn't create a <code>while True</code> block just to avoid the "ugliness" of the other candidates.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>My solution with an exemple; there is only one <code>re.search()</code> that is performed:</p>

<pre><code>text = '''\
koala + image @ wolf - snow
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
An uninteresting line
There were 152 ravens on a branch
sea mountain sun ocean ice hot desert river'''

import re
regx3 = re.compile('hot[ \t]+([^ ]+)')
regx2 = re.compile('(\d+|ev.+?ng)')
regx1 = re.compile('([%~#`\@+=\d]+)')
regx  = re.compile('|'.join((regx3.pattern,regx2.pattern,regx1.pattern)))

def one_func(line):
    print 'I am one_func on : '+line

def other_func(line):
    print 'I am other_func on : '+line

def another_func(line):
    print 'I am another_func on : '+line

tupl_funcs = (one_func, other_func, another_func) 


for line in text.splitlines():
    print line
    m = regx.search(line)
    if m:
        print 'm.groups() : ',m.groups()
        group_number = (i for i,m in enumerate(m.groups()) if m).next()
        print "group_number : ",group_number
        tupl_funcs[group_number](line)
    else:
        print 'No match'
        print 'No treatment'
    print
</code></pre>

<p>result</p>

<pre><code>koala + image @ wolf - snow
m.groups() :  (None, None, '+')
group_number :  2
I am another_func on : koala + image @ wolf - snow

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
m.groups() :  (None, 'evening', None)
group_number :  1
I am other_func on : Good evening, ladies and gentlemen

An uninteresting line
No match
No treatment

There were 152 ravens on a branch
m.groups() :  (None, '152', None)
group_number :  1
I am other_func on : There were 152 ravens on a branch

sea mountain sun ocean ice hot desert river
m.groups() :  ('desert', None, None)
group_number :  0
I am one_func on : sea mountain sun ocean ice hot desert river

<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>In this particular case there appears to be no convenient way to do this in python.
if python would accept the syntax: </p>

<pre><code>if (m = re.match(pattern,string)):
    text = m.group(1)
</code></pre>

<p>then all would be fine, but apparently you
cannot do that</p>
