<h3>Question (ID-6633678):</h3><h2>Finding words after keyword in python</h2><p>Hi i am very new to python and very new to regex, so i would appreciate your patience and understanding. So here is my issue:</p>

<p>I want to find words that appear after a keyword(specified and searched by me) and print out the result. I know that i am suppose to use regex to do it, and i tried it out too, like this:</p>

<pre><code>import re
s = "hi my name is ryan, and i am new to python and would like to learn more"
m = re.search("^name: (\w+)", s)
print m.groups()
</code></pre>

<p>The output is just:</p>

<pre><code>"is"
</code></pre>

<p>But i want to get all the words and punctuations that comes after the word "name".
could someone help me out with this?</p>

<p>Any help would be largely appreciated. Thanks you very much.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Instead of using regexes you could just (for example) separate your string <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html">with <code>str.partition(separator)</code></a> like this:</p>

<pre><code>mystring =  "hi my name is ryan, and i am new to python and would like to learn more"
keyword = 'name'
befor_keyowrd, keyword, after_keyword = mystring.partition('keyword')
# before_keyword = 'hi my '
# keyword = name
# after_keyword = ' is ryan, and i am new to python and would like to learn more'
</code></pre>

<p>You have to deal with the needless whitespaces separately, though.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Instead of <code>"^name: (\w+)"</code> use:</p>

<pre><code>"^name:(.*)"
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You could simply do</p>

<p>s = "hi my name is ryan, and i am new to python and would like to learn more"</p>

<p>s.split('name')</p>

<p>This will split your string and return a list like this ['hi my', 'is ryan, and i am new to python and would like to learn more']</p>

<p>depending on what you want to do this may help or not.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Your example will not work, but as I understand the idea:</p>

<pre><code>regexp = re.compile("name(.*)$")
print regexp.search(s).group(1)
# prints " is ryan, and i am new to python and would like to learn more"
</code></pre>

<p>This will print all after "name" and till end of the line.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>What you have used regarding your output:</p>

<pre><code>re.search("name (\w+)", s)
</code></pre>

<p>What you have to use (<em>match all</em>):</p>

<pre><code>re.search("name (.*)", s)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>An other alternative...</p>

<pre><code>   import re
   m = re.search('(?&lt;=name)(.*)', s)
   print m.groups()
</code></pre>
