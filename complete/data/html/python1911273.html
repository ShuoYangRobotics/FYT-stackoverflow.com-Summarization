<h3>Question (ID-1911273):</h3><h2>Is there a better way to compare dictionary values</h2><p>I am currently using the following function to compare dictionary values. Is there a faster or better way to do it?</p>

<pre><code>match = True
for keys in dict1:
    if dict1[keys] != dict2[keys]:
        match = False
        print keys
        print dict1[keys],
        print  '-&gt;' ,
        print dict2[keys]
</code></pre>

<p>Edit: Both the dicts contain the same keys.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>If the dicts have identical sets of keys and you need all those prints for any value difference, there isn't much you can do; maybe something like:</p>

<pre><code>diffkeys = [k for k in dict1 if dict1[k] != dict2[k]]
for k in diffkeys:
  print k, ':', dict1[k], '-&gt;', dict2[k]
</code></pre>

<p>pretty much equivalent to what you have, but you might get nicer presentation for example by sorting diffkeys before you loop on it.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Uhm, you are describing <code>dict1 == dict2</code> ( check if boths dicts are equal )</p>

<p>But what your code does is <code>all( dict1[k]==dict2[k] for k in dict1 )</code> ( check if all entries in dict1 are equal to those in dict2 )</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You can use sets for this too</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = {'x': 1, 'y': 2}
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = {'y': 2, 'x': 1}
&gt;&gt;&gt; set(a.iteritems())-set(b.iteritems())
set([])
&gt;&gt;&gt; a['y']=3
&gt;&gt;&gt; set(a.iteritems())-set(b.iteritems())
set([('y', 3)])
&gt;&gt;&gt; set(b.iteritems())-set(a.iteritems())
set([('y', 2)])
&gt;&gt;&gt; set(b.iteritems())^set(a.iteritems())
set([('y', 3), ('y', 2)])
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>If you're just comparing for equality, you can just do this:</p>

<pre><code>if not dict1 == dict2:
    match = False
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise, the only major problem I see is that you're going to get a KeyError if there is a key in dict1 that is not in dict2, so you may want to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>for key in dict1:
    if not key in dict2 or dict1[key] != dict2[key]:
        match = False
</code></pre>

<p>You could compress this into a comprehension to just get the list of keys that don't match too:</p>

<pre><code>mismatch_keys = [key for key in x if not key in y or x[key] != y[key]]
match = not bool(mismatch_keys) #If the list is not empty, they don't match 
for key in mismatch_keys:
    print key
    print '%s -&gt; %s' % (dict1[key],dict2[key])
</code></pre>

<p>The only other optimization I can think of might be to use "len(dict)" to figure out which dict has fewer entries and loop through that one first to have the shortest loop possible.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = {'x': 1, 'y': 2}
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = {'y': 2, 'x': 1}
&gt;&gt;&gt; print a == b
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; c = {'z': 1}
&gt;&gt;&gt; print a == c
False
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>If the true intent of the question is the comparison between dicts (rather than printing differences), the answer is</p>

<pre><code>dict1 == dict2
</code></pre>

<p>This has been mentioned before, but I felt it was slightly drowning in other bits of information. It might appear superficial, but the value comparison of dicts has actually powerful semantics. It covers</p>

<ul>
<li>number of keys (if they don't match, the dicts are not equal)</li>
<li>names of keys (if they don't match, they're not equal)</li>
<li>value of each key (they have to be '==', too)</li>
</ul>

<p>The last point again appears trivial, but is acutally interesting as it means that all of this <strong>applies recursively</strong> to nested dicts as well. E.g.</p>

<pre><code> m1 = {'f':True}
 m2 = {'f':True}
 m3 = {'a':1, 2:2, 3:m1}
 m4 = {'a':1, 2:2, 3:m2}
 m3 == m4  # True
</code></pre>

<p>Similar semantics exist for the comparison of lists. All of this makes it a no-brainer to e.g. compare deep Json structures, alone with a simple "==".</p>
