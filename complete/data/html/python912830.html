<h3>Question (ID-912830):</h3><h2>Using subprocess to run Python script on Windows</h2><p>Is there a simple way to run a Python script on Windows/Linux/OS X?</p>

<p>On the latter two, <code>subprocess.Popen("/the/script.py")</code> works, but on Windows I get the following error:</p>

<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test_functional.py", line 91, in test_functional
    log = tvnamerifiy(tmp)
  File "test_functional.py", line 49, in tvnamerifiy
    stdout = PIPE
  File "C:\Python26\lib\subprocess.py", line 595, in __init__

  <p><em><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/24718/monkut">monkut's</a> comment</em>: The use case isn't clear. Why use subprocess to run a python script? Is there something preventing you from importing the script and calling the necessary function?</p>

<p>I was writing a quick script to test the overall functionality of a Python-command-line tool (to test it on various platforms). Basically it had to create a bunch of files in a temp folder, run the script on this and check the files were renamed correctly.</p>

<p>I could have imported the script and called the function, but since it relies on <code>sys.argv</code> and uses <code>sys.exit()</code>, I would have needed to do something like..</p>

<pre><code>import sys
import tvnamer
sys.argv.append("-b", "/the/folder")
try:
    tvnamer.main()
except BaseException, errormsg:
    print type(errormsg)
</code></pre>

<p>Also, I wanted to capture the stdout and stderr for debugging incase something went wrong.</p>

<p>Of course a better way would be to write the script in more unit-testable way, but the script is basically "done" and I'm doing a final batch of testing before doing a "1.0" release (after which I'm going to do a rewrite/restructure, which will be far tidier and more testable)</p>

<p>Basically, it was much easier to simply run the script as a process, after finding the <code>sys.executable</code> variable. I would have written it as a shell-script, but that wouldn't have been cross-platform. The final script can be found <a href="http://github.com/dbr/tvdb%5Fapi/blob/c8d7b356cd1a7bb2ab22b510ea74e03a7d27fad6/tests/test%5Ffunctional.py">here</a></p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Just found <code>sys.executable</code> - the full path to the current Python executable, which can be used to run the script (instead of relying on the shbang, which obviously doesn't work on Windows)</p>

<pre><code>import sys
import subprocess

theproc = subprocess.Popen([sys.executable, "myscript.py"])
theproc.communicate()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>When you are running a python script on windows in subprocess you should use python in front of the script name.  Try:</p>

<pre><code>process = subprocess.Popen("python /the/script.py")
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>How about this:</p>

<pre><code>import sys
import subprocess

theproc = subprocess.Popen("myscript.py", shell = True)
theproc.communicate()                   # ^^^^^^^^^^^^
</code></pre>

<p>This tells <code>subprocess</code> to use the OS shell to open your script, and works on anything that you can just run in cmd.exe.</p>

<p>Additionally, this will search the PATH for "myscript.py" - which could be desirable.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>It looks like windows tries to run the script using its own EXE framework rather than call it like </p>

<pre><code>python /the/script.py
</code></pre>

<p>Try,</p>

<pre><code>subprocess.Popen(["python", "/the/script.py"])
</code></pre>

<p>Edit: "python" would need to be on your path.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You are using a pathname separator which is platform dependent. Windows uses "\" and Unix uses "/".</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Yes <code>subprocess.Popen(cmd, ..., shell=True)</code> works like a charm.  On Windows the <code>.py</code> file extension is recognized, so Python is invoked to process it (on *NIX just the usual shebang).  The path environment controls whether things are seen.  So the first arg to <code>Popen</code> is <em>just the name of the script</em>.</p>

<pre><code>subprocess.Popen(['myscript.py', 'arg1', ...], ..., shell=True)
</code></pre>
