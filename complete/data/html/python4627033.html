<h3>Question (ID-4627033):</h3><h2>Printing a string with a little delay between the chars</h2><p>I want a text to be displayed as if it is just being typed. So I need a little delay after every letter.</p>

<p>I tried to do it this way:</p>

<pre><code>import time

text = "Hello, this is a test text to see if all works fine."
for char in text:
   print char,time.sleep(0.2),
</code></pre>

<p>It works fine, except for one problem. I get a "None" after every character.</p>

<p>This is the output:</p>

<p>H None e None l None l None o None , None   None t None h None i None s None   None i None s None   None a None   None t None e None s None t None   None t None e None x None t None   None t None o None   None s None e None e None   None i None f None   None a None l None l None   None w None o None r None k None s None   None f None i None n None e None . None</p>

<p>I don't know why this happens. I hope anyone can help me.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You are printing the result of <code>time.sleep(0.2)</code>, which is <code>None</code>.  Move it to the next line.</p>

<pre><code>text = "Hello, this is a test text to see if all works fine."
for char in text:
    print char,
    time.sleep(0.2)
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, you still have the problem of a space between each character, which can be solved by replacing the <code>print</code> statement with a call to <code>sys.stdout.write</code>.</p>

<pre><code>text = "Hello, this is a test text to see if all works fine."
for char in text:
    sys.stdout.write(char)
    time.sleep(0.2)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Put the <code>time.sleep</code> in a separate line. With a comma, you are printing its return value as well.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You're printing the return value of time.sleep(0.2) which is None.  Put it on a separate line.  The comma after "print char" will prevent a newline from being printed but it will introduce a single space after each character.  </p>

<p>Try this instead:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import sys
&gt;&gt;&gt; import time
&gt;&gt;&gt; text = "Hello, this is a test text to see if all works fine."
&gt;&gt;&gt; for char in text:
...     sys.stdout.write(char)
...     time.sleep(0.2)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Your example prints them all on separate lines I think (at least on windows). You can use printing to <code>sys.stdout</code> to get around this.</p>

<pre><code>import time, sys
for character in text:
    sys.stdout.write(character)
    time.sleep(0.2)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>this line:</p>

<pre><code>print char, time.sleep(0.2)
</code></pre>

<p>decodes as "print the value of <code>char</code>, and then print the return value of the function <code>time.sleep()</code> (which is <code>None</code>)".</p>

<p>You can break them onto separate lines, but the default behavior of <code>print</code> followed by a comma will leave you with spaces between the characters that you probably don't want. If not, look up how to change the behavior of <code>print</code>, or do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import sys
&gt;&gt;&gt; import time
&gt;&gt;&gt; for char in "test string\n":
...    sys.stdout.write(char)
...    time.sleep(0.2)
...
test string
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Thank you all for your help, this is my final code, I made a random timing for the delay as mentioned by Wooble:</p>

<pre><code>import time
import sys
from random import randrange

text = "This is the introduction text."

for c in text:
    sys.stdout.write(c)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    seconds = "0." + str(randrange(1, 4, 1))
    seconds = float(seconds)
    time.sleep(seconds)
</code></pre>
