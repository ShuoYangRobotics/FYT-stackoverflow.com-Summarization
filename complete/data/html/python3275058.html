<h3>Question (ID-3275058):</h3><h2>Reason for "all" and "any" result on empty lists</h2><p>In Python, the built-in functions <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#all" rel="nofollow"><code>all</code></a> and <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#any" rel="nofollow"><code>any</code></a> return <code>True</code> and <code>False</code> respectively for empty iterables. I realise that if it were the other way around, this question could still be asked. But I'd like to know why <em>that specific</em> behaviour was chosen. Was it arbitrary, ie. could it just as easily have been the other way, or is there an underlying reason?</p>

<p>(The reason I ask is simply because I never remember which is which, and if I knew the rationale behind it then I might. Also, curiosity.)</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>How about some analogies...</p>

<p>You have a sock drawer, but it is currently empty. Does it contain any black sock? No - you don't have any socks at all so you certainly don't have a black one. Clearly <code>any([])</code> must return false - if it returned true this would be counter-intuitive.</p>

<p>The case for <code>all([])</code> is slightly more difficult. See the Wikipedia article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuous_truth" rel="nofollow">vacuous truth</a>. Another analogy: If there are no people in a room then everyone in that room can speak French.</p>

<p>Mathematically <code>all([])</code> can be written:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/b/6/eb6ff3d273962bfadb292ad2a3c9fbd8.png"> where the set A is empty.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is considerable debate about whether vacuous statements should be considered true or not, but from a logical viewpoint it makes the most sense:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The main argument that all vacuously true statements are true is as follows: As explained in the article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conditional" rel="nofollow">logical conditionals</a>, the axioms of propositional logic entail that if P is false, then P => Q is true. That is, if we accept those axioms, we must accept that vacuously true statements are indeed true.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also from the article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There seems to be no direct reason to pick true; it’s just that things blow up in our face if we don’t.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Defining a "vacuously true" statement to return false in Python would violate the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment" rel="nofollow">principle of least astonishment</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>One property of <code>any</code> is its recursive definition</p>

<pre><code>any([x,y,z,...]) == (x or any([y,z,...]))
</code></pre>

<p>That means</p>

<pre><code>x == any([x]) == (x or any([]))
</code></pre>

<p>The equality is correct for any <code>x</code> if and only if <code>any([])</code> is defined to be False. Similar for <code>all</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I think of them as being implemented this way</p>

<pre><code>def all(seq):
    for item in seq:
        if not item:
            return False
    return True

def any(seq):
    for item in seq:
        if item:
            return True
    return False
</code></pre>

<p>not sure they <em>are</em> implemented that way though</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Perl 6 also takes the position that <code>all()</code> and <code>any()</code> on empty lists should serve as sane base-cases for their respective reduction operators, and therefore <code>all()</code> is true and <code>any()</code> is false.</p>

<p>That is to say, <code>all(a, b, c)</code> is equivalent to <code>[&amp;] a, b, c</code>, which is equivalent to <code>a &amp; b &amp; c</code> (reduction on the "junctive and" operator, but you can ignore junctions and consider it a logical and for this post), and <code>any(a, b, c)</code> is equivalent to <code>[|] a, b, c</code>, which is equivalent to <code>a | b | c</code> (reduction on the "junctive or" operator -- again, you can pretend it's the same as logical or without missing anything).</p>

<p>Any operator which can have reduction applied to it needs to have a defined behavior when reducing 0 terms, and usually this is done by having a natural identity element -- for instance, <code>[+]()</code> (reduction of addition across zero terms) is 0 because 0 is the additive identity; adding zero to any expression leaves it unchanged. <code>[*]()</code> is likewise 1 because 1 is the multiplicative identity. We've already said that <code>all</code> is equivalent to <code>[&amp;]</code> and <code>any</code> is equivalent to <code>[|]</code> -- well, truth is the <em>and</em>-identity, and falsity is the <em>or</em>-identity -- <em>x and True</em> is x, and <em>x or False</em> is x. This makes it inevitable that <code>all()</code> should be true and <code>any()</code> should be false.</p>

<p>To put it in an entirely different (but practical) perspective, <code>any</code> is a latch that starts off false and becomes true whenever it sees something true; <code>all</code> is a latch that starts off true and becomes false whenever it sees something false. Giving them no arguments means giving them no chance to change state, so you're simply asking them what their "default" state is. :)</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>For general interest, here's the <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=98196" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> in which GvR proposes any/all with a sample implementation like gnibbler's and references quanifiers in ABC.  </p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p><code>any</code> and <code>all</code> have the same meaning in python as everywhere else:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>any</code> is true if at least one is true</li>
<li><code>all</code> is not true if at least one is not true</li>
</ul>
