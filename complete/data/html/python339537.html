<h3>Question (ID-339537):</h3><h2>End-line characters from lines read from text file, using Python</h2><p>When reading lines from a text file using python, the end-line character often needs to be truncated before processing the text, as in the following example:</p>

<pre><code>    f = open("myFile.txt", "r")
    for line in f:
        line = line[:-1]
        # do something with line
</code></pre>

<p>Is there an elegant way or idiom for retrieving text lines without the end-line character?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The <em>idiomatic</em> way to do this in Python is to use <strong>rstrip('\n')</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>for line in open('myfile.txt'):  # opened in text-mode; all EOLs are converted to '\n'
    line = line.rstrip('\n')
    process(line)
</code></pre>

<p>Each of the other alternatives has a gotcha:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>file('...').read().splitlines()</strong> has to load the whole file in memory at once.</li>
<li><strong>line = line[:-1]</strong> will fail if the last line has no EOL.</li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Simple. Use <strong>splitlines()</strong></p>

<pre><code>L = open("myFile.txt", "r").read().splitlines();
for line in L: 
    process(line) # this 'line' will not have '\n' character at the end
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>What's wrong with your code?  I find it to be quite elegant and simple.  The only problem is that if the file doesn't end in a newline, the last line returned won't have a <code>'\n'</code> as the last character, and therefore doing <code>line = line[:-1]</code> would incorrectly strip off the last character of the line.</p>

<p>The most elegant way to solve this problem would be to define a generator which took the lines of the file and removed the last character from each line only if that character is a newline:</p>

<pre><code>def strip_trailing_newlines(file):
    for line in file:
        if line[-1] == '\n':
            yield line[:-1]
        else:
            yield line

f = open("myFile.txt", "r")
for line in strip_trailing_newlines(f):
    # do something with line
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Long time ago, there was Dear, clean, old, BASIC code that could run on 16 kb core machines:
like that: </p>

<pre><code>if (not open(1,"file.txt")) error "Could not open 'file.txt' for reading"
while(not eof(1)) 
  line input #1 a$
  print a$
wend
close
</code></pre>

<p>Now, to read a file line by line, with far better hardware and software (Python), we must reinvent the wheel:</p>

<pre><code>def line_input (file):
    for line in file:
        if line[-1] == '\n':
            yield line[:-1]
        else:
            yield line

f = open("myFile.txt", "r")
for line_input(f):
    # do something with line
</code></pre>

<p>I am induced to think that something has gone the wrong way  somewhere...</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You may also consider using line.rstrip() to remove the whitespaces at the end of your line.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>What do you thing about this approach?</p>

<pre><code>with open(filename) as data:
    datalines = (line.rstrip('\r\n') for line in data)
    for line in datalines:
        ...do something awesome...
</code></pre>

<p>Generator expression avoids loading whole file into memory and <code>with</code> ensures closing the file</p>
