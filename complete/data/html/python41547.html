<h3>Question (ID-41547):</h3><h2>Always including the user in the django template context</h2><p>I am working on a small intranet site for a small company, where user should be able to post. I have imagined a very simple authentication mechanism where people just enter their email address, and gets sent a unique login url, that sets a cookie that will always identify them for future requests.</p>

<p>In my template setup, I have base.html, and the other pages extend this. I want to show logged in or register button in the base.html, but how can I ensure that the necessary variables are always a part of the context? It seems that each view just sets up the context as they like, and there is no global context population. Is there a way of doing this without including the user in each context creation?</p>

<p>Or will I have to make my own custom shortcuts to setup the context properly?</p>

<p>@Staale: Adding user to the Context every time one is calling the template in view, DRY</p>

<p>Solution is very simple</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: In your settings add</p>

<pre><code>TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = (
    'myapp.processor_file_name.user',
)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>B</strong>: In myapp/processor_file_name.py insert</p>

<pre><code>def user(request):
    if hasattr(request, 'user'):
        return {'user':request.user }
    return {}
</code></pre>

<p>From now on you're able to use user object functionalities in your templates.</p>

<pre><code>{{ user.get_full_name }}
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>In a more general sense of not having to explicitly set variables in each view, it sounds like you want to look at writing your own <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/templates/api/#writing-your-own-context-processors" rel="nofollow">context processor</a>.</p>

<p>From the docs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A context processor has a very simple interface: It's just a Python function that takes one argument, an HttpRequest object, and returns a dictionary that gets added to the template context. Each context processor must return a dictionary.</p>
</blockquote>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>There is <strong>no need</strong> to write a context processor for the user object if you already have the "django.core.context_processors.auth" initialized. </p>

<p><a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth/#authentication-data-in-templates" rel="nofollow">http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth/#authentication-data-in-templates</a></p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>If you can hook your authentication into the <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/authentication/#authentication-in-web-requests" rel="nofollow">Django authentication scheme</a> you'll be able to use <code>request.user</code>.</p>

<p>I think this should just be a case of calling <code>authenticate()</code> and <code>login()</code> based on the contents of your Cookie.</p>

<p>Edit: @Staale - I always use the <a href="http://www.djangobook.com/en/1.0/chapter04/" rel="nofollow"><code>locals()</code> trick</a> for my context so all my templates can see <code>request</code> and so <code>request.user</code>.  If you're not then I guess it wouldn't be so straightforward.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>@Dave
To use {{user.username}} in my templates, I will then have to use 
requestcontext rather than just a normal map/hash: <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/templates_python/#subclassing-context-requestcontext" rel="nofollow">http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/templates_python/#subclassing-context-requestcontext</a></p>

<p>So I guess there are no globals that the template engine checks.</p>

<p>But the RequestContext has some prepopulate classes that I can look into to solve my problems. Thanks.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>its possible by default, by doing the following steps, ensure you have added the context 'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth' in your settings. By default its added in settings.py, so its looks like this </p>

<pre><code>TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = (
'django.core.context_processors.request',
'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',
'django.core.context_processors.auth',)
</code></pre>

<p>And you can access user object like this,</p>

<pre><code>{% if user.is_authenticated %}
&lt;p&gt;Welcome, {{ user.username }}. Thanks for logging in.&lt;/p&gt;
{% else %}
    &lt;p&gt;Welcome, new user. Please log in.&lt;/p&gt;
{% endif %}
</code></pre>
