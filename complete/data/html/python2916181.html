<h3>Question (ID-2916181):</h3><h2>What is the Pythonic way to implement a simple FSM?</h2><p>Yesterday I had to parse a very simple binary data file - the rule is, look for two bytes in a row that are both 0xAA, then the next byte will be a length byte, then skip 9 bytes and output the given amount of data from there. Repeat to the end of the file.</p>

<p>My solution did work, and was very quick to put together (even though I am a C programmer at heart, I still think it was quicker for me to write this in Python than it would have been in C) - BUT, it is clearly not at all Pythonic and it reads like a C program (and not a very good one at that!)</p>

<p>What would be a better / more Pythonic approach to this? Is a simple FSM like this even still the right choice in Python?</p>

<p>My solution:</p>

<pre><code>#! /usr/bin/python

import sys

f = open(sys.argv[1], "rb")

state = 0

if f:
    for byte in f.read():
        a = ord(byte)       
        if state == 0:
            if a == 0xAA:
                state = 1
        elif state == 1:
            if a  == 0xAA:
                state = 2
            else: 
                state = 0
        elif state == 2:
            count = a;
            skip = 9
            state = 3
        elif state == 3:
            skip = skip -1
            if skip == 0:
                state = 4
        elif state == 4:
             print "%02x" %a
             count = count -1 
             if count == 0:
                 state = 0
                 print "\r\n"

<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You could give your states constant names instead of using 0, 1, 2, etc. for improved readability.</p>

<p>You could use a dictionary to map <code>(current_state, input) -&gt; (next_state)</code>, but that doesn't really let you do any additional processing during the transitions.  Unless you include some "transition function" too to do extra processing.</p>

<p>Or you could do a non-FSM approach.  I think this will work as long as <code>0xAA 0xAA</code> only appears when it indicates a "start" (doesn't appear in data).</p>

<pre><code>with open(sys.argv[1], 'rb') as f:
    contents = f.read()
    for chunk in contents.split('\xaa\xaa')[1:]:
        length = ord(chunk[0])
        data = chunk[10:10+length]
        print data
</code></pre>

<p>If it does appear in data, you can instead use <code>string.find('\xaa\xaa', start)</code> to scan through the string, setting the <code>start</code> argument to begin looking where the last data block ended.  Repeat until it returns -1.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The coolest way I've seen to implement FSMs in Python has to be via generators and coroutines. See this <a href="http://gnosis.cx/publish/programming/charming_python_b5.html" rel="nofollow">Charming Python post</a> for an example. Eli Bendersky also has <a href="http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2009/08/29/co-routines-as-an-alternative-to-state-machines/" rel="nofollow">an excellent treatment of the subject</a>.</p>

<p>If coroutines aren't familiar territory, David Beazley's <a href="http://www.dabeaz.com/coroutines/index.html" rel="nofollow">A Curious Course on Coroutines and Concurrency</a> is a stellar introduction.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I am a little apprehensive about telling anyone what's Pythonic, but here goes.  First, keep in mind that in python functions are just objects.  Transitions can be defined with a dictionary that has the (input, current_state) as the key and the tuple (next_state, action) as the value.  Action is just a function that does whatever is necessary to transition from the current state to the next state.  </p>

<p>There's a nice looking example of doing this at <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/146262-finite-state-machine-fsm" rel="nofollow">http://code.activestate.com/recipes/146262-finite-state-machine-fsm</a>.  I haven't used it, but from a quick read it seems like it covers everything.</p>

<p>A similar question was asked/answered here a couple of months ago: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2101961/python-state-machine-design">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2101961/python-state-machine-design</a>.  You might find looking at those responses useful as well.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I think your solution looks fine, except you should replace <code>count = count - 1</code> with <code>count -= 1</code>.</p>

<p>This is one of those times where fancy code-show-offs will come up ways of have dicts mapping states to callables, with a small driver function, but it isn't better, just fancier, and using more obscure language features.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I suggest checking out <a href="http://gnosis.cx/TPiP/chap4.txt" rel="nofollow">chapter 4 of Text Processing in Python</a> by David Mertz. He implements a state machine class in Python that is very elegant.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I think the most pythonic way would by like what FogleBird suggested, but mapping from (current state, input) to a function which would handle the processing and transition.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>You can use regexps. Something like this code will find the first block of data. Then it's just a case of starting the next search from after the previous match.</p>

<pre><code>find_header = re.compile('\xaa\xaa(.).{9}', re.DOTALL)
m = find_header.search(input_text)
if m:
    length = chr(find_header.group(1))
    data = input_text[m.end():m.end() + length]
</code></pre>
