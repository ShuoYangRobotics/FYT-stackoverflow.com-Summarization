<h3>Question (ID-1633342):</h3><h2>Advice on set-up/management of the WSGI stack?</h2><p>After looking through the many useful and shiny Python frameworks, I find none of them get close to what I need or provide <em>way</em> more than my needs. I'm looking to put something together myself; could define it as a framework, but not full-stack. However, I can't find online what the Python community sees as the correct/standard way to manage WSGI middleware in an application.</p>

<p>I'm not looking for framework suggestions, unless its to provide an example of ways to manage WSGI middleware. Nor am I looking for information on how to get a webserver to talk to python -- that bit I understand.</p>

<p>Rather, I'm looking for advice on how one tells python what components/middleware to put into the stack, and in which order. For instance, if I wanted to use:<br />
<code>Spawning--&gt;memento--&gt;AuthKit--&gt;(?)--&gt;MyApp</code><br />
how would I get those components into the right order, and how would I configure an additional item (say Routes) before <code>MyApp</code>?</p>

<p>So; Can you advise on the common/correct/standard way of managing what middleware is included in a WSGI stack for a Python application?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong><br />
Thanks to Michael Dillon for recommending <a href="http://pythonpaste.org/do-it-yourself-framework.html" rel="nofollow">A Do-It-Yourself Framework</a>, which helps highlight my problem. The <a href="http://pythonpaste.org/do-it-yourself-framework.html#give-me-more-middleware" rel="nofollow">middleware section</a> of that document states that one should wrap middleware A in middleware B, B in C, and so-on:</p>

<pre><code>app = ObjectPublisher(Root())
wrapped_app = AuthMiddleware(app)
from paste.evalexception import EvalException
exc_wrapped_app = EvalException(wrapped_app)
</code></pre>

<p>Which shows how to do it in a very simple way. I understand how this works, however it seems too simple when working with a number of middleware packages.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a better way to manage how these middleware components are added to the stack? Maybe a common design pattern which reads from a config file?</strong></p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>That is what a framework does. Some frameworks like Django are fairly rigid and others like Pylons make it easier to mix and match. </p>

<p>Since you will likely be using some of the WSGI components from the Paste project sooner or later, you might as well read this article from the Paste folks about a <a href="http://pythonpaste.org/do-it-yourself-framework.html" rel="nofollow">Do-It-Yourself Framework</a>. I'm not suggesting that you should go and build your own framework, but that the article gives a good explanation of how the WSGI stack works and how things go together.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I'd have to say that Apache/mod_wsgi is probably the most "manageable" of the setups I've used.</p>

<p>nginx/fcgi is the fastest, but its a bit of a headache.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>What middleware do you think you need? You may very well not need to include any WSGI ‘middleware’-like components at all. You can perfectly well put together a loose ‘pseudo-framework’ of standalone libraries without needing to ‘wrap’ the application in middleware at all.</p>

<p>(Personally I use a separate form-reading library, data access layer and template engine, none of which know about each other or need to start fiddling with the WSGI <code>environ</code>.)</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>My advice is to read the <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/" rel="nofollow">PEP</a> on WSGI, specifically the part on <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/#middleware-components-that-play-both-sides" rel="nofollow">middleware</a>. If you have a question about anything with the words "standard" and "WSGI" in it, the answer is either there, or you're asking the wrong question.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>If you liked the Do-It-Yourself-Framework tutorial mentioned before, but you want to manage these things in a config file, <a href="http://pythonpaste.org/deploy/" rel="nofollow">Paste Deploy</a> would be the obvious answer. (It is mentioned in the tutorial, but only very briefly in the very last paragraph).</p>

<p>This is what the Pylons framework uses, by the way (and Turbogears 2, which is built upon Pylons, also).</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>"it seems too simple when working with a number of middleware packages."</p>

<p>How big a number?</p>

<p>You won't be working with hundreds or thousands.  </p>

<p>It will be (a) a small number (under a dozen) and (b) the "right" order isn't magical. </p>

<p>Each piece of middleware will have a very, very specific job and very specific requirements for what must come before it.  </p>

<p>It's much less confusing than you're assuming.</p>
