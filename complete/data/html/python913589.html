<h3>Question (ID-913589):</h3><h2>Django forms, inheritance and order of form fields</h2><p>I'm using Django forms in my website and would like to control the order of the fields.</p>

<p>Here's how I define my forms:</p>

<pre><code>class edit_form(forms.Form):
    summary = forms.CharField()
    description = forms.CharField(widget=forms.TextArea)


class create_form(edit_form):
    name = forms.CharField()
</code></pre>

<p>The name is immutable and should only be listed when the entity is created. I use inheritance to add consistency and DRY principles. What happens which is not erroneous, in fact totally expected, is that the name field is listed last in the view/html but I'd like the name field to be on top of summary and description. I do realize that I could easily fix it by copying summary and description into create_form and loose the inheritance but I'd like to know if this is possible. </p>

<p><strong>Why?</strong> Imagine you've got 100 fields in edit_form and have to add 10 fields on the top in create_form - copying and maintaining the two forms wouldn't look so sexy then. (This is <em>not</em> my case, I'm just making up an example)</p>

<p>So, how can I override this behavior?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>Apparently there's no proper way to do this without going through nasty hacks (fiddling with .field attribute). The .field attribute is a SortedDict (one of Django's internal datastructures) which doesn't provide any way to reorder key:value pairs. It does how-ever provide a way to insert items at a given index but that would move the items from the class members and into the constructor. This method would work, but make the code less readable. The only other way I see fit is to modify the framework itself which is less-than-optimal in most situations.</p>

<p>In short the code would become something like this:</p>

<pre><code>class edit_form(forms.Form):
    summary = forms.CharField()
    description = forms.CharField(widget=forms.TextArea)


class create_form(edit_form):
    def __init__(self,*args,**kwargs):
        forms.Form.__init__(self,*args,**kwargs)

        self.fields.insert(0,'name',forms.CharField())
</code></pre>

<p>That shut me up :) </p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I had this same problem and I found another technique for reordering fields in the <a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/CookBookNewFormsFieldOrdering" rel="nofollow">Django CookBook</a>:</p>

<pre><code>class edit_form(forms.Form):
    summary = forms.CharField()
    description = forms.CharField(widget=forms.TextArea)


class create_form(edit_form):
    name = forms.CharField()

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super(edit_form, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.fields.keyOrder = ['name', 'summary', 'description']
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I used the solution posted by Selene but found that it removed all fields which weren't assigned to keyOrder. The form that I'm subclassing has a lot of fields so this didn't work very well for me. I coded up this function to solve the problem using akaihola's answer, but if you want it to work like Selene's all you need to do is set <code>throw_away</code> to <code>True</code>.</p>

<pre><code>def order_fields(form, field_list, throw_away=False):
    """
    Accepts a form and a list of dictionary keys which map to the
    form's fields. After running the form's fields list will begin
    with the fields in field_list. If throw_away is set to true only
    the fields in the field_list will remain in the form.

    example use:
    field_list = ['first_name', 'last_name']
    order_fields(self, field_list)
    """
    if throw_away:
        form.fields.keyOrder = field_list
    else:
        for field in field_list[::-1]:
            form.fields.insert(0, field, form.fields.pop(field))
</code></pre>

<p>This is how I'm using it in my own code:</p>

<pre><code>class NestableCommentForm(ExtendedCommentSecurityForm):
    # TODO: Have min and max length be determined through settings.
    comment = forms.CharField(widget=forms.Textarea, max_length=100)
    parent_id = forms.IntegerField(widget=forms.HiddenInput, required=False)

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super(NestableCommentForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        order_fields(self, ['comment', 'captcha'])
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>See the notes in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/350799/how-does-django-know-the-order-to-render-form-fields">this SO question</a> on the way Django's internals keep track of field order; the answers include suggestions on how to "reorder" fields to your liking (in the end it boils down to messing with the <code>.fields</code> attribute).</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Like Selenes answer, just a short comment - guess it is a typo and
that the call to super should be:</p>

<pre><code>super(create_form, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
</code></pre>

<p>and not:</p>

<pre><code>super(edit_form, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You could also create a decorator to order fields (inspired by Joshua's solution):</p>

<pre><code>def order_fields(*field_list):
    def decorator(form):
        original_init = form.__init__
        def init(self, *args, **kwargs):
            original_init(self, *args, **kwargs)        
            for field in field_list[::-1]:
                self.fields.insert(0, field, self.fields.pop(field))
        form.__init__ = init
        return form            
    return decorator
</code></pre>

<p>This will ensure that all the fields passed to the decorator come first.
You can use it like this:</p>

<pre><code>@order_fields('name')
class CreateForm(EditForm):
    name = forms.CharField()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Alternate methods for changing the field order:</p>

<p>Pop-and-insert:</p>

<pre><code>self.fields.insert(0, 'name', self.fields.pop('name'))
</code></pre>

<p>Pop-and-append:</p>

<pre><code>self.fields['summary'] = self.fields.pop('summary')
self.fields['description'] = self.fields.pop('description')
</code></pre>

<p>Pop-and-append-all:</p>

<pre><code>for key in ('name', 'summary', 'description'):
    self.fields[key] = self.fields.pop(key)
</code></pre>

<p>Ordered-copy:</p>

<pre><code>self.fields = SortedDict( [ (key, self.fields[key])
                            for key in ('name', 'summary' ,'description') ] )
</code></pre>

<p>But Selene's approach from the Django CookBook still feels clearest of all.</p>
