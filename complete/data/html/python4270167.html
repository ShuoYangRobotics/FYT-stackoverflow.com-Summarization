<h3>Question (ID-4270167):</h3><h2>Why avoid while loops?</h2><p>I'm about 2 weeks deep in my study of Python as an introductory language.  I've hit a point in Zed's <em>"Learn Python the Hard Way"</em> where he suggests:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use a while-loop only to loop forever, and that means probably never.  This only applies
      to Python, other languages are different.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've googled all over this, referenced everything I can, but I can't find any reason in the world why this would be a convention in Python.  What makes it different? </p>

<p>When I gave up programming 10 years ago, I was working in VB and would regularly be told to get rid of my For loops and use While loops instead.  I was a hack (as I am today, though I wrote a LOT of code back then), so I just did what I was told without questioning it.  Well, now I'm questioning it.  Is this a speed issue?  Is it just to avoid escape-less infinites?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-12):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The advice seems poor to me. When you're iterating over some kind of collection, it is usually <em>better</em> to use one of Python's iteration tools, but that doesn't mean that <code>while</code> is always wrong. There are lots of cases where you're not iterating over any kind of collection.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>def gcd(m, n):
    "Return the greatest common divisor of m and n."
    while n != 0:
        m, n = n, m % n
    return m
</code></pre>

<p>You could change this to:</p>

<pre><code>def gcd(m, n):
    "Return the greatest common divisor of m and n."
    while True:
        if n == 0:
            return m
        m, n = n, m % n
</code></pre>

<p>but is that really an improvement? I think not.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Python follows the philosophy of </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There should be one-- and preferably
  only one --obvious way to do it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(see <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/" rel="nofollow">http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/</a> for details).</p>

<p>And in most cases there is a better way to do iterations in Python than using a while loop.</p>

<p>Additionally at least CPython optimizes other kinds of loops and iterations (I consider <em>map</em> and list comprehensions as kinds of iteration) better than while loops.</p>

<p>Example: <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/essays/list2str.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.python.org/doc/essays/list2str.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use intrinsic operations. An implied
  loop in map() is faster than an
  explicit for loop; a while loop with
  an explicit loop counter is even
  slower.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have no explanation why you were told to use while loops instead of for loops in VB - I think it normally leads neither to better readable nor to faster code there.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>It's because in the typical situation where you want to iterate, python can handle it for you. For example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; mylist = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
&gt;&gt;&gt; for item in mylist:
...     print item
... 
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
</code></pre>

<p>Similar example with a dictionary:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; mydict = {1:'a', 2:'b', 3:'c', 4:'d'}
&gt;&gt;&gt; for key in mydict:
...     print "%d-&gt;%s" % (key, mydict[key])
... 
1-&gt;a
2-&gt;b
3-&gt;c
4-&gt;d
</code></pre>

<p>Using a <code>while</code> loop just isn't necessary in a lot of common usage scenarios (and is not "pythonic").</p>

<hr>

<p>Here's one comparison from a <a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/tutor/2005-January/035201.html" rel="nofollow">mailing list post</a> that I though was a good illustration, too:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>> 2. I know Perl is different, but there's just no equivalent of while</em><br>
  <em>> <code>($line = &lt;A_FILE&gt;) { }</code> ?</em></p>
  
  <p>Python's 'for' loop has built-in
  knowledge about "iterable" objects,
  and that includes files.  Try using:</p>

<pre><code>for line in file:
    ...
</code></pre>
  
  <p>which should do the trick.</p>
</blockquote>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>It is not a speed issue, and it is what it is, a suggestion.</p>

<p>I think the intention is to make the code more explicit and easier to read. If you can write it without a while loop in python, it probably looks cleaner and is easier to understand.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>The general issue with while loops is that it is easy to overlook, or somehow skip the statement where the loop variable gets incremented.  Even a C for-loop can have this problem - you <em>can</em> write <code>for(int x=0; x&lt;10;)</code>, although it is unlikely.  But a Python for loop has no such problem, since it takes care of advancing the iterator for you.  On the other hand, a while loop forces you to implement a never fail increment.</p>

<pre><code>s = "ABCDEF"
i = 0
while (i &lt; len(s)):
    if s[i] in "AEIOU":
        print s[i], 'is a vowel'
        i += 1
</code></pre>

<p>is an infinite loop as soon as you hit the first non-vowel.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>A while loop is a tool, nothing more. To use it or not use it is a matter of whether it's the right tool for the job, nothing more. You are right to question the advice, it's silly.</p>

<p>That being said, there are constructs in python that obviate the need for while loops some of the time. For example, list comprehensions do things one might ordinarily do with a while or for loop. </p>

<p>Use the right tool for the job, don't try to memorize and stick to a bunch of rules. The goal is to write code that a) works and b) is clear. </p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; counter = 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; while counter &lt; 5:
       print counter
       counter += 1         
0
1
2
3
4

&gt;&gt;&gt; for x in range(5):
       print x          
0
1
2
3
4
</code></pre>

<p>See for yourself, which one do you prefer? ;)</p>

<p>When an easier to understand and easier to read code works, that is the <code>Python-ic</code> way.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Let me share a secret with you:  Nine times out of ten with python, the answer is just "use common sense".  It's not a terribly tricky language (aside from some notable gotchas).  In this case, I'd consider Zed's rule of thumb superfluous because it's almost always common sense to know what kind of loop to use.</p>

<p>That said, if I run into a situation that requires iteration and I have a choice, I prefer the following (from greatest to least preference):</p>

<ol>
<li>List/generator/set/dict comprehension</li>
<li>For loop</li>
<li>While loop</li>
<li>Recursion</li>
</ol>

<p>Comprehensions are simple, but it's surprising how many times you can make a for loop into one if you put thought into it.  But generally, I'd say that about 90% of all iteration I'll do is with a list comprehension or a for loop.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>Also there are list comprehensions e.g.:
<br><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; vec = [2, 4, 6]</code>
<br><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; [3*x for x in vec]</code>
<br><code>[6, 12, 18]</code></p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>This is an idiom I use frequently:</p>

<pre><code>done = False
while not done:
    done = DoSomeStuffAndReturnTrueIfAllDone()
    # wait a while before polling again for more work
    time.sleep(5)
</code></pre>

<p>I could pull this out into a generator, sure, but I don't see that as a win. Are there other pythonic ways to do this?</p>

<p>Edited to clarify that I'm periodically polling for work.</p>
<br /><b>#10</b><br /><p>The for loop is best for looping through a collection. I mostly think of the for loop as a "definite loop."  Using a for loop for a collection prevents errors arising from attempting to use indices that are out of bounds or from accidentally using negative indices.  Unless you are in a special situation, use a for loop for traversing a collection.</p>

<p>The while loop is most useful for situations where you may have to repeat an action an indefinite number of times.  It is the "indefinite loop".  The example shown above for calculating a gcd is a prime example of where to use a while loop.  You must bear in mind that the predicate in the while must change, or you could get stuck in an infinite loop.</p>

<p>If at all possible, avoid using break to get out of a loop.  </p>
<br /><b>#11</b><br /><p>I think that using infinite loop is conceptually wrong, because an algorithm is, by its definition, composed by a finite numbers of instructions (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm" rel="nofollow">wikipedia</a>): </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In mathematics, computer science, and related subjects, an algorithm [...] is an effective method for solving a problem expressed as a finite sequence of steps.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my opinion is better to find another solution than the infinite loop whenever possible, and this applies to every programming language past, present and future.</p>
