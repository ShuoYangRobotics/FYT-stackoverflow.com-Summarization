<h3>Question (ID-1118163):</h3><h2>Turbogears 2 vs Django - any advice on choosing replacement for Turbogears 1?</h2><p>I have been using Turbogears 1 for prototyping small sites for the last couple of years and it is getting a little long in the tooth. Any suggestions on making the call between upgrading to Turbogears 2 or switching to something like Django? I'm torn between the familiarity of the TG community who are pretty responsive and do pretty good documentation vs the far larger community using Django. I am quite tempted by the built-in CMS features and the Google AppEngine support.</p>

<p>Any advice?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>.M.</p>

I think it's more AJAX-friendly than Django by the way pages can be easly published in HTML or JSON .</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I have experience with both Django and TG1.1.</p>

<p>IMO, TurboGears strong point is it's ORM: SQLAlchemy. I prefer TurboGears when the database side of things is non-trivial.</p>

<p>Django's ORM is just not that flexible and powerful.</p>

<p>That being said, I prefer Django. If the database schema is a good fit with Django's ORM I would go with Django.</p>

<p>In my experience, it is simply less hassle to use Django compared with TurboGears.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I have been using Django for a year now and when I started I had no experience of Python or Django and found it very intuitive to use.</p>

<p>I have created a number of hobbyist Google App Engine apps using Django with the latest one being a CMS for my site. Using Django has meant that I have been able to code a lot quicker and with a lot less bugs.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Am sure you would have read from plenty of comparison between TurboGears and DJango on web.</p>

<p>But as for your temptation on CMS and GAE, i can really think you got to go DJango way. 
Check these out, and decide youself.</p>

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Ive only got one question...is the app you are developing directed towards social networking
  or customized business logic?</p>

<p>I personally find Django is good for social networking and pylons/turbogears if you really
  want the flexibility and no boundaries...</p>

<p>just my 2c</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>TG2 seem much complicated and confusing, even for doing somewhat simple like a login page with multimple error messages

I think thats because of intemperance in modularity...</p>
