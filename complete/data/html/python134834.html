<h3>Question (ID-134834):</h3><h2>Beginner wondering if his code is 'Pythonic'</h2><p>This is really the first thing that I have written in python.  I come from Java background.  I don't want to just learn how to program java code with Python syntax.  I want to learn how to program in a pythonic paradigm.</p>

<p>Could you guys please comment on how I can make the following code more pythonic?</p>

<pre><code>from math import sqrt

# recursively computes the factors of a number
def factors(num):
    factorList = []
    numroot = int(sqrt(num)) + 1
    numleft = num
    # brute force divide the number until you find a factor
    for i in range(2, numroot):
        if num % i == 0:
            # if we found a factor, add it to the list and compute the remainder
            factorList.append(i)
            numleft = num / i
            break
    # if we didn't find a factor, get out of here!
    if numleft == num: 
        factorList.append(num)
        return factorList
    # now recursively find the rest of the factors
    restFactors = factors(numleft)
    factorList.extend(restFactors)

    return factorList

# grabs  all of the twos in the list and puts them into 2 ^ x form
def transformFactorList(factorList):
    num2s = 0
    # remove all twos, counting them as we go
    while 2 in factorList:
        factorList.remove(2)
        num2s += 1
    # simply return the list with the 2's back in the right spot
    if num2s == 0: return factorList
    if num2s == 1:
        factorList.insert(0, 2)
        return factorList
    factorList.insert(0, '2 ^ ' + str(num2s))
    return factorList

print transformFactorList(factors(#some number))

<ul>
<li><p><code>joined_lower</code> for functions, methods,
attributes</p></li>
<li><p><code>joined_lower</code> or ALL_CAPS for
constants</p></li>
<li><p><code>StudlyCaps</code> for classes</p></li>
<li><p><code>camelCase</code> only to conform to
pre-existing conventions</p></li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Just use 'import math' and 'math.sqrt()' instead of 'from math import sqrt' and 'sqrt()'; you don't win anything by just importing 'sqrt', and code quickly gets unwieldy with too many from-imports. Also, things like reload() and mocking out for tests break a lot faster when you use from-import a lot.</p>

<p>The divmod() function is a convenient way to perform both division and modulo. You can use for/else instead of the separate check on numleft. Your factors function is a natural candidate for a generator. xrange() was already mentioned in another answer. Here's it all done that way:</p>

<pre><code>import math

# recursively computes the factors of a number as a generator
def factors(num):
    numroot = int(math.sqrt(num)) + 1
    # brute force divide the number until you find a factor
    for i in xrange(2, numroot):
        divider, remainder = divmod(num, i)
        if not remainder:
            # if we found a factor, add it to the list and compute the
            # remainder
            yield i
            break
    else:
    # if we didn't find a factor, get out of here!
        yield num
        return
    # now recursively find the rest of the factors
    for factor in factors(divider):
        yield factor
</code></pre>

<p>Using a generator does mean you can only iterate over the result once; if you simply want a list (like you do in translateFactorsList) you will have to wrap the call to factors() in list().</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>One other thing you might want to look at is the docstring.  For example, the comment for this function:</p>

<pre><code># recursively computes the factors of a number
def factors(num):
</code></pre>

<p>Could be converted into this:</p>

<pre><code>def factors(num):
    """ recursively computes the factors of a number"""
</code></pre>

<p>It's not really 100% necessary to do it this way, but it's a good habit to get into in case you ever start using something along the lines of pydoc.</p>

<p>You can also do this:</p>

<h3>docstring.py</h3>

<pre><code>"""This is a docstring"""
</code></pre>

<h3>at the command line:</h3>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import docstring
&gt;&gt;&gt; help(docstring)
</code></pre>

<h3>results:</h3>

<pre><code>Help on module docstring:

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>A few comments:</p>

<ol>
<li>I would replace <code>range()</code> with <code>xrange()</code>; when you call <code>range()</code>, it allocates the entire range all at once, whereas when you iterate over <code>xrange()</code>, it returns each result one at a time, saving memory.</li>
<li>Don't put expressions after conditionals on the same line (<code>if num2s -- 0: return factorList</code>). It makes it harder to see at a glance what it's doing (that it's a block).</li>
<li>Don't be afraid to use modules. The <code>[sympy][1]</code> module already has code to compute factors, which may simplify your code by eliminating most of it.</li>
<li>Python's string formatting is simple and effective.</li>
</ol>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>factorList.insert(0, '2 ^ ' + str(num2s))
</code></pre>

<p>could be changed to </p>

<pre><code>factorlist.insert(0, '2 ^ %s' % num2s)
</code></pre>

<p>All in all, I don't find your code to be extensively un-pythonic. Just make sure you want to use <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.2.3/whatsnew/node7.html" rel="nofollow">floor division</a>, because that's what tends to happen by default with integer values. Otherwise, you'll need to fix up the division operator:</p>

<pre><code>from __future__ import division
</code></pre>

<p>A sometimes-frustrating caveat of the language.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><pre><code>from itertools import takewhile

def transform_factor_list(factor_list):
    num_2s = len(list(takewhile(lambda e: e == 2, factor_list)))
    if num_2s &gt; 1:
        factor_list[:num_2s] = ["2 ^ %i" % (num_2s, )]
    return factor_list
</code></pre>

<p>That's what I would make out of the second function. </p>

<p>Most pythonic changes:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow">PEP-8</a> compatible naming</li>
<li>slicing (and assigning to slices)</li>
<li>iterators</li>
<li>string formatting</li>
</ul>

<p>The function assumes that the input is ordered, which is fulfilled by factors.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: removed special cases for some lists, more compact this way</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Based on chris's answer, slightly simplified:</p>

<ul>
<li>for instead of external while</li>
<li>internal while to preserve ability to use same divisor repeatedly</li>
<li>use itertools.groupby simplifies compress() by much</li>
<li>fix a small bug in tostring()</li>
</ul>

<p>HTH:</p>

<pre><code>import itertools

def factorize(n):
    # ideally an iterator of prime numbers
    # this'll work though
    divisors = itertools.count(2)

    for divisor in divisors:
        # This condition is very clever!
        # Note that `n` is decreasing, while `divisor` is increasing.
        # And we know that `n` is not divisible by anything smaller,
        # so this stops as soon as the remaining `n` is obviously prime.
        if divisor**2 &gt; n:
            yield n
            break

        while n % divisor == 0:
            yield divisor
            n //= divisor

    for (factor, copies) in itertools.groupby(factors):

        # Using list() to count its length.
        power = len(list(copies))
        yield (factor, power)

def tostring(compressed):
    return ' * '.join("%d**%d" % (factor, power) for (factor, power) in compressed)

# test

<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Don't be afraid of list comprehensions.  Switching from Java to Python and discovering them was a good day.</p>

<p>For the factors function, maybe something like this:</p>

<pre><code>def factors(num):
    return [i for i in xrange(1, num+1) if num % i == 0]
</code></pre>

<p>Probably not the best code but it's short and easy to understand.</p>

<p>Good luck with Python, it's a great language. </p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>this is how I'd do this...</p>

<pre><code>import itertools
import collections

def factorize(n):
	# ideally an iterator of prime numbers
	# this'll work though
	divisors = itertools.count(2)

	divisor = divisors.next()
	while True:
		if divisor**2 &gt; n:
			yield n
			break

		a,b = divmod(n, divisor)

		if b == 0:
			yield divisor
			n = a
		else:
			divisor = divisors.next()

def compress(factors):
	summands = collections.defaultdict(lambda: 0)

	for factor in factors:
		summands[factor] += 1

	return [(base, summands[base]) for base in sorted(summands)]

def tostring(compressed):
	return ' * '.join("%d**%d" % factor for factor in compressed)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>Here's what jumps out at me:</p>

<pre><code>def transformFactorList(factorList):
    oldsize = len(factorList)
    factorList = [f for f in factorList if f != 2]
    num2s = oldsize - len(factorList)
    if num2s == 0:
        return []
    if num2s == 1:
        return [2]+factorList
     return ['2 ^ %s' % num2s] + [factorList]
</code></pre>

<p>The form <code>[f for f in factorList if f != 2]</code> is called a list-comprehension.</p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>Since this post seems to be resurrected by Casey (lol), I'll add in my 2 cents.</p>

<p>Go over everything in <strong><a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow">PEP-8</a></strong>. It helped me out substantially when I had code formatting issues.</p>
<br /><b>#10</b><br /><p>Using recursion (where not necessary) is not pythonic. Python doesn't have tail recursion elimination and <em>flat is better than nested</em>.</p>

<p>When in doubt, try <code>import this</code></p>

<p><strong>update</strong>: by popular request, here goes the iterative factorization (sigh):</p>

<pre><code>"""returns an iterator of tuples (factor, power) such that 
reduce(operator.mul, (factor**power for factor, power in factors(n))) == n """
def factors(n):
    i = 2
    while n &gt; 1:
        p = 0
        while n &gt; 1 and n % i == 0:
            p += 1
            n /= i
        if p:
            yield (i, p)
        i += 1
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#11</b><br /><p>I'd use a list comprehension to get the twos out:</p>

<pre><code>def transformFactorList(factorList):
    twos = [x for x in factorList if x == 2]
    rest = [x for x in factorList if x != 2]
    rest.insert(0, "2 ^ %d" % len(twos))
    return rest
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this will give you <code>2^0</code> and <code>2^1</code>, which your code didn't. What you're doing with the twos seems arbitraty (sometimes you get a string, sometimes a number, sometimes nothing), so I figured that would be fine. You can change that easily if you want:</p>

<pre><code>def transformFactorList(factorList):
    twos = [x for x in factorList if x == 2]
    rest = [x for x in factorList if x != 2]
    if twos:
        rest.insert(0, 2 if len(twos)==1 else "2 ^ %d" % len(twos))
    return rest
</code></pre>
