<h3>Question (ID-3188929):</h3><h2>Why import when you need to use the full name?</h2><p>In python, if you need a module from a different package you have to import it. Coming from a Java background, that makes sense.</p>

<pre><code>import foo.bar
</code></pre>

<p>What doesn't make sense though, is why do I need to use the full name whenever I want to use bar? If I wanted to use the full name, why do I need to import? Doesn't using the full name immediately describe which module I'm addressing?</p>

<p>It just seems a little redundant to have <code>from foo import bar</code> when that's what <code>import foo.bar</code> should be doing. Also a little vague why I had to import when I was going to use the full name.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The thing is, even though Python's <code>import</code> statement is designed to <em>look</em> similar to Java's, they do completely different things under the hood. As you know, in Java an <code>import</code> statement is really little more than a hint to the compiler. It basically sets up an alias for a fully qualified class name. For example, when you write</p>

<pre><code>import java.util.Set;
</code></pre>

<p>it tells the compiler that throughout that file, when you write <code>Set</code>, you mean <code>java.util.Set</code>. And if you write <code>s.add(o)</code> where <code>s</code> is an object of type <code>Set</code>, the compiler (or rather, linker) goes out and finds the <code>add</code> method in <code>Set.class</code> and puts in a reference to it.</p>

<p>But in Python,</p>

<pre><code>import util.set
</code></pre>

<p>(that is a made-up module, by the way) does something completely different. Since Python is an interpreted language with dynamic resolution, there's no compiler to go out and look up the code of any <code>util.set</code> module. What happens in Python is that the interpreter looks for a package named <code>util</code> with a module named <code>set</code> inside it and loads the package and module, and in the process, it actually creates an object named <code>util</code> with an attribute named <code>set</code>. (That's right, packages and modules are actual first-class objects in Python.) You could think of the above statement as</p>

<pre><code>util = __import__('util.set')
</code></pre>

<p>where the function <code>__import__</code> produces an object which has an attribute called <code>set</code>. In fact, that's actually what happens when you import a module - see the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html" rel="nofollow">documentation for <code>__import__</code></a>. So you see, when you import a Python module, what you really get is just an object corresponding to the top-level package, <code>util</code>, and in order to get access to <code>set</code> you need to go through that.</p>

<p>As mentioned in at least one other answer, you could write</p>

<pre><code>from util import set
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>import util.set as set
</code></pre>

<p>This still imports the package <code>util</code> with the module <code>set</code> in it, but instead of creating a variable <code>util</code> in the current scope, it creates a variable <code>set</code> that refers to <code>util.set</code>. Behind the scenes, this works kind of like</p>

<pre><code>_util = __import__('util', fromlist='set')
set = _util.set
del _util
</code></pre>

<p>in the former case, or</p>

<pre><code>_util = __import__('util.set')
set = _util.set
del _util
</code></pre>

<p>in the latter (although both ways do essentially the same thing). This form is semantically more like what Java does; it defines an alias (<code>set</code>) to something that would ordinarily only be accessible by a fully qualified name (<code>util.set</code>).</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You can shorten it, if you would like:</p>

<pre><code>import foo.bar as whateveriwant
</code></pre>

<p>Using the full name prevents two packages with the same-named submodules from clobbering each other.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You're a bit confused about how Python imports work. (I was too when I first started.) In Python, you can't simply refer to something within a module by the full name, unlike in Java; you HAVE to import the module first, regardless of how you plan on referring to the imported item. Try typing <code>math.sqrt(5)</code> in the interpreter without importing <code>math</code> or <code>math.sqrt</code> first and see what happens.</p>

<p>Anyway... the reason <code>import foo.bar</code> has you required to use <code>foo.bar</code> instead of just <code>bar</code> is to prevent accidental namespace conflicts. For example, what if you do <code>import foo.bar</code>, and then <code>import baz.bar</code>?</p>

<p>You could, of course, choose to do <code>import foo.bar as bar</code> (i.e. aliasing), but if you're doing that you may as well just use <code>from foo import bar</code>. (EDIT: except when you want to import methods and variables. Then you have to use the <code>from ... import ...</code> syntax. This includes instances where you want to import a method or variable without aliasing, i.e. you can't simply do <code>import foo.bar</code> if <code>bar</code> is a method or variable.)</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>in Python, importing doesn't just indicate you might use something.  The import actually executes code at the module level.  You can think of the import as being the moment where the functions are 'interpreted' and created.  Any code that is in the <strong>__<em>init</em>__</strong>.py level or not inside a function or class definition happens then.</p>

<p>The import also makes an inexpensive copy of the whole module's namespace and puts it inside the namespace of the file / module / whatever where it is imported.  An IDE then has a list of the functions you might be starting to type for command completion.  </p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>There is a module in the standard library called <code>io</code>:</p>

<pre><code>In [84]: import io

In [85]: io
Out[85]: &lt;module 'io' from '/usr/lib/python2.6/io.pyc'&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>There is also a module in <code>scipy</code> called <code>io</code>:</p>

<pre><code>In [95]: import scipy.io

In [96]: scipy.io
Out[96]: &lt;module 'scipy.io' from '/usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/scipy/io/__init__.pyc'&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you wanted to use both modules in the same script, then namespaces are a convenient way to distinguish the two.</p>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Part of the Python philosophy is <a href="http://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/" rel="nofollow">explicit is better than implicit</a>. Python could automatically import the first time you try to access something from a package, but that's not explicit.</p>

<p>I'm also guessing that package initialization would be much more difficult if the imports were automatic, as it wouldn't be done consistently in the code.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Other than in Java, in Python <code>import foo.bar</code> declares, that you are going to use the thing referred to by <code>foo.bar</code>.</p>

<p>This matches with Python's philosophy that explicit is better than implicit. There are more programming languages that make inter-module dependencies more explicit than Java, for example Ada.</p>

<p>Using the full name makes it possible to disambiguate definitions with the same name coming from different modules.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>You don't have to use the full name.  Try one of these</p>

<pre><code>from foo import bar

import foo.bar as bar

import foo.bar
bar = foo.bar

from foo import *
</code></pre>

<p>A few reasons why explicit imports are good:</p>

<ul>
<li>They help signal to humans and tools what packages your module depends on.</li>
<li>They avoid the overhead of dynamically determining which packages have to be loaded (and possibly compiled) at run time.</li>
<li>They (along with sys.path) unambiguously distinguish symbols with conflicting names from different namespaces.</li>
<li>They give the programmer some control of what enters the namespace within which he is working.</li>
</ul>
