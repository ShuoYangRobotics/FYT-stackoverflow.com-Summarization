<h3>Question (ID-2851182):</h3><h2>python: how/where to put a simple library installed in a well-known-place on my computer</h2><p>I need to put a python script somewhere on my computer so that in another file I can use it. How do I do this and where do I put it? And where in the python documentation do I learn how to do this? I'm a beginner + don't use python much.</p>

<hr>

<p>library file: MyLib.py put in a well-known place</p>

<pre><code>def myfunc():
   ....
</code></pre>

<p>other file SourceFile.py located elsewhere, doesn't need to know where MyLib.py is:</p>

<pre><code>something = MyLib.myfunc()
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>In general, the <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/modules.html" rel="nofollow">Modules</a> section of the Python tutorial is a good introduction for beginners on this topic.  It explains how to write your own modules and where to put them, but I'll summarize the answer to your question below:</p>

<p>Your Python installation has a <code>site-packages</code> directory; any python file you put in that directory will be available to any script you write.  For example, if you put the file <code>MyLib.py</code> in the <code>site-packages</code> directory, then in your script you can say</p>

<pre><code>import MyLib
something = MyLib.myfunc()
</code></pre>

<p>If you're not sure where Python is installed, the Stack Overflow question <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/122327/how-do-i-find-the-location-of-my-python-site-packages-directory">How do I find the location of my Python site-packages directory</a> will be helpful to you.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can modify <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/sys.html#sys.path" rel="nofollow">sys.path</a>, which is a list of directories where Python looks for libraries when you use the <code>import</code> statement.  Your <code>site-packages</code> directory is already in this list, but you can add (or remove) entries yourself.  For example, if you wanted to put your <code>MyLib.py</code> file in <code>/usr/local/pythonModules</code>, you could say</p>

<pre><code>import sys
sys.path.append("/usr/local/pythonModules")
import MyLib
something = MyLib.myfunc()
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, you could use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONPATH" rel="nofollow">PYTHONPATH</a> environment variable to indicate the directory where your <code>MyLib.py</code> is located.</p>

<p>However, I recommend simply placing your <code>MyLib.py</code> file in the <code>site-packages</code> directory, as described above.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><h2>Option 1:</h2>

<p>Put your file at:
<code>&lt;Wherever your Python is&gt;/Lib/site-packages/myfile.py</code></p>

<p>Add this to your code:</p>

<pre><code>import myfile
</code></pre>

<p>Pros: Easy</p>

<p>Cons: Clutters site-packages</p>

<h2>Option 2:</h2>

<p>Put your file at:
/Lib/site-packages/mypackage/myfile.py</p>

<p>Create an empty text file called:
<code>&lt;Wherever your Python is&gt;/Lib/site-packages/mypackage/__init__.py</code></p>

<p>Add this to your code:</p>

<pre><code>from mypackage import myfile
</code></pre>

<p>Pros: Reduces clutter in site-packages by keeping your stuff consolidated in a single directory</p>

<p>Cons: Slightly more work; still some clutter in site-packages.  This isn't bad for stable stuff, but may be regarded as inappropriate for development work, and may be impossible if Python is installed on a shared drive</p>

<h2>Option 3</h2>

<p>Put your file in any directory you like</p>

<p>Add that directory to the PYTHONPATH environment variable</p>

<p>Proceed as with Option 1 or Option 2, except substitute the directory you just created for <code>&lt;Wherever your Python is&gt;/Lib/site-packages/</code></p>

<p>Pros: Keeps development code out of the site-packages directory</p>

<p>Cons: slightly more setup</p>

<p>This is the approach I usually use for development work</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>No one has mentioned using <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/site.html" rel="nofollow">.pth</a> files in site-packages to abstract away the location.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You will have to place your <code>MyLib.py</code> somewhere in your load path (this the paths in your <code>sys.path</code> variable) and then you'll be able to import it fine. Your code would look like</p>

<pre><code>import MyLib
MyLib.myfunc()
</code></pre>

<p>Generally speaking, you should distribute your packages using <a href="http://docs.python.org/distutils/index.html#distutils-index" rel="nofollow">distutils</a> so that they can be easily installed in the proper locations. It would help you as well. </p>

<p>Also, you might not want to install packages in your global Python install. It's customary (and recommended) to use <a href="http://iamzed.com/2009/05/07/a-primer-on-virtualenv/" rel="nofollow">virtualenv</a> which you can use to create small isolated Python environments that can hold local packages. </p>

<p>It's best your give the whole thing a shot and then ask further questions if you have them.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>The private version, from my <code>.profile</code></p>

<pre><code>export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:$HOME/lib/python
</code></pre>

<p>which has a subdirectory "msw" so <code>import msw.primes</code> is self documenting or add to a local directory that is already in <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/modules.html#the-module-search-path" rel="nofollow">sys.path</a></p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>The Python tutorial section 6 talks about modules, and 6.1.2 talks about the PYTHONPATH, which determines where Python will look for modules you try to import.
