<h3>Question (ID-1883118):</h3><h2>Big List Of Portability in Python</h2><p>I thought it would be a good idea to compile a list of things to watch out for when making a Python app portable. There are a lot of subtle 'gotchas' in portability that are only discovered through experience and thorough testing; there needs to be some sort of list addressing the more common ones.</p>

<p>Please post one gotcha (with its fix) per comment.</p>

It makes sure python code only gets <code>\n</code>:</p>

<pre><code>christophe@orion:~$ printf 'testing pep278\r\n' &gt; test.txt
christophe@orion:~$ python
Python 2.6.2 (release26-maint, Apr 19 2009, 01:56:41) 
[GCC 4.3.3] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; open('test.txt').read()
'testing pep278\r\n'
&gt;&gt;&gt; open('test.txt','U').read()
'testing pep278\n'
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Getting away from the syntax side of things, I think the biggest thing to watch out for is that typically when people think of python, they might not think of all the libraries it is composed of. </p>

<p>Many python packages depend on C libraries which may or may not be cross platform compatible. In addition, Python runs under Java through Jython, and .Net through IronPython. Unless libraries are written in pure python, they will not, in many cases, work on anything other than the C based version of python.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If you deal with binary file formats in Python, note that the <code>struct</code> and <code>array</code> modules uses machine dependent size and endianness. <code>struct</code> can be used portably by always using <code>&lt;</code> or <code>&gt;</code> in the format string. <code>array</code> can't. It will probably be portable for arrays of bytes, but the documentation makes no such guarantee.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Some modules are not cross-platform. Two that come to mind are both <code>curses</code> (Linux) and <code>msvcrt</code> (Windows). The fix to this simple problem is simply not to use them but find an alternative instead.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I'll start off:</p>

<p>Windows uses backslashes for path separators --> '\'</p>

<p>Unix uses forward slashes for path separators --> '/'</p>

<p>The os module comes with <code>os.sep</code>, which contains the path separator for the current platform that the script is being run on. Use <code>os.sep</code> instead of forward or back slashes. <code>os.path.join</code> will join two or more path components this way.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>There are subtle differences in UCS2  and UCS4 (Windows and Linux, for example) builds of Python due to bugs, conflicting or deprecated standards, etc.</p>

<h3>Example: <a href="http://bugs.python.org/issue3297" rel="nofollow">Issue 3297</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://bugs.python.org/file10880/unicodetest.py" rel="nofollow">unicodetest.py</a>:   </p>

<pre><code>#-*- coding: utf-8 -*-
print 'Result:', u'&#65827;' == u'\U00010123'
print 'Len:', len(u'&#65827;'), len(u'\U00010123')
print 'Repr:', repr(u'&#65827;'), repr(u'\U00010123')</code></pre>

<p>Output (Python 2.6, Linux):</p>

<pre><code>Result: False
Len: 2 1
Repr: u'\ud800\udd23' u'\U00010123'
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Unix vs. Windows:  Using <code>Popen</code> in the <code>subprocess</code> module will exhibit different behavior when <code>shell=True</code>.  I won't offer a fix because the discussion is covered so well <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1253122/why-does-subprocess-popen-with-shelltrue-work-differently-on-linux-vs-windows">here</a>, but it's one of those areas that can unexpectedly bite you.</p>
