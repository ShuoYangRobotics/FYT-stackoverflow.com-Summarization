<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Eclipse with Pydev</p>

<p>nothing better out there</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><a href="http://pytools.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">Pytools</a> should add intellisense for python to visual studio if you are developing on windows. I have not tried it myself so I don't know how good it works.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>well, many IDEs now come with pretty good code completion. Eclipse with pydev is nice, or you can get aptana studio 3 to perform similar to it.
Theres also jetbrain's PyCharm, if you don't mind paying for a licence (they do give a trial version too if you want to test it before buying). There are a lot of such IDEs, guess you have to try them out to see which suits your code completion tastes better.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>PyCharm for pay or Komodo Edit for free. </p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.activestate.com/komodo-ide" rel="nofollow">Komodo</a> has since long time an excellent Python support</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I have also been searching for a good IDE for Python development. I tried using Emacs and <a href="http://www.activestate.com/komodo-ide" rel="nofollow">Komodo</a> but finally settled for <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/" rel="nofollow">PyCharm</a>. It does a really good job at auto completing the code and I find it to be worth the money.</p>

<p>Depending on the type of development you do, you could get a discounted or even a free license.</p>
