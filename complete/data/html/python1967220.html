<h3>Question (ID-1967220):</h3><h2>Is there any Visual Studio-like tool for creating GUIs for Python?</h2><p>My girlfriend asked me if there was a tool (actually, an IDE) that would let her create her GUI visually and edit functions associated with GUI-related events with little effort.</p>

<p><strong>For example, she wants to double-click a button she just created and immediately see (and edit) the code associated with that button's on-click event. I believe this is what she does in Visual Studio.</strong></p>

<p>The toolkit doesn't matter. She just wants this funcionality.</p>

<p>Is there some tool that accomplishes this?</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>EDIT: Made the example look bold. Seemed no one was looking at it, and it's an important requirement.</p>

<p>As far as I know QtDesigner is integrated into some IDEs (e.g. <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/images/company/newsletter/qteclipse-designer/view" rel="nofollow">Eclipse</a>)</p>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.pythonxy.com" rel="nofollow">Python(x,y)</a> includes an installation of Eclipse with PyDev and QT Designer integrated. If you configure PyUIC to run from Eclipse (see <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/pythonxy/browse%5Fthread/thread/5297a34dccc2c2" rel="nofollow">this brief HOWTO</a>) then, once the GUI has been designed, the framework code can be generated at the push of a button.</p>

<p>Admittedly this is not as easy or as polished as VS and there may be problems when it comes to refactoring the GUI ...</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p><a href="http://wxglade.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">WxGlade</a>. I'm not sure if you can do the click and edit code thing, but it comes pretty close.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p><a href="http://qt.nokia.com/products/developer-tools" rel="nofollow">Qt Creator</a> is pretty slick. It's for C++ coding only, but Qt manages to make that a bit easier.</p>
