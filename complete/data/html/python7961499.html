<h3>Question (ID-7961499):</h3><h2>Best way to loop over python string backward</h2><p>What is the best way to loop over python string backward?</p>

<p>The following seems a little awkward for all the need of -1 offset:</p>

<pre><code>string = "trick or treat"
for i in range(len(string)-1, 0-1, -1):
    print string[i]
</code></pre>

<p>The following seems more succinct, but is it actually generate a reversed string so that there is a minor performance penalty?</p>

<pre><code>string = "trick or treat"
for c in string[::-1]:
    print c
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Try the <em><a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#reversed" rel="nofollow">reversed</a></em> builtin:</p>

<pre><code>for c in reversed(string):
     print c
</code></pre>

<p>The <em>reversed()</em> call will make an iterator rather than copying the entire string. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0322/" rel="nofollow">PEP 322</a> details the motivation for <em>reversed()</em> and its advantages over other approaches.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Yes, the second syntax shortcut creates an intermediate string and has an associated performance penalty. </p>

<p>The first version is better written as:</p>

<pre><code>for index, char in enumerate(reversed(s)):
   print "pos %d: %s" % (index, char)
</code></pre>

<p>Which is easy to comprehend. Neither <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#reversed" rel="nofollow"><code>reversed</code></a> nor <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#reversed" rel="nofollow"><code>enumerate</code></a>` need to make a copy of the string. </p>

<p>Also be careful about using <code>string</code> as a variable name, as it is also the name of <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/string.html" rel="nofollow">a module in the standard library</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><pre><code> string = "trick or treat"
 for c in string[::-1]:
     print c
</code></pre>

<p>I would use that. It is probably quite fast although there may be a slightly better way (but I doubt it).</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
Actually, with a second test using a program I hacked together, <code>reversed</code> is probably the way to go.</p>

<pre><code> ==== Results ====
Sample 1: 0.0225071907043 # Using a for loop
Sample 2: 0.0100858211517 # Using reversed
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Less code is usually faster in Python. Luckily, you don't have to guess:</p>

<pre><code>python -mtimeit -s"s='x'*100000" "for x in s[::-1]: pass"
100 loops, best of 3: 1.99 msec per loop

python -mtimeit -s"s='x'*100000" "for x in reversed(s): pass"
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.97 msec per loop

python -mtimeit -s"s='x'*100000" "for i in xrange(len(s)-1, 0-1, -1): s[i]"
100 loops, best of 3: 4.95 msec per loop
</code></pre>

<p>So the shorter code is a bit faster, but it comes with a memory overhead.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p><code>reversed</code> takes an iterable and and returns an iterator that moves backwards. <code>string[::-1]</code> is fine, but it creates a new, reversed string instead. If you just want to iterate, then this will probably better:</p>

<pre><code>for c in reversed(string):
    print c
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to use the reversed string afterwards, creating it once will be better.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><pre><code>string = "trick or treat"
for c in reversed(string):
    print c
</code></pre>

<p>Will do what I think you want. It uses an iterator. This should work with anything that has __reveresed__() or __len__() and __getitem__() implemented. __getitem__() would have to take int arguments starting at 0.</p>
