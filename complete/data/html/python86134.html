<h3>Question (ID-86134):</h3><h2>What are the pros and cons of the various Python implementations?</h2><p>I am relatively new to Python, and I have always used the standard cpython (v2.5) implementation.  </p>

<p>I've been wondering about the other implementations though, particularly Jython and IronPython.  What makes them better?  What makes them worse?  What other implementations are there?</p>

<p>I guess what I'm looking for is a summary and list of pros and cons for each implementation.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p><strong>Jython</strong> and <strong>IronPython</strong> are useful if you have an overriding need to interface with existing libraries written in a different platform, like if you have 100,000 lines of Java and you just want to write a 20-line Python script. Not particularly useful for anything else, in my opinion, because they are perpetually a few versions behind CPython due to community inertia.</p>

<p><strong>Stackless</strong> is interesting because it has support for green threads, continuations, etc. Sort of an Erlang-lite.</p>

<p><strong>PyPy</strong> is an experimental interpreter/compiler that may one day supplant CPython, but for now is more of a testbed for new ideas.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>An additional benefit for Jython, at least for some, is <a href="http://zyasoft.com/pythoneering/2008/06/realizing-jython-25.html" rel="nofollow">it lacks the GIL</a> (the Global Interpreter Lock) and uses Java's native threads.  This means that you can run pure Python code in parallel, something not possible with the GIL.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Pros: Access to the libraries available for JVM or CLR.</p>

<p>Cons: Both naturally lag behind CPython in terms of features.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>All of the implementations are listed here:</p>

<p>CPython is the "reference implementation" and developed by Guido and the core developers.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>IronPython and Jython use the runtime environment for .NET or Java and with that comes Just In Time compilation and a garbage collector different from the original CPython. They might be also faster than CPython thanks to the JIT, but I don't know that for sure.</p>

<p>A downside in using Jython or IronPython is that you cannot use native C modules, they can be only used in CPython.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p><a href="http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/home.html" rel="nofollow">PyPy</a> is a Python implementation written in RPython wich is a Python subset. </p>

<p>RPython can be translated to run on a VM or, unlike standard Python, RPython can be statically compiled.</p>
