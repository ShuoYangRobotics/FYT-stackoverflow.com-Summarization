<h3>Question (ID-2539116):</h3><h2>Python if statement efficiency</h2><p>A friend (fellow low skill level recreational python scripter) asked me to look over some code. I noticed that he had 7 separate statements that basically said.</p>

<pre><code>if ( a and b and c):
    do something
</code></pre>

<p>the statements a,b,c all tested their equality or lack of to set values. As I looked at it I found that because of the nature of the tests, I could re-write the whole logic block into 2 branches that never went more than 3 deep and rarely got past the first level (making the most rare occurrence test out first).</p>

<pre><code>if a:
    if b:
        if c:
    else:
        if c:
else:
    if b:
        if c:
    else:
        if c:
</code></pre>

<p>To me, logically it seems like it should be faster if you are making less, simpler tests that fail faster and move on.
My real questions are</p>

<p>1) When I say if and else, should the if be true, does the else get completely ignored? </p>

<p>2) In theory would</p>

<p>if (a and b and c)</p>

<p>take as much time as the three separate if statements would? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p><code>if</code> statements will skip everything in an <code>else</code> bracket if it evaluates to true. It should be noted that worrying about this sort of problem, unless it's done millions of times per program execution, is called "premature optimization" and should be avoided. If your code is clearer with three <code>if (a and b and c)</code> statements, they should be left in.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I would say the single test is as fast as the separate tests. Python also makes use of so called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-circuit_evaluation" rel="nofollow"><strong>short-circuit evaluation</strong></a>.</p>

<p>That means for <code>(a and b and c)</code>, that <code>b</code> or <code>c</code> would not be tested anymore if <code>a</code> is <code>false</code>.</p>

<p>Similar, if you have an <code>OR</code> expression <code>(a or b)</code> and <code>a</code> is <code>true</code>, <code>b</code> is never evaluated.</p>

<p>So to sum up, the clauses don't <em>fail faster</em> with separation.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Code:</p>

<pre><code>import dis

def foo():
  if ( a and b and c):
    pass
  else:
    pass

def bar():
  if a:
    if b:
      if c:
        pass

print 'foo():'
dis.dis(foo)
print 'bar():'
dis.dis(bar)
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>foo():

</code></pre>

<p>So, although the setup is the same, the cleanup for the combined expression is faster since it leaves only a single value on the stack.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>At least in python, efficiency is second to readability and "Flat is better than nested".</p>

<p>See <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/" rel="nofollow">The Zen of Python</a></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>If you are worried about b or c being functions that are called instead of just variables that are evaluated, then this code shows that short-circuiting is your friend:</p>

<pre><code>a = False
def b():
    print "b was called"
    return True

if a and b():
    print "this shouldn't happen"
else:
    print "if b was not called, then short-circuiting works"
</code></pre>

<p>prints</p>

<pre><code>if b was not called, then short-circuiting works
</code></pre>

<p>But if you have code that does this:</p>

<pre><code>a = call_to_expensive_function_A()
b = call_to_expensive_function_B()
c = call_to_expensive_function_C()

if a and b and c:
    do something...
</code></pre>

<p>then your code is still calling all 3 expensive functions.  Better to let Python be Python:</p>

<pre><code>if (call_to_expensive_function_A() and
    call_to_expensive_function_B() and
    call_to_expensive_function_C())
    do something...
</code></pre>

<p>which will only call as many expensive functions as necessary to determine the overall condition.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>You can generalize this using the <code>all</code> built-in:</p>

<pre><code># note, this is a list of the functions themselves
# the functions are *not* called when creating this list
funcs = [function_A, function_B, function_C]

if all(fn() for fn in funcs):
    do something
</code></pre>

<p>Now if you have to add other functions, or want to reorder them (maybe <code>function_A</code> is very time-consuming, and you would benefit by filtering cases that fail <code>function_B</code> or <code>function_C</code> first), you just update the <code>funcs</code> list.  <code>all</code> does short-circuiting just as if you had spelled out the if as <code>if a and b and c</code>.  (If functions are 'or'ed together, use <code>any</code> builtin instead.)</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I doubt you'd see a measurable difference so I'd recommend doing whatever makes the code most readable.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p><code>if (a and b and c)</code> will fail if <code>a</code> is falsy, and not bother checking <code>b</code> or <code>c</code>.</p>

<p>That said, I personally feel that nested conditionals are easier to read than 2^n combinations of conditionals.</p>

<p>In general, if you want to determine which way of doing something is fastest, you can write a simple benchmark using <a href="http://diveintopython.org/performance_tuning/timeit.html" rel="nofollow">timeit</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p><code>if (a and b and c)</code> is faster and better, for the sake of the "Real Programmer's code optimization" and code readability.</p>
