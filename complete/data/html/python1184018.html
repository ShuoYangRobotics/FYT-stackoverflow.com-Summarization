<h3>Question (ID-1184018):</h3><h2>Graduation Project</h2><p>I require to do a project as a part of my final year of engineering graduation studies.Can you suggest some projects pertaining to <strong>distributed systems</strong> and <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> together and which require <strong>python,c or c++</strong> for programming?
Note:-Please suggest a project that is attainable for a group of 2 students.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>How about a decision process that uses mapreduce, and gets more efficient at choosing the answer each time?</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>And what about participating in <a href="http://www.netflixprize.com/" rel="nofollow">NetFlix</a> competition?</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.ailab.si/orange/" rel="nofollow">Orange</a> is an comprehensive data mining and machine learing suite featuring Python scripting and visual programming. Maybe you too distributed it:)</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I need some kind of tool which observes the behaviour of a automation system (for instance a process control system), and is able to figure out on which inputs which actions follow, and then derives some kind of model from it which would then be usable as a simulation of the real system. It's not exactly distributed, but its engineering :-)</p>

<p>On the other hand, our code is written in java (although you could use jython instead).</p>

<p>If you are interested, drop me a mail (juergen DOT rose AT inavare DOT net).</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>If GO seems to complicated, you could also try a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five%5Fin%5Fa%5FRow%5F%28game%29" rel="nofollow">five in a row</a> computer opponent. (Wikipedia does this with GO-pieces, but I'm more used to the tic-tac-toe noughts and crosses.)</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>How about hacking a P2P protocol and implementing something useful? I worked on a proxy cache implementation for P2P traffic. Basically, design and implement a proxy cache for P2P traffic. It will be different from web documents/objects in that:</p>

<p>1- P2P objects are immutable. You might request a web-page more than once, but you really download a P2P object (e.g., movie) once and read it from your desk multiple times.</p>

<p>2- P2P objects are huge compared to web objects (up to few Gigabytes) so you'll need to cache some objects partially, and implement some kind of smart admission/eviction policy.</p>

<p>3- P2P objects have different popularity. Just because something is in the cache does not mean it should stay in the cache forever, because its popularity will degrade (i.e., once a movie is released it is very popular, downloaded a lot, then it drops and everybody forgets about it), so you can't rely on recency or frequency alone as the only replacement policy.</p>
