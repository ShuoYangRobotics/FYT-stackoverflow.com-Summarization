<h3>Question (ID-5904969):</h3><h2>Python: how to print a dictionary's key?</h2><p>I found a my question in SO already but it was not answered directly, but lead to another logic instead. I would like to print a specific python dictionary key:</p>

<pre><code>mydic = {}
mydic['key_name'] = 'value_name'
</code></pre>

<p>Now i can check if mydic.has_key('key_name') but what i would like to do is print the name of the key 'key_name'. Of course i could use mydic.items(), but i don't want <strong>all</strong> the keys listed, but merely one specific key. For instance i'd imagine a pseudo-code:</p>

<pre><code>print "the key name is", mydic['key_name'].name_the_key(), "and its value is", mydic['key_name']
</code></pre>

<p>Is there any name_the_key() method at all to print a key name?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
OK, thanks a lot guys for your reactions! :) I realise my question is not well formulated and trivial. I just got confused because i realised <code>key_name</code> and <code>mydic['key_name']</code> are two different things and i thought it would incorrect to print the <code>key_name</code> out of the dictionary context. But indeed i can simply use the 'key_name' to refer to the key! :)</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The name of the key 'key_name' is key_name, therefore <code>print 'key_name'</code> or whatever variable you have representing it.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>What's wrong with using <code>'key_name'</code> instead, even if it is a variable?</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Hmm, I think that what you might be wanting to do is print <strong>all</strong> the keys in the dictionary and their respective values?</p>

<p>If so you want the following:</p>

<pre><code>for key in mydic.keys():
  print "the key name is" + key + "and its value is" + mydic[key]
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure you use +'s instead of ,' as well. The comma will put each of those items on a separate line I think, where as plus will put them on the same line.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>A dictionary has, by definition, an arbitrary number of keys. There is no "the key". You have the <code>keys()</code> method, which gives you a python <code>list</code> of all the keys, and you have the <code>iteritems()</code> method, which returns key-value pairs, so</p>

<pre><code>for key, value in mydic.iteritems() :
    print key, value
</code></pre>

<p>So you have a handle on the keys, but they only really mean sense if coupled to a value. I hope I have understood your question.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Try this:</p>

<pre><code>def name_the_key(dict, key):
    return key, dict[key]

mydict = {'key1':1, 'key2':2, 'key3':3}

key_name, value = name_the_key(mydict, 'key2')
print 'KEY NAME: %s' % key_name
print 'KEY VALUE: %s' % value
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Since we're all trying to guess what "print a key name" might mean, I'll take a stab at it.  Perhaps you want a function that takes a value from the dictionary and finds the corresponding key?  A reverse lookup?</p>

<pre><code>def key_for_value(d, value):
    """Return a key in `d` having a value of `value`."""
    for k, v in d.iteritems():
        if v == value:
            return k
</code></pre>

<p>Note that many keys could have the same value, so this function will return <em>some</em> key having the value, perhaps not the one you intended.</p>

<p>If you need to do this frequently, it would make sense to construct the reverse dictionary:</p>

<pre><code>d_rev = dict(v,k for k,v in d.iteritems())
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><pre><code>import pprint
pprint.pprint(mydic.keys())
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><pre><code>key_name = '...'
print "the key name is %s and its value is %s"%(key_name, mydic[key_name])
</code></pre>
