<h3>Question (ID-3089450):</h3><h2>How to use python on webserver for web pages</h2><p>I have  read in the documentation that there are 4 or 5 ways in which i can python for web pages. Like</p>

<ol>
<li>With CGI</li>
<li>Mod_python : mod_python does have some problems. Unlike the PHP interpreter, the Python interpreter uses caching when executing files, so changes to a file will require the web server to be restarted</li>
<li>FastCGI and SCGI</li>
<li>mod_wsgi</li>
</ol>

<p>SO which way should i go . does it means that python is not for webistes if there are too many problems while using it</p>

<p>I have to build the live business website with thousands of users so i should not use it if that has many probelms</p>

<p>mod_wsgi is mentioned as a replacement.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I am a big fan of <a href="http://www.cherrypy.org/" rel="nofollow">cherrypy</a>.  Yes there are a lot of choices out there.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You could also use Google App Engine with Python and Django</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Personally I use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface" rel="nofollow">CGI</a> or the Python <a href="http://file:///usr/share/doc/python-doc/html/library/internet.html" rel="nofollow"><code>*HTTPServer</code></a> modules. CGI is very easy and seems a reasonable "unixy" approach. The <code>*HTTPServer</code> modules are minimal, and easy to extend if you're familiar with HTTP.</p>

<p>I've heard very good things about <a href="http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/" rel="nofollow">mod_wsgi</a>, and hope to learn to use it sometime. My vote then is that you go with mod_wsgi, it's not even specific to just Python.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>The important thing is that whatever you use to develop your Python web application, that it support the WSGI (<a href="http://www.wsgi.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.wsgi.org</a>) interface for hosting. So long as you do that, it can be hosted with any of options 1-4, albeit that CGI/WSGI bridge would only be used for small scripts and not large frameworks because of fact that new process has to be created for each request.</p>

<p>So, don't worry about the hosting mechanism as many exist and not just those above. Instead, start looking at the various framework and toolkits available. The most mainstream of these for Python is Django (<a href="http://www.djangoproject.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.djangoproject.com</a>).</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I think those problems are not strong enough to say Python is not for websites. And Python syntax is very clear and easy read. You should try <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/" rel="nofollow">Django</a> for web development. It can reali speed up your development process.</p>
