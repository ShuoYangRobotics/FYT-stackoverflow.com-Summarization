<h3>Question (ID-1605854):</h3><h2>What is the best artificial-intelligence library for Python?</h2><p>I know of NLTK. What else is there that complements this library? Or can do AI?</p>

<p>NLTK is great because I can learn it with the book that it came out.
Is there a library for AI just like this?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Have a look at the <a href="http://mloss.org/software/" rel="nofollow">mloss list</a>, it contains many Python libraries.</p>

<p>Out of self-interest (being one of the maintainers) I would like to point out the <a href="http://mdp-toolkit.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">Modular Toolkit for Data Processing (MDP)</a> library, which includes some algorithms like Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and can be used for hierarchical networks. There is also some support for Support Vector Machines (SVM).</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The <a href="http://scikit-learn.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">scikit-learn</a> package has a lot of algorithms to solve machine learning problems in Python, both in supervised learning (regression, classification, outliers detections) and unsupervised learning (decompositions such as ICA, or clustering methods).</p>

<p>It is BSD licensed and depends only on scipy and numpy. Also, it has a focus on performance. For instance, for SVM (support vector machines) it uses the C library libsvm, but with specially-crafted bindings that are faster than the libsvm Python binding ( <a href="http://fseoane.net/blog/2010/fast-bindings-for-libsvm-in-scikitslearn/" rel="nofollow">http://fseoane.net/blog/2010/fast-bindings-for-libsvm-in-scikitslearn/</a> ).</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Since you seem to be interested in a book/code combination, you could try Stephen Marsland's <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1420067184" rel="nofollow">Machine Learning</a> book. He has associated Python code available on <a href="http://seat.massey.ac.nz/personal/s.r.marsland/MLBook.html" rel="nofollow">his website</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Have you read the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine%5Flearning" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia entry on machine learning</a>? As I've said, it is a very broad topic. It consists of these subjects (among others):</p>

<ul>
<li>Neural networks</li>
<li>Expert Systems</li>
<li>Genetic Algorithms</li>
<li>Fuzzy Logic</li>
</ul>

<p>And all of them are different in the way they work, their purpose and what they're useful for.</p>

<p>But to answer your question, you can look at the <a href="http://leenissen.dk/fann/" rel="nofollow">Fast Artificial Neural Network Library</a>, which I've used before and has Python bindings.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Late to the game on this one, but the company I work for, Visual Numerics, provides a number of routines in the AI area (e.g. neural networks, naive bayes classifiers, genetic algorithms...). The product we have is called <a href="http://www.vni.com/campaigns/pyimslstudioeval/" rel="nofollow">PyIMSL Studio</a> and its free for noncommercial or educational use. The key component is Python wrappers to hundreds of mathematical and statistical functions in the IMSL C Numerical Library. You can use our full Python distribution (which includes the usual packages like numpy and matplotlib), or just install our math/stat package into your existing Python area. Hope it helps!</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>AI is a massive, massive field with many subtopics. For instance, I work with computer vision, which is considered a subtopic of AI. The major Python library in this field is OpenCV.</p>
