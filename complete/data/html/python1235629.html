<h3>Question (ID-1235629):</h3><h2>Execute python code inside browser without Jython</h2><p>Is there a way to execute python code in a browser, other than using Jython and an applet?</p>

<p>The execution does not have to deal with anything related to graphics. For example, just sum all the digits of a binary 1Gb file (chosen by the browser user) and then return the result to the server.</p>

<p>I am aware that <a href="http://pyro.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">python can be executed remotely</a> outside a browser, but my requirement is to be done inside a browser.</p>

<p>For sure, I take for granted the user will keep the right to execute or not, and will be asked to do so, and all this security stuff... but that is not my question.</p>

<p>Modern browsers only run javascript or plugins. You can develop your own python plugin and convince people to download and run it, but I guess that falls to the "not inside the browser" category.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The <a href="http://pyjs.org/" rel="nofollow">Pyjamas</a> project has a compiler called pyjs which turns Python code into Javascript.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You mean client-side?</p>

<p><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=fzUCGtyg0MMC&amp;pg=PA437&amp;lpg=PA437&amp;dq=python+client+side+script+internet+explorer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Y221r-y9yw&amp;sig=GZtEidkb3N5KypJBvyaBOKOvsHE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=pvB5SpSqH5-Ntgfag92WCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book%5Fresult&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3#v=onepage&amp;q=python%20client%20side%20script%20internet%20explorer&amp;f=false" rel="nofollow" title="Python programming on Win32 By Mark Hammond, Andy Robinson">Sure you can</a>! But you need to have python installed on the client first.</p>

<p>The linked book describes that in order to use client-side Active Scripting, you can test it with the a simple <code>html</code> file.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;
&lt;script language='Python'&gt;alert("Hello, Python!")&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In the old version refered in that book (Python programming on Win32
 By Mark Hammond, Andy Robinson)
it says that you need to install the <a href="http://python.net/crew/mhammond/win32/Downloads.html" rel="nofollow">Python Win32 extensions</a>, and it will automatically register Python Active Scripting. Should you do it manually, you have to run the script <code>python\win32comext\axscript\client\pyscript.py</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>nosklo's answer is wrong: pyxpcomext for firefox adds language="python" support to script tags.  yes it's a whopping 10mb plugin, but that's life.  i think it's best if you refer to <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/WebBrowserProgramming" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.python.org/moin/WebBrowserProgramming</a> because that is where all known documented links between python and web browser technology are recorded: you can take your pick, there.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.skulpt.org/" rel="nofollow">Yes</a></p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>By accident I was listening to <a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?ShowID=191" rel="nofollow"> Hanselminutes </a> where he mentioned about Gestalt project. This is a solution to integrate a languages as IronRuby and IronPython in browser via Silverlight.</p>

<p>So I think the answer is no if you don't have any special plugins.</p>
