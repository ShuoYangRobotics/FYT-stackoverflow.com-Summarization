<h3>Question (ID-6317287):</h3><h2>List index out of range</h2><p>I have written a program that makes sure each cookie has more than 5 chips before moving on.
However, the line <code>if cookie[i] &gt; 5:</code> seems to be problematic, as it produces a "list index out of range" error. I thought <code>foo = []</code> created a list with no ending, so I don't get why <em>any</em> number would be out of range in this list. What am I doing wrong?</p>

<pre><code>cookie = []

...

for i in range(0, 11):
    if cookie[i] &gt; 5:
         break
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Try:</p>

<pre><code>len(cookie)
</code></pre>

<p>You'll see if you haven't put anything in it that it'll be size 0. With <code>cookie = []</code> you can continuously add elements to the list but it's initialized empty.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><code>cookie = []</code> creates empty list with no data, so no indexes here.  You need to fill <code>cookie</code> with some data first (e.g. using <code>cookie.append(some_data)</code>).</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>How about:</p>

<pre><code>cookies = []

...

for cookie in cookies:
    if cookie &gt; 5:
         break
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You can't really have a list with no ending that in your case presumably has only zeros in it.</p>

<p>You can however create a list with  11  zeros:</p>

<pre><code>cookies = [0] * 11
</code></pre>

<p>Or create something that returns <code>0</code> if you access it at an index if you haven't put anything else in there:</p>

<pre><code>import collections
cookies = collections.defaultdict(int)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this is not a list but a map.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p><code>foo = []</code> creates an <em>empty</em> list, not a list with no ending. Any index access will fail on an empty list. To check the length of a list, use <code>len(mylist)</code>. The length of an empty list is 0, and indices are zero-based. So:</p>

<pre><code>cookie = []
len(cookie) == 0
cookie[0] ## will raise IndexError

cookie.append('something')
len(cookie) == 1
cookie[0] ## will return 'something'
</code></pre>

<p>See the <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists" rel="nofollow">list docs</a></p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p><code>foo=[]</code> does not create a list with no ending.  Instead, it creates an empty list.</p>

<p>You could do</p>

<pre><code>for i in range(0, len(foo)):
    if(cookie[i]&gt;5):
        break
</code></pre>

<p>Or you could do</p>

<pre><code>for c in cookie:
    if c&gt;5:
        break
</code></pre>
