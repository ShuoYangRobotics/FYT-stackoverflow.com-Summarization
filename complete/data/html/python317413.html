<h3>Question (ID-317413):</h3><h2>Get Element value with minidom, Python</h2><p>I am creating a GUI frontend for the Eve Online API in Python.</p>

<p>I have successfully pulled the XML data from their server.</p>

<p>I am trying to grab the value from a node called "name"</p>

<pre><code>from xml.dom.minidom import parse
dom = parse("C:\\eve.xml")
name = dom.getElementsByTagName('name')
print name
</code></pre>

<p>This seems to find the node ok but the output is below:</p>

<pre><code>[&lt;DOM Element: name at 0x11e6d28&gt;]
</code></pre>

<p>How could I get it to print the value of the node?</p>

<p>Cheers</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Probably something like this if it's the text part you want...</p>

<pre><code>from xml.dom.minidom import parse
dom = parse("C:\\eve.xml")
name = dom.getElementsByTagName('name')

print " ".join(t.nodeValue for t in name[0].childNodes if t.nodeType == t.TEXT_NODE)
</code></pre>

<p>The text part of a node is considered a node in itself placed as a child-node of the one you asked for. Thus you will want to go through all its children and find all child nodes that are text nodes. A node can have several text nodes; eg.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;name&gt;
  blabla
  &lt;somestuff&gt;asdf&lt;/somestuff&gt;
  znylpx
&lt;/name&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You want both 'blabla' and 'znylpx'; hence the " ".join(). You might want to replace the space with a newline or so, or perhaps by nothing.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>It should just be</p>

<pre><code>name[0].nodeValue
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>you can use something like this.It worked out for me</p>

<pre><code>doc = parse('C:\\eve.xml')
my_node_list = doc.getElementsByTagName("name")
my_n_node = my_node_list[0]
my_child = my_n_node.firstChild
my_text = my_child.data 
print my_text
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I know this question is pretty old now, but I thought you might have an easier time with ElementTree</p>

<pre><code>from xml.etree import ElementTree as ET
import datetime

f = ET.XML(data)

for element in f:
    if element.tag == "currentTime":
        # Handle time data was pulled
        currentTime = datetime.datetime.strptime(element.text, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
    if element.tag == "cachedUntil":
        # Handle time until next allowed update
        cachedUntil = datetime.datetime.strptime(element.text, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
    if element.tag == "result":
        # Process list of skills
        pass
</code></pre>

<p>I know that's not super specific, but I just discovered it, and so far it's a lot easier to get my head around than the minidom (since so many nodes are essentially white space).</p>

<p>For instance, you have the tag name and the actual text together, just as you'd probably expect:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; element[0]
&lt;Element currentTime at 40984d0&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; element[0].tag
'currentTime'
&gt;&gt;&gt; element[0].text
'2010-04-12 02:45:45'e
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I had a similar case, what worked for me was:</p>

<p>name.firstChild.childNodes[0].data</p>

<p>XML is supposed to be simple and it really is and I don't know why python's minidom did it so complicated... but it's how it's made</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Here is a slightly modified answer of Henrik's for multiple nodes (ie. when getElementsByTagName returns more than one instance)</p>

<pre><code>images = xml.getElementsByTagName("imageUrl")
for i in images:
    print " ".join(t.nodeValue for t in i.childNodes if t.nodeType == t.TEXT_NODE)
</code></pre>
