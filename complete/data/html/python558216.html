<h3>Question (ID-558216):</h3><h2>Plese help me write a function to determine if two numbers are nearly equal when rounded to n significant decimal digits</h2><p>I have been asked to test a library provided by a 3rd party. The library is known to be accurate to n significant figures. Any less significant errors can safely be ignored. I want to write a function to help me compare the results:</p>

<pre><code>def nearlyequal( a, b, sigfig=5 ):
</code></pre>

<p>The purpose of this function is to determine if two floating-point numbers (a and b) are approximately equal. The function will return True if a==b (exact match) or if a and b have the same value when rounded to <strong>sigfig</strong> significant-figures when written decimal. </p>

<p>Can anybody suggest a good implementation, I've written a mini unit-test. Unless you can see a bug in my tests then a good implementation should be pass the following:</p>

<pre><code>assert nearlyequal(1, 1, 5) 
assert nearlyequal(1.0, 1.0, 5) 
assert nearlyequal(1.0, 1.0, 5) 
assert nearlyequal(-1e-9, 1e-9, 5) 
assert nearlyequal(1e9, 1e9 + 1 , 5) 
assert not nearlyequal( 1e4, 1e4 + 1, 5) 
assert nearlyequal( 0.0, 1e-15, 5 ) 
assert not nearlyequal( 0.0, 1e-4, 6 )
</code></pre>

<p>Additional notes:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Values a and b might be of type int, float or numpy.float64. Values a and b will always be of the same type. It's vital that conversion does not introduce additional error into the function.</p></li>
<li><p>Lets keep this numerical, so functions that convert to strings or use non-mathematical tricks are not ideal. This program will be audited by somebody who is a mathematician who will want to be able to prove that the function does what it is supposed to do.</p></li>
<li><p>Speed... I've got to compare a lot of numbers so the faster the better.</p></li>
<li><p>I've got numpy, scypy and the standard-library. Anything else will be hard for me to get, especially for such a small part of the project.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; help(assert_approx_equal) Help on function assert_approx_equal in module numpy.testing.utils:

assert_approx_equal(actual, desired, significant=7, err_msg='', verbose=True)
    Raise an assertion if two items are not
    equal.  I think this should be part of unittest.py
    Approximately equal is defined as the number of significant digits

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Here's a take.</p>

<pre><code>def nearly_equal(a,b,sig_fig=5):
    return ( a==b or 
             int(a*10**sig_fig) == int(b*10**sig_fig)
           )
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>"Significant figures" in decimal is a matter of adjusting the decimal point and truncating to an integer.  </p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; int(3.1415926 * 10**3)
3141
&gt;&gt;&gt; int(1234567 * 10**-3)
1234
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I believe your question is not enough well defined, and the unit-tests you present prove it:</p>

<p>If by 'round to N sig-fig decimal places' you mean 'N decimal places to the right of the decimal point', then the test "assert nearlyequal(1e9, 1e9 + 1 , 5)" should fail because even when you round 1000000000 and 1000000001 to 0.00001 accuracy, they are still different.</p>

<p>And if y 'round to N sig-fig decimal places' you mean 'The N most significant digits, regardless of the decimal point', then the test "assert nearlyequal(-1e-9, 1e-9, 5)" should fail, because 0.000000001 and -0.000000001 are totally different when viewed this way.</p>

<p>If you meant the first definition, then the first answer on this page (by Triptych) is good.
If you meant the second definition, please say it, I promise to think about it :-)</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I would actually say:</p>

<pre><code>def nearlyequal( a, b, sigfig=5 ):
    return round(a, sigfig) == round(b, sigfig)
</code></pre>

<p>as the methods above using <code>int()</code> always round down (ie. <code>int(0.9)</code> goes to <code>0</code>).</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: This is horribly wrong. I just wanted to make the point that int rounds down.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>This is a fairly common issue with floating point numbers. I solve it based on the discussion in Section 1.5 of Demmel[1]. (1) Calculate the roundoff error. (2) Check that the roundoff error is less than some epsilon. I haven't used python in some time and only have version 2.4.3, but I'll try to get this correct.</p>

<p>Step 1. Roundoff error</p>

<pre><code>def roundoff_error(exact, approximate):
    return abs(approximate/exact - 1.0)
</code></pre>

<p>Step 2. Floating point equality</p>

<pre><code>def float_equal(float1, float2, epsilon=2.0e-9):
    return (roundoff_error(float1, float2) &lt; epsilon)
</code></pre>

<p>There are a couple obvious deficiencies with this code.</p>

<ol>
<li>Division by zero error if the exact value is Zero.</li>
<li>Does not verify that the arguments are floating point values.</li>
</ol>

<p>Revision 1.</p>

<pre><code>def roundoff_error(exact, approximate):
    if (exact == 0.0 or approximate == 0.0):
        return abs(exact + approximate)
    else:
        return abs(approximate/exact - 1.0)

def float_equal(float1, float2, epsilon=2.0e-9):
    if not isinstance(float1,float):
        raise TypeError,"First argument is not a float."
    elif not isinstance(float2,float):
        raise TypeError,"Second argument is not a float."
    else:
        return (roundoff_error(float1, float2) &lt; epsilon)
</code></pre>

<p>That's a little better. If either the exact or the approximate value is zero, than the error is equal to the value of the other. If something besides a floating point value is provided, a TypeError is raised.</p>

<p>At this point, the only difficult thing is setting the correct value for epsilon. I noticed in the documentation for version 2.6.1 that there is an epsilon attribute in sys.float_info, so I would use twice that value as the default epsilon. But the correct value depends on both your application and your algorithm.</p>

<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Oren Shemesh got part of the problem with the problem as stated but there's more:</p>

<p>assert nearlyequal( 0.0, 1e-15, 5 ) </p>

<p>also fails the second definition (and that's the definition I learned in school.)</p>

<p>No matter how many digits you are looking at, 0 will not equal a not-zero.  This could prove to be a headache for such tests if you have a case whose correct answer is zero.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>There are already plenty of great answers, but here's a think:</p>

<pre><code>def closeness(a, b):
  """Returns measure of equality (for two floats), in unit
     of decimal significant figures."""
  if a == b:
    return float("infinity")
  difference = abs(a - b)
  avg = (a + b)/2
  return math.log10( avg / difference )


if closeness(1000, 1000.1) &gt; 3:
  print "Joy!"

<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>There is a interesting solution to this by B. Dawson (with C++ code)
at <a href="http://www.cygnus-software.com/papers/comparingfloats/comparingfloats.htm" rel="nofollow">"Comparing Floating Point Numbers"</a>.  His approach relies on strict IEEE representation of two numbers and the enforced lexicographical ordering when said numbers are represented as unsigned integers.</p>
