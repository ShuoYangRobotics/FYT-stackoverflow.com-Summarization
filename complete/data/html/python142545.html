<h3>Question (ID-142545):</h3><h2>Python: How to make a cross-module variable?</h2><p>The <code>__debug__</code> variable is handy in part because it affects every module. If I want to create another variable that works the same way, how would I do it?</p>

<p>The variable (let's be original and call it 'foo') doesn't have to be truly global, in the sense that if I change foo in one module, it is updated in others. I'd be fine if I could set foo before importing other modules and then they would see the same value for it.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>If you need a global cross-module variable maybe just simple global module-level variable will suffice. </p>

<p>a.py:</p>

<pre><code>var = 1
</code></pre>

<p>b.py:</p>

<pre><code>import a
print a.var
import c
print a.var
</code></pre>

<p>c.py:</p>

<pre><code>import a
a.var = 2
</code></pre>

<p>Test:</p>

<pre><code>$ python b.py
# -&gt; 1 2
</code></pre>

<p>Real-world example: <a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/browser/djangoproject.com/django_website/settings.py" rel="nofollow">Django's settings.py</a> (though in Django apps settings are used by importing the <em>object</em> <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/settings/#using-settings-in-python-code" rel="nofollow"><code>django.conf.settings</code></a>).</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I don't endorse this solution in any way, shape or form.  But if you add a variable to the <code>__builtin__</code> module, it will be accessible as if a global from any other module that includes <code>__builtin__</code> -- which is all of them, by default.</p>

<p>a.py contains</p>

<pre><code>print foo
</code></pre>

<p>b.py contains</p>

<pre><code>import __builtin__
__builtin__.foo = 1
import a
</code></pre>

<p>The result is that "1" is printed.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> The <code>__builtin__</code> module is available as the local symbol <code>__builtins__</code> -- that's the reason for the discrepancy between two of these answers. Also note that <code>__builtin__</code> has been renamed to <code>builtins</code> in python3.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Define a module ( call it "globalbaz" ) and have the variables defined inside it. All the modules using this "pseudoglobal" should import the "globalbaz" module, and refer to it using "globalbaz.var_name"</p>

<p>This works regardless of the place of the change, you can change the variable before or after the import. The imported module will use the latest value. (I tested this in a toy example)</p>

<p>For clarification, globalbaz.py looks just like this:</p>

<pre><code>var_name = "my_useful_string"
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Global variables are usually a bad idea, but you can do this by assigning to <code>__builtins__</code>:</p>

<pre><code>__builtins__.foo = 'something'
print foo
</code></pre>

<p>Also, modules themselves are variables that you can access from any module.  So if you define a module called <code>my_globals.py</code>:</p>

<pre><code># my_globals.py
foo = 'something'
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can use that from anywhere as well:</p>

<pre><code>import my_globals
print my_globals.foo
</code></pre>

<p>Using modules rather than modifying <code>__builtins__</code> is generally a cleaner way to do globals of this sort.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You can pass the globals of one module to onother:</p>

<p>In Module A:</p>

<pre><code>import module_b
my_var=2
module_b.do_something_with_my_globals(globals())
print my_var
</code></pre>

<p>In Module B:</p>

<pre><code>def do_something_with_my_globals(glob): # glob is simply a dict.
    glob["my_var"]=3
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>This sounds like modifying the <code>__builtin__</code> name space.  To do it:</p>

<pre><code>import __builtin__
__builtin__.foo = 'some-value'
</code></pre>

<p>Do not use the <code>__builtins__</code> directly (notice the extra "s") - apparently this can be a dictionary or a module.  Thanks to ΤΖΩΤΖΙΟΥ for pointing this out, more can be found <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.python/browse_thread/thread/1907d5e660444c08/69c29c4ec0c4d3ec" rel="nofollow" title="here">here</a>.</p>

<p>Now <code>foo</code> is available for use everywhere.</p>

<p>I don't recommend doing this generally, but the use of this is up to the programmer.</p>

<p>Assigning to it must be done as above, just setting <code>foo = 'some-other-value'</code> will only set it in the current namespace.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>You can already do this with module-level variables.  Modules are the same no matter what module they're being imported from.  So you can make the variable a module-level variable in whatever module it makes sense to put it in, and access it or assign to it from other modules.  It would be better to call a function to set the variable's value, or to make it a property of some singleton object.  That way if you end up needing to run some code when the variable's changed, you can do so without breaking your module's external interface.</p>

<p>It's not usually a great way to do things — using globals seldom is — but I think this is the cleanest way to do it.  </p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Okay, turning this on it's head, why do you want a global variable? ..or in other words, there are probably better ways of achieving the solution you're after if you can explain exactly what you want?</p>
