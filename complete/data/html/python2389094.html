<h3>Question (ID-2389094):</h3><h2>Python list entries are overridden by last appended entry</h2><p>I've got this code:</p>

<pre><code>def __parse(self):        
    for line in self.lines:
        r = Record(line)
        self.records[len(self.records):] = [r]
        print self.records[len(self.records)-1].getValue() # Works fine!
    print self.record[0].getValue() # Gives the same as
    print self.record[1].getValue() # as
    # ... and so on ...
    print self.record[len(self.record)-1].getValue()
</code></pre>

<p>Now what it should do is making records out of lines of text. But when I access those list after the for-loop has completed all records give the same results for methods I call on them. When I access a record within the for-loop right after it was appended it's the right one so the Record <strong>init</strong> can't be fault. No, it's absolutely sure that the lines I put in are different! Has anyone an idea why this happens? Help would be very appreciated! </p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You aren't appending to <code>self.records</code>; you are always overwriting it.</p>

<p>Use:</p>

<p><code>self.records.append(r)</code> </p>

<p>instead.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Never mind.  See Ignacio Vasquez-Abrams's comment.  I would delete this answer if not for that.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Does it still happen if you replace it with the following:</p>

<pre><code>self.record = [Record(l) for l in self.lines]
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>Something <em>must</em> be wrong in <code>Record</code> since the code there does work, even if it makes experienced coders weep when they read it.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Ahue, you have mutable objects in the <em>shared</em> class namespace -- a very common misconception when starting out with python.  Move the initialization of <code>records = []</code> in <code>CsvSet</code> into its <code>__init__</code> function, and move <code>record = {}</code> into <code>Record</code> <code>__init__</code> function.  Should look like the following:</p>

<pre><code>class Record:
    def __init__(self,lines):
        self.record = {}
        self.__parse()

class CsvSet:
    def __init__(self,lines):
        self.records = []
        self.__parse()
</code></pre>

<p>When you declare a mutable variable in the class area, it is shared among all instances of those classses, not created for each instance.   By moving the initialization into an instance method (<code>__init__</code> in this case), you are creating new mutable stores for each instance, which is what you intended.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Record class is broken. You use a class variable (Record.record) instead of an instance attribute. Class variable is one for all instances and you want different <code>self.record</code> for each instance.</p>

<p>Move the:</p>

<pre><code>record = {}
line = ""
</code></pre>

<p>lines into the constructor (indented under <code>def __init__(self,line):</code>)</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>The Record class is broken, you are always returning the same object.</p>

<p>Without seeing the code for Record it's impossible to guess</p>

<p>Perhaps you are using a list or a dict as default parameter to <code>__init__</code> and returning that with <code>getValue()</code>.</p>

<p>Another possibility is that <code>getValue()</code> is returning a class attribute rather than an instance attribute</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Ok, so I'll post the code for the Record class for clarification, too.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>class Record:</p>

<pre><code>record = {}
line = ""

def __init__(self,line):
    self.line = line 
    self.__parse()

def __parse(self):
    fieldnames = ['from','to','value','error']
    fields = self.line.split(',')

    c = 0
    for field in fields:
        self.record[fieldnames[c]] = field.strip()
        c+=1

    self.record['from'] = datetime.datetime.strptime(self.record['from'],"%Y-%m-%d")
    self.record['to'] = datetime.datetime.strptime(self.record['to'],"%Y-%m-%d")
</code></pre>
  
  <p>class CsvSet:</p>

<pre><code>records = []

def __init__(self,lines):
    self.__parse()

def __parse(self):        
    for line in self.lines:
        self.records.append(Record(line))
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The __parse method in CsvSet is now how it was in the beginning. I changed if for debugging reasons but the result is the same. And Ignacio you're right, I startet with Python only 2 weeks ago...</p>
