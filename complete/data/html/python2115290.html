<h3>Question (ID-2115290):</h3><h2>Index xml files from a outside website</h2><p>Using python django I would like to access this site <a href="http://www.reta-vortaro.de/revo/" rel="nofollow">http://www.reta-vortaro.de/revo/</a>    It is a dictionary site for a language called esperanto,  I need to be able to search for a word, and get back its definition, it looks like Each Esperanto root word has an xml file, </p>

<ol>
<li>I need to index each xml file</li>
<li>store the name of each xml file in a database.</li>
<li>On my website I need to $_GET the word.</li>
<li>I need to search for combinations of these root words with a xml file named after it.</li>
</ol>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Wonder, if you have access to WSDL. You might be able to access the data that way.
What exactly is the problem you are encountering?</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>As soon as you need indexing and fast search, it might worth looking for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_database" rel="nofollow">XML database</a> for storing your dictionary (especially for complex queries and big dictionaries). You can easily access most XML databases from PHP.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I would consider such workflow for you:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download all the files</li>
<li>Load their contents and filenames into database (any database will fit) </li>
<li>Setup sphinx search tool ( <a href="http://sphinx.pocoo.org/" rel="nofollow">http://sphinx.pocoo.org/</a> )</li>
<li>Run sphinx to build an index for xml_contents</li>
<li>Design your application to use sphinx for search in index</li>
<li>Delete all file contains, leaving only filename and sphinx index in a database</li>
<li>When using sphinx search, you'll get a filename, operate with it as you supposed before</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm not very familiar with sphinx and don't know is it capable to use files, to build it's index, that why I offer you to load all the information into database</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Have you tried asking the site's administrator for the data? Or perhaps he could set up a web service for you?</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Well, you can fetch each XML file with <code>file_get_contents()</code>, curl, wget or the tool that pleases you the most.</p>

<p>Then, You can save the XML files on the file system, or even better use Oracle's Berkeley <a href="http://www.oracle.com/database/berkeley-db/xml/index.html" rel="nofollow">DBXML</a>, with it you can actually save the XML in the Database and query it, kinda like if it was SQL. It has PHP bindings and lets you query with XQuery. I used it to replace a XML web service and works like a charm, blazing fast.</p>

<p>For PHP XML parsing I used to use <a href="http://keithdevens.com/software/phpxml" rel="nofollow">Keith Devens' XML to Array</a> parser, which is EASY, but it's now oldish Now I use CakePHP's own, you may want to use PHP's <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.simplexml.php" rel="nofollow">SimpleXML</a>. There are also JavaScript based parsers you could use on the client side of the app like <a href="http://jparse.kylerush.net/" rel="nofollow">jParse</a> (jQuery).</p>

<p>This is the Page for PHP + dbXML but seems to be down: <a href="http://phpdbxml.4641.org/" rel="nofollow">http://phpdbxml.4641.org/</a> but you can download it from here: <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/products/berkeley-db/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/products/berkeley-db/index.html</a> (there's the license too).</p>

<p>I hope it helps.</p>
