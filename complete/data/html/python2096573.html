<h3>Question (ID-2096573):</h3><h2>counting combinations and permutations efficiently</h2><p>I have some code to count permutations and combinations, and I'm trying to make it work better for large numbers.</p>

<p>I've found a better algorithm for permutations that avoids large intermediate results, but I still think I can do better for combinations.</p>

<p>So far, I've put in a special case to reflect the symmetry of nCr, but I'd still like to find a better algorithm that avoids the call to factorial(r), which is an unnecessarily large intermediate result. Without this optimization, the last doctest takes too long trying to calculate factorial(99000).</p>

<p>Can anyone suggest a more efficient way to count combinations?</p>

<pre><code>from math import factorial

def product(iterable):
    prod = 1
    for n in iterable:
        prod *= n
    return prod

def npr(n, r):
    """
    Calculate the number of ordered permutations of r items taken from a
    population of size n.

    &gt;&gt;&gt; npr(3, 2)
    6
    &gt;&gt;&gt; npr(100, 20)
    1303995018204712451095685346159820800000
    """
    assert 0 &lt;= r &lt;= n
    return product(range(n - r + 1, n + 1))

def ncr(n, r):
    """
    Calculate the number of unordered combinations of r items taken from a
    population of size n.

    &gt;&gt;&gt; ncr(3, 2)
    3
    &gt;&gt;&gt; ncr(100, 20)
    535983370403809682970
    &gt;&gt;&gt; ncr(100000, 1000) == ncr(100000, 99000)
    True
    """
    assert 0 &lt;= r &lt;= n
    if r &gt; n // 2:
        r = n - r
    return npr(n, r) // factorial(r)

<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Two fairly simple suggestions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>To avoid overflow, do everything in log space.  Use the fact that log(a * b) = log(a) + log(b), and log(a / b) = log(a) - log(b).  This makes it easy to work with very large factorials:  log(n! / m!) = log(n!) - log(m!), etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the gamma function instead of factorial.  You can find one in <code>scipy.stats.loggamma</code>.  It's a much more efficient way to calculate log-factorials than direct summation.  <code>loggamma(n) == log(factorial(n - 1))</code>, and similarly, <code>gamma(n) == factorial(n - 1)</code>.</p></li>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>if n is not far from r then using the recursive definition of combination is probably better, since xC0 == 1 you will only have a few iterations:</p>

<p>The relevant recursive definition here is:</p>

<p>nCr = (n-1)C(r-1) * n/r</p>

<p>This can be nicely computed using tail recursion with the following list:</p>

<p>[(n - r, 0), (n - r + 1, 1), (n - r + 2, 2), ..., (n - 1, r - 1), (n, r)]</p>

<p>which is of course easily generated in Python (we omit the first entry since nC0 = 1) by <code>izip(xrange(n - r + 1, n+1), xrange(1, r+1))</code> Note that this assumes r &lt;= n you need to check for that and swap them if they are not. Also to optimize use if r &lt; n/2  then r = n - r.</p>

<p>Now we simply need to apply the recursion step using tail recursion with reduce. We start with 1 since nC0 is 1 and then multiply the current value with the next entry from the list as below.</p>

<pre><code>from itertools import izip

reduce(lambda x, y: x * y[0] / y[1], izip(xrange(n - r + 1, n+1), xrange(1, r+1)), 1)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If you are computing N choose K (which is what I think you're doing with ncr), there is a dynamic programming solution that may be a lot faster. This will avoid factorial, plus you can keep the table if you want for later use.</p>

<p>Here is a teaching link for it:</p>

<p>I am unsure of how to better solve your first problem, though, sorry.</p>

<p>Edit: Here is the mock-up. There are some pretty hilarious off-by-one errors, so it can certainly stand some more clean up.</p>

<pre><code>import sys
n = int(sys.argv[1])+2#100
k = int(sys.argv[2])+1#20
table = [[0]*(n+2)]*(n+2)

for i in range(1,n):
    table[i][i] = 1
for i in range(1,n):
    for j in range(1,n-i):
        x = i+j
        if j == 1: table[x][j] = 1
        else: table[x][j] = table[x-1][j-1] + table[x-1][j]

print table[n][k]

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>If you don't need a pure-python solution, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gmpy/" rel="nofollow">gmpy</a> might help (<code>gmpy.comb</code> is very fast).</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>If your problem does not require knowing the exact number of permutations or combinations, then you could use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling%27s_approximation" rel="nofollow">Stirling's approximation</a> for the factorial.</p>

<p>That would lead to code like this:</p>

<pre><code>import math

def stirling(n):
    # http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling%27s_approximation
    return math.sqrt(2*math.pi*n)*(n/math.e)**n

def npr(n,r):
    return (stirling(n)/stirling(n-r) if n&gt;20 else
            math.factorial(n)/math.factorial(n-r))

def ncr(n,r):    
    return (stirling(n)/stirling(r)/stirling(n-r) if n&gt;20 else
            math.factorial(n)/math.factorial(r)/math.factorial(n-r))

print(npr(3,2))
# 6
print(npr(100,20))
# 1.30426670868e+39
print(ncr(3,2))
# 3
print(ncr(100,20))
# 5.38333246453e+20

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Using <code>xrange()</code> instead of <code>range()</code> will speed things up slightly due to the fact that no intermediate list is created, populated, iterated through, and then destroyed. Also, <code>reduce()</code> with <code>operator.mul</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>For N choose K you could use Pascals triangle. Basically you would need to keep array of size N around to compute all the N choose K values. Only additions would be required.</p>
