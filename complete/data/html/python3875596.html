<h3>Question (ID-3875596):</h3><h2>equivalent of Python's "with" in Ruby</h2><p>In Python, the <code>with</code> statement is used to make sure that clean-up code always gets called, regardless of exceptions being thrown or function calls returning. For example:</p>

<pre><code>with open("temp.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("hi")
    raise ValueError("spitespite")
</code></pre>

<p>Here, the file is closed, even though an exception was raised. A better explanation is <a href="http://effbot.org/zone/python-with-statement.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>Is there an equivalent for this construct in Ruby? Or can you code one up, since Ruby has continuations? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Ruby has syntactically lightweight support for literal anonymous procedures (called <em>blocks</em> in Ruby). Therefore, it doesn't need a new language feature for this.</p>

<p>(In general, it is a bad sign, if you need to add language features. You should be able to implement everything in a library, otherwise it is a sign of bad language design.)</p>

<p>So, what you normally do, is to write a method which takes a block of code, allocates the resource, executes the block of code in the context of that resource and then closes the resource.</p>

<p>Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>def with(klass, *args)
  yield r = klass.open(*args)
ensure
  r.close
end
</code></pre>

<p>You could use it like this:</p>

<pre><code>with File, 'temp.txt', 'w' do |f|
  f.write 'hi'
  raise 'spitespite'
end
</code></pre>

<p>However, this is a very procedural way to do this. Ruby is an object-oriented language, which means that the responsibility of properly executing a block of code in the context of a <code>File</code> should belong to the <code>File</code> class:</p>

<pre><code>File.open 'temp.txt', 'w' do |f|
  f.write 'hi'
  raise 'spitespite'
end
</code></pre>

<p>This could be implemented something like this:</p>

<pre><code>def File.open(*args)
  f = new(*args)
  return f unless block_given?
  yield f
ensure
  f.close if block_given?
end
</code></pre>

<p>This is a general pattern that is implemented by lots of classes in the Ruby core library, standard libraries and third-party libraries.</p>

<hr>

<p>A more close correspondence to the generic Python context manager protocol would be:</p>

<pre><code>def with(ctx)
  yield ctx.setup
ensure
  ctx.teardown
end

class File
  def setup; self end
  alias_method :teardown, :close
end

with File.open('temp.txt', 'w') do |f|
  f.write 'hi'
  raise 'spitespite'
end
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this is virtually indistinguishable from the Python example, but it didn't require the addition of new syntax to the language.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The equivalent in Ruby would be to pass a block to the File.open method.</p>

<pre><code>File.open(...) do |file|
  #do stuff with file
end  #file is closed
</code></pre>

<p>This is the idiom that Ruby uses and one that you should get comfortable with.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You could use Block Arguments to do this in Ruby:</p>

<pre><code>class Object  
    def with(obj)  
        obj.__enter__  
        yield  
        obj.__exit__  
    end  
end
</code></pre>

<p>Now, you could add <code>__enter__</code> and <code>__exit__</code> methods to another class and use it like this:</p>

<pre><code>with GetSomeObject("somefile.text") do |foo|  
    do_something_with(foo)
end  
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You could always use a <code>try..catch..finally</code> block, where the <code>finally</code> section contains code to clean up.</p>

<p>Edit: sorry, misspoke: you'd want <code>begin..rescue..ensure</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I believe you are looking for <a href="http://ruby.activeventure.com/usersguide/rg/ensure.html" rel="nofollow">ensure</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I'll just add some more explanations for others; credit should go to them.</p>

<p>Indeed, in Ruby, clean-up code is as others said, in <code>ensure</code> clause; but wrapping things in blocks is ubiquitous in Ruby, and this is how it is done most efficiently and most in spirit of Ruby. When translating, don't translate directly word-for-word, you will get some very strange sentences. Similarly, don't expect everything from Python to have one-to-one correspondence to Ruby.</p>

<p>From the link you posted:</p>

<pre><code>class controlled_execution:
    def __enter__(self):
        set things up
        return thing
    def __exit__(self, type, value, traceback):
        tear things down

with controlled_execution() as thing:
     some code
</code></pre>

<p>Ruby way, something like this (man, I'm probably doing this all wrong :D ):</p>

<pre><code>def controlled_executor
  begin
    do_setup
    yield
  ensure
    do_cleanup
  end
end

controlled_executor do ...
  some_code
end
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, you can add arguments to both <code>controlled executor</code> (to be called in a usual fashion), and to yield (in which case you need to add arguments to the block as well). Thus, to implement what you quoted above,</p>

<pre><code>class File
  def my_open(file, mode="r")
    handle = open(file, mode)
    begin
      yield handle
    ensure
      handle.close
    end
  end
end

File.my_open("temp.txt", "w") do |f|
  f.write("hi")
  raise Exception.new("spitesprite")
end
</code></pre>
