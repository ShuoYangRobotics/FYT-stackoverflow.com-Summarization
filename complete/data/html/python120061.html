<h3>Question (ID-120061):</h3><h2>Fetch a Wikipedia article with Python</h2><p>I try to fetch a Wikipedia article with Phython's urllib:</p>

<pre><code>f = urllib.urlopen("http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Albert_Einstein&amp;printable=yes")           
s = f.read()
f.close()
</code></pre>

<p>However instead of the html page I get the following response: Error - Wikimedia Foundation:</p>

<p>Request: GET <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Albert_Einstein&amp;printable=yes" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Albert_Einstein&amp;printable=yes</a>, from 192.35.17.11 via knsq1.knams.wikimedia.org (squid/2.6.STABLE21) to ()
Error: ERR_ACCESS_DENIED, errno [No Error] at Tue, 23 Sep 2008 09:09:08 GMT </p>

<p>Wikipedia seems to block request which are not from a standard browser.</p>

<p>Anybody know how to work around this?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>It is not a solution to the specific problem. But it might be intersting for you to use the mwclient library (<a href="http://botwiki.sno.cc/wiki/Python:Mwclient" rel="nofollow">http://botwiki.sno.cc/wiki/Python:Mwclient</a>) instead. That would be so much easier. Especially since you will directly get the article contents which removes the need for you to parse the html.</p>

<p>I have used it myself for two projects, and it works very well.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You need to use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-urllib2.html" rel="nofollow">urllib2</a> that superseedes <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-urllib.html" rel="nofollow">urllib</a> in the <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/" rel="nofollow">python std library</a> in order to change the user agent.</p>

<p>Straight from the <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/urllib2-examples.html" rel="nofollow">examples</a></p>

<pre><code>import urllib2
opener = urllib2.build_opener()
opener.addheaders = [('User-agent', 'Mozilla/5.0')]
infile = opener.open('http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Albert_Einstein&amp;printable=yes')
page = infile.read()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Rather than trying to trick Wikipedia, you should consider using their <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API" rel="nofollow">High-Level API</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Try changing the user agent header you are sending in your request to something like:
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008072820 Ubuntu/8.04 (hardy) Firefox/3.0.1 (Linux Mint)</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>The general solution I use for any site is to access the page using Firefox and, using an extension such as Firebug, record all details of the HTTP request including any cookies.</p>

<p>In your program (in this case in Python) you should try to send a HTTP request as similar as necessary to the one that worked from Firefox. This often includes setting the User-Agent, Referer and Cookie fields, but there may be others.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>In case you are trying to access Wikipedia content (and don't need any specific information about the page itself), instead of using the api you should just call index.php with 'action=raw' in order to get the wikitext, like in:</p>

<p>'http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?<strong>action=raw</strong>&amp;title=Main_Page'</p>

<p>Or, if you want the HTML code, use 'action=render' like in:</p>

<p>'http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?<strong>action=render</strong>&amp;title=Main_Page'</p>

<p>You can also define a section to get just part of the content with something like 'section=3'.</p>

<p>You could then access it using the urllib2 module (as sugested in the chosen answer).
However, if you need information about the page itself (such as revisions), you'll be better using the mwclient as sugested above.</p>

<p>Refer to <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API%3aFAQ#get_the_content_of_a_page_.28wikitext.29.3F" rel="nofollow">MediaWiki's FAQ</a> if you need more information.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><pre><code>import urllib
s = urllib.urlopen('http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?action=raw&amp;title=Albert_Einstein').read()
</code></pre>

<p>This seems to work for me without changing the user agent. Without the "action=raw" it does not work for me.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>You don't need to impersonate a browser user-agent; any user-agent at all will work, just not a blank one.</p>
