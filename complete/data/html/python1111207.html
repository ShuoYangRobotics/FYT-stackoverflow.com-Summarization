<h3>Question (ID-1111207):</h3><h2>How do Python and PHP compare for ecommerce?</h2><p>If I were to start an ecommerce store, which language would you suggest I start with?  Python or PHP?</p>

<p>And would it be wise to use Python for an ecommerce site in favor of PHP?  PHP has lots of shopping carts, both open source and commercial.  </p>

<p>Is Python the future of Web Development ?</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>I would like to clear out that i am not asking for Shopping carts solutions and links to them.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-9):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Whatever language you know better. I think this should be the first criterion.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I'm personally a fan of Python, specificity with Django for the web. For ecommerce applications there is the <a href="http://www.satchmoproject.com/" rel="nofollow">Satchmo Project</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Honestly, the languages don't really matter. </p>

<p>Both PHP and Python are capable to develop great websites and there are many examples for that.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I don't think you'll get a good answer to this one. Everyone uses php, and python ecommerce is probably mainly in-house built. If there was a popular python solution (something like django for web platforms) - then I doubt there would be any discussion.</p>

<p>However - as of now I have yet to see a good all-in one system.
On the upside, using python you can easily create something simple for your business.</p>

<p>As there are not going to be a lot of new drastic revisions to the Python language in the future, we can expect some good apps to come out soon. My bet today is on django apps.</p>

<p>Using php is probably good in the short run. Not that I would ever go back to it...</p>

<p>PS: I forgot about another one: ASP.NET (mvc?). If you are feeling particularly adventurous, they have loads of "controls" and products. However it all confuses me a lot.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I'd think that the overall implementation of any solution you choose (whether off-the-shelf or custom built) will be more important than any inherent speed differences between Python and PHP.</p>

<p>There are some truly shocking examples out there so it's worth doing research based upon your exact requirements. A shopping cart itself is a relatively simple object with standard functionality so if this is for a small-medium size store I'd go for whatever you feel more comfortable with.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>This is a challenging question to answer.  If you are going for an off the-shelf package you're going to need to use PHP - this then gives you a range of packages including Magento, osCommerce (yuck) and so on.</p>

<p>If you are planning to develop a bespoke, or partially bespoke solution, then you probably want to look at using a framework to cut down the amount of code you need to write from the outset.  Again, there are various options for each language. </p>

<p>Python and Django has a web framework for satchmo that could really take the legwork out of an ecommerce build whilst giving a level of flexibility that you usually don't get from an off-the-shelf package.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I would say that PHP carts are probably more mature and have more features than the Django ones. (Note I've only had experience with 2 PHP shopping carts and no Python ones)</p>

<p>On the other hand, PHP is a poorly designed language and is usually slower than Python in benchmarks. Depending on your needs, a Python shopping cart may suffice.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>More important than the language is the developer's ability to translate business logic into elegant and maintainable code. But I <i>would</i> recommend building with an MVC framework in whatever language you choose. Both PHP and Python have options there (django, CakePHP are popular choices).</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>PHP's memory management issues are overlooked because it's a language designed for the web, where long lasting processes aren't a problem.</p>

<p>This is the main reason I never favor PHP.</p>
