<h3>Question (ID-2143549):</h3><h2>Undefined variable from import when using wxPython in pydev</h2><p>I just downloaded wxPython, and was running some of the sample programs from <a href="http://wiki.wxpython.org/Getting%20Started#First_steps" rel="nofollow">here</a>. However, on every line that uses a variable from wx.*, I get a "Undefined variable from import error"</p>

<p>For example, the following program generates five errors on lines 1,4,8, and two on line 5:</p>

<pre><code>import wx
class MyFrame(wx.Frame):
    """ We simply derive a new class of Frame. """
    def __init__(self, parent, title):
        wx.Frame.__init__(self, parent, title=title, size=(200,100))
        self.control = wx.TextCtrl(self, style=wx.TE_MULTILINE)
        self.Show(True)
app = wx.App(False)
frame = MyFrame(None, 'Small editor')
app.MainLoop()
</code></pre>

<p>The program, however, compiles and runs perfectly. I haven't made any significant modifications to pydev or eclipse, and the wxPython install is fresh.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>This happened to me.  I had installed PyDev and configured it and went on my merry way.  A few months later, I installed wxPython and had this same problem.  An easy way to fix is in eclipse:</p>

<p>Window -> Preferences -> Pydev -> Interpreter - Python</p>

<p>Just remove the default interpreter and add a new one (it can be the same one you had before).  Pydev/Eclipse searches through your Python Installation directory and adds the correct paths to your PYTHONPATH.  I restarted and all was well.  I noticed it added</p>

<pre>C:\Python26\lib\site-packages\wx-2.8-msw-unicode</pre>

<p>So you could probably just add that to the PYTHONPATH instead of going through all the above, assuming that path is where this directory is installed.</p>

<p>By the way, I am using:</p>

<ol>
<li>Eclipse Helios</li>
<li>Pydev 1.6.2.2010090812</li>
<li>Python 2.6</li>
<li>wxPython2.8-win32-unicode-2.8.11.0-py26 </li>
</ol>

<p>But I think this should be a pretty general solution to the problem.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>PyDev finds the references when you setup the interpreter in </p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>Window -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Pydev -&gt; Interpreter - Python
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>If wxPython was not in your site-packages directory when you first setup the interpreter, then the references to the wx objects and names will not be known to the editor lookup function.  To fix this, remove the interpreter from </p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>Window -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Pydev -&gt; Interpreter - Python
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>and then select new.  Re-add the python installation again and press apply.  At this time, Pydev will import all of the site-package objects again and should populate the lookup dictionary.  You'll want to restart Eclipse for changes to take place.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Some of the newer versions of pydev have a hard time tracking down imported names. It's probably nothing.</p>

<p>Report the bug to aptana, though no doubt they already know about it.</p>

<p>I frequently get this problem when working with packages I've just recently downloaded, and eventually the errors go away. Just recently with pygame.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Use <code>CTRL+1</code> key combination on error text and add <code>#@UndefinedVariable</code> or <code>#@UnresolvedImport</code> in the end of corresponding lines with errors, it will remove these warnings temporary.

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Try</p>

<p>wx = wx</p>

<p>Don't ask why. This approach (that I found when trying to break the problem in smaller parts) just seems to remove the wx undefined variables problem.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I had the same problem and it went away when I updated to PyDev 1.5.6.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><h1>import  wx</h1>

<p>from    wx import wx #@UnresolvedImport</p>

<p>will fix.
