<h3>Question (ID-4484255):</h3><h2>Python print() output discrepancy</h2><p>I'm messing around with python, following this tutorial:</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Non-Programmer%27s_Tutorial_for_Python_3/Hello,_World" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Non-Programmer%27s_Tutorial_for_Python_3/Hello,_World</a></p>

<p>According to it, my output for the following code:</p>

<pre><code>print("Single String")
print("Concat", "String")
</code></pre>

<p>Should look like this:</p>

<pre><code>Single String
Concat String
</code></pre>

<p>But it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>Single String
('Concat', 'String')
</code></pre>

<p>Why is this? I'm on OSX with Python 2.6.</p>

<p>EDIT: I just realized the guide is for 3.0, and I have 2.6. Is that causing the issue? What is the quickest way to upgrade my Python install?</p>

<p>EDIT 2: An upgrade fixed it :) Accepted answer explains the differences.</p>

<p>This is a <code>tuple</code>. When you put the <code>,</code> it becomes a <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences" rel="nofollow">tuple</a> and hence Python outputs it the same way.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = ('Let', 'Us', 'Test')
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(t)
&lt;type 'tuple'&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>A tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas.</p>

<p>I believe the quickest way to upgrade would be to go to the <a href="http://www.python.org/download/" rel="nofollow">Python website</a> and download v3.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If you are using Python 2.x you can just use</p>

<pre><code>print "Single", "String"
</code></pre>

<p>Python 3.x changes the way print works, previously it was a statement and now it is a function.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The reason is that you are running a Python 3 tutorial with Python 2.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>To get the behaviour you want, you need to print a string representation of the tuple. You can get this by using the <code>join</code> method on strings:</p>

<pre><code>print ' '.join(('a', 'b'))
</code></pre>

<p>The reason the behaviour is not as expected is that in Python 2, <code>print</code> is a keyword. In Python 3, it has been replaced by a function (also <code>print</code>), so the latter syntax calls the function instead of printing a tuple. You can replicate the behaviour you have see in Python 3 with</p>

<pre><code>print(('a', 'b'))
</code></pre>

<p>One set of parentheses for the function call, and one for the tuple.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>In Python 2.6 you can also say</p>

<pre><code>from __future__ import print_statement
</code></pre>

<p>to get the 3.x syntax.</p>
