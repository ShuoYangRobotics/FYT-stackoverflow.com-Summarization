<h3>Question (ID-757949):</h3><h2>Why doesn't the regex match when I add groups?</h2><p>I have this regex code in python :</p>

<pre><code>if re.search(r"\{\\fad|fade\(\d{1,4},\d{1,4}\)\}", text):
  print(re.search(r"\{\\fad|fade\((\d{1,4}),(\d{1,4})\)\}", text).groups())
</code></pre>

<p><code>text</code> is <code>{\fad(200,200)}Ã‰pisode 101 : {\i1}The Ghost{\i0}\Nv. 1.03</code> and read from a file (don't know if that helps).</p>

<p>This returns the following:</p>

<pre><code>(None, None)
</code></pre>

<p>When I change the regex in the print to <code>r"\{\\fad\((\d{1,4}),(\d{1,4})\)\}"</code>, it returns the correct values:</p>

<pre><code>(200, 200)
</code></pre>

<p>Can anyone see why the conditional <code>fad|fade</code> matches the regex in the <code>re.search</code> but doesn't return the correct values of the groups in the print?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Put extra parens around the choice: <code>re.search(r"{(?:\\fad|fade)\((\d{1,4}),(\d{1,4})\)}", text).groups()</code></p>

<p>Also, escaping <code>{}</code> braces isn't necessary, it just needlessly clutters your regexp.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The bracket is part of the or branch starting with fade, so it's looking for either "{fad" or "fade(...".  You need to group the fad|fade part together.  Try:</p>

<pre><code>r"\{\\(?:fad|fade)\(\d{1,4},\d{1,4}\)\}"
</code></pre>

<p><strong>[Edit]</strong>
The reason you do get into the if block is because the regex <strong>is</strong> matching, but only because it detects it starts with "{\fad".  However, that part of the match contains no groups.  You need to match with the part that defines the groups if you want to capture them.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Try this:</p>

<pre><code>r"\{\\fade?\(\d{1,4},\d{1,4}\)\}"
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I think your conditional is looking for "\fad" or "fade", I think you need to move a \ outside the grouping if you want to look for "\fad" or "\fade".</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Try this instead:</p>

<pre><code>r"\{\\fade?\((\d{1,4}),(\d{1,4})\)\}"
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>e?</code> is an optional <code>e</code>.
The way you have it now matches <code>{\fad</code> or <code>fade(0000,0000)}</code></p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I don't know the python dialect of regular expressions, but wouldn't you need to 'group' the "fad|fade" somehow to make sure it isn't trying to find "fad OR fade(etc..."?</p>
