<h3>Question (ID-1048658):</h3><h2>Resize images in directory</h2><p>I have a directory full of images that I would like to resize to around 60% of their original size.</p>

<p>How would I go about doing this? Can be in either Python or Perl</p>

<p>Cheers</p>

If you really need to control this from Perl, then you could use <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Image-Magick" rel="nofollow">Image::Magick</a>, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Image-Resize" rel="nofollow">Image::Resize</a> or <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Imager" rel="nofollow">Imager</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Can it be in shell?</p>

<pre><code>mkdir resized
for a in *.jpg; do convert "$a" -resize 60% resized/"$a"; done
</code></pre>

<p>If you have > 1 core, you can do it like this:</p>

<pre><code>find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -name '*.jpg' -print0 | xargs -0 -P3 -I XXX convert XXX -resize 60% resized/XXX
</code></pre>

<p>-P3 means that you want to resize up to 3 images at the same time (parallelization).</p>

<p>If you don't need to keep originals you can use mogrify, but I prefer to use convert, and then rm ...; mv ... - just to be on safe side if resizing would (for whatever reason) fail.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Use <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/perl-magick.php" rel="nofollow">PerlMagick</a>, it's an interface to the popular <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/" rel="nofollow">ImageMagick</a> suite of command line tools to do just this kind of stuff. <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/api.php#python" rel="nofollow">PythonMagic</a> is available as well.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>If you want to do it programatically, which I assume is the case, use PIL to resize e.g.</p>

<pre><code>newIm = im.resize((newW, newH)
</code></pre>

<p>then save it to same file or a new location.</p>

<p>Go through the folder recursively and apply resize function to all images.</p>

<p>I have come up with a sample script which I think will work for you. You can improve on it: Maybe make it graphical, add more options e.g. same extension or may be all png, resize sampling linear/bilinear etc</p>

<pre><code>import os
import sys
from PIL import Image

def resize(folder, fileName, factor):
    filePath = os.path.join(folder, fileName)
    im = Image.open(filePath)
    w, h  = im.size
    newIm = im.resize((int(w*factor), int(h*factor)))
    # i am saving a copy, you can overrider orginal, or save to other folder
    newIm.save(filePath+"copy.png")

def bulkResize(imageFolder, factor):
    imgExts = ["png", "bmp", "jpg"]
    for path, dirs, files in os.walk(imageFolder):
        for fileName in files:
            ext = fileName[-3:].lower()
            if ext not in imgExts:
                continue

            resize(path, fileName, factor)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    imageFolder=sys.argv[1] # first arg is path to image folder
    resizeFactor=float(sys.argv[2])/100.0# 2nd is resize in %
    bulkResize(imageFolder, resizeFactor)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I use Python with PIL (Python Image Library). Of course there are specialized programs to do this.</p>

<p>Many people use PIL to such things. Look at: <a href="http://pandemoniumillusion.wordpress.com/2008/05/04/quick-image-resizing-with-python/" rel="nofollow">Quick image resizing with python</a></p>

<p>PIL is very powerful and recently I have found this recipe:

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>do you need to just resize it or you want to resize programmatically?
If just resize use PixResizer. <a href="http://bluefive.pair.com/pixresizer.htm" rel="nofollow">http://bluefive.pair.com/pixresizer.htm</a></p>
