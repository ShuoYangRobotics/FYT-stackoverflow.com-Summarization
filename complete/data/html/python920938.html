<h3>Question (ID-920938):</h3><h2>Formatted output in OpenOffice/Microsoft Word with Python</h2><p>I am working on a project (in Python) that needs formatted, editable output. Since the end-user isn't going to be technically proficient, the output needs to be in a word processor editable format. The formatting is complex (bullet points, paragraphs, bold face, etc).</p>

<p>Is there a way to generate such a report using Python? I feel like there should be a way to do this using Microsoft Word/OpenOffice templates and Python, but I can't find anything advanced enough to get good formatting. Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Use <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickstart.html" rel="nofollow">RST</a>.</p>

<p>It's trivial to produce, since it's plain text.</p>

<p>It's trivial to edit, since it's plain text with a few extra characters to provide structural information.</p>

<p>It formats nicely using a bunch of <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/tools.html" rel="nofollow">tools</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I know there is an <a href="http://www.rexx.com/~dkuhlman/odtwriter.html" rel="nofollow">odtwriter for docutils</a>. You could generate your output as <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html" rel="nofollow">reStructuredText</a> and feed it to odtwriter or look into what odtwriter is using on the backend to generate the ODT and use that.</p>

<p>(I'd probably go with generating rst output and then hacking odtwriter to output the stuff I want (and contribute the fixes back to the project), because that's probably a whole lot easier that trying to render your stuff to ODT directly.)</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I've used xlwt to create Excel documents using python, but I haven't needed to write word files yet. I've found this package, <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/OOoPy/1.4.4873" rel="nofollow">OOoPy</a>, but I haven't used it.</p>

<p>Also you might want to try outputting html files and having the users open them in Word.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>A little known, and slightly evil fact: If you create an HTML file, and stick a .doc extension on it, Word will open it as a Word document, and most users will be none the wiser.</p>

<p>Except maybe a very technical person will say, my this is a small Word file! :)</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Use the <a href="https://github.com/mikemaccana/python-docx" rel="nofollow">Python Docx</a> module for this - 100% Python, tables, images, document properties, headings, paragraphs, and more.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I think OpenOffice has some Python bindings - you should be able to write OO macros in Python.</p>

<p>But I would use HTML instead - Word and OO.org are rather good at editing it and you can write it from Python easily (although Word saves a lot of mess which could complicate parsing it by your Python app).</p>
