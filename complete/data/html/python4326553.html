<h3>Question (ID-4326553):</h3><h2>Can I count on order being preserved in a Python tuple?</h2><p>I've got a list of datetimes from which I want to construct time segments.  In other words, turn <code>[t0, t1, ... tn]</code> into <code>[(t0,t1),(t1,t2),...,(tn-1, tn)]</code>.  I've done it this way:</p>

<pre><code># start by sorting list of datetimes
mdtimes.sort()
# construct tuples which represent possible start and end dates

# left edges
dtg0 = [x for x in mdtimes]
dtg0.pop()

# right edges
dtg1 = [x for x in mdtimes]
dtg1.reverse()
dtg1.pop()
dtg1.sort()

dtsegs = zip(dtg0,dtg1)
</code></pre>

<p>Questions...</p>

<ol>
<li>Can I count on tn-1 &lt; tn for any (tn-1,tn) after I've created them this way?  (Is ordering preserved?)</li>
<li>Is it good practice to copy the original <code>mdtimes</code> list with list comprehensions?  If not how should it be done?</li>
<li><p>The purpose for constructing these tuples is to iterate over them and segment a data set with <code>tn-1</code> and <code>tn</code>.  Is this a reasonable approach? i.e.</p>

<pre><code>datasegment = [x for x in bigdata if ( (x['datetime'] &gt; tleft) and (x['datetime'] &lt; tright))] 
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You can achieve the same with <code>zip</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; l = ["t0", "t1", "t2", "t3", "t4", "t5", "t6"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; zip(l[::2], l[1::2])
[('t0', 't1'), ('t2', 't3'), ('t4', 't5')]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Both <code>list</code> and <code>tuple</code> are ordered.</p>

<pre><code>dtg0, dtg1 = itertools.tee(mdtimes)
next(dtg0)
dtsegs = zip(dtg0, dtg1)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Instead of: <code>dtg0 = [x for x in mdtimes]</code>, <code>dtg0 = mdtimes[:]</code> would do, since you just copy one list into another.</p>

<p>As for order, <code>zip</code>'s order is well defined, and both lists and tuples are ordered collections, so you should have no problem here.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Turning (x1, x2, x3, ...) into [(x1, x2), (x2, x3), ...] is called a pairwise combination, and it's so common a pattern that the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/itertools.html#recipes" rel="nofollow">itertools</a> documentation provides a recipe:</p>

<pre><code>def pairwise(iterable):
    "s -&gt; (s0,s1), (s1,s2), (s2, s3), ..."
    a, b = tee(iterable)
    next(b, None)
    return izip(a, b)

for ta, tb in pairwise(mdtimes): 
    ....
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p><strong>This is an answer to the question "Is this a reasonable approach?" (which appears to have been ignored by all).</strong></p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> You may want/need to lift your gaze from making a pairwise thingy out of <code>mdtimes</code> to the encompassing problem (segmenting <code>bigdata</code>).</p>

<p><strong>Detail:</strong></p>

<p>The desired use of the result is expressed as:</p>

<pre><code>datasegment = [x for x in bigdata if ( (x['datetime'] &gt; tleft) and (x['datetime'] &lt; tright))] 
</code></pre>

<p>which is better expressed as:</p>

<pre><code>datasegment = [x for x in bigdata if tleft &lt; x['datetime'] &lt; tright] 
</code></pre>

<p>Note that as that stands, it will not include any cases where the timestamp is exactly equal to one of the boundary points, so let's change it to:</p>

<pre><code>datasegment = [x for x in bigdata if tleft &lt;= x['datetime'] &lt; tright]
</code></pre>

<p>But that's going to appear in a loop:</p>

<pre><code>for tleft, tright in dtsegs:
    datasegment = [x for x in bigdata if tleft &lt;= x['datetime'] &lt; tright]
    do_something_with(datasegment)
</code></pre>

<p>Whoops! That's going to take time proportional to <code>len(bigdata) * len(dtsegs)</code> ... what are likely values of <code>len(bigdata)</code> and <code>len(dtsegs)</code>?</p>

<p>If <code>bigdata</code> is sorted, what you want to do can be done in time proportional to <code>N</code>, where <code>N = len(bigdata)</code>. If <code>bigdata</code> is not already sorted, it can be sorted in time proportional to <code>N * log(N)</code>.</p>

<p>You might like to ask another question ...</p>

<p>It's also worth pointing out that any items in <code>bigdata</code> that have a timestamp &lt; min(mdtimes) or >= max(mdtimes) will not be included in any data segment ... is this intentional?</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><ol>
<li><p>Tuple order is as you insert values into the tuple. They're not going to be sorted as I think you're asking. <code>zip</code> will again, retain the order you inserted the values in.</p></li>
<li><p>It's an acceptable method, but I have 2 alternate suggestions: Use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/copy.html" rel="nofollow">copy</a> module, or use <code>dtg1 = mdtimes[:]</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Sounds reasonable.</p></li>
</ol>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I'm no expert, but aren't you quadrupling your memory requirements by copying the list and then making a new list of pairs taken from two lists? Why not just do the following:</p>

<pre><code>dtsegs = [(dtg0[i], dtg0[i+1]) for i in range(len(dtg0)-1)]
</code></pre>

<p>Dunno how "Pythonic" that is, though.</p>

<p>EDIT: Actually, looking at what you need to do with this list of tuples, you could just do this [i] and [i+1] stuff directly at that level and not even create this new structure at all. I don't know how many dates you're dealing with, though - if it's some small number I suppose it doesn't really matter.</p>

<p>For what it's worth, a couple of the other answerers here seem to be misunderstanding your question, though I can't comment on their posts since I don't have enough reputation yet :) Ignacio Vazquez-Abrams's solution seems the best to me, though his "next(dtg0)" should probably be "next(dtg1)" (?)</p>
