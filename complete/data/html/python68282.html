<h3>Question (ID-68282):</h3><h2>Why do you need explicitly have the "self" argument into a Python method?</h2><p>When defining a method on a class in Python, it looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>class MyClass(object):
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
</code></pre>

<p>But in some other languages, such as C#, you have a reference to the object that the method is bound to with the "this" keyword without declaring it as an argument in the method prototype.  </p>

<p>Was this an intentional language design decision in Python or are there some implementation details that require the passing of "self" as an argument?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I like to quote Peters' Zen of Python.  "Explicit is better than implicit."</p>

<p>In Java and C++, '<code>this.</code>' can be deduced, except when you have variable names that make it impossible to deduce.   So you sometimes need it and sometimes don't.</p>

<p>Python elects to make things like this explicit rather than based on a rule.  </p>

<p>Additionally, since nothing is implied or assumed, parts of the implementation are exposed.  <code>self.__class__</code>, <code>self.__dict__</code> and other "internal" structures are available in an obvious way.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>It's to minimize the difference between methods and functions. It allows you to easily generate methods in metaclasses, or add methods at runtime to pre-existing classes.</p>

<p>e.g.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class C(object):
...     def foo(self):
...         print "Hi!"
...
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; def bar(self):
...     print "Bork bork bork!"
...
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; c = C()
&gt;&gt;&gt; C.bar = bar
&gt;&gt;&gt; c.bar()
Bork bork bork!
&gt;&gt;&gt; c.foo()
Hi!
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It also (as far as I know) makes the implementation of the python runtime easier.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I suggest that one should read <a href="http://neopythonic.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Guido van Rossum's blog</a> on this topic - <a href="http://neopythonic.blogspot.com/2008/10/why-explicit-self-has-to-stay.html" rel="nofollow">Why explicit self has to stay</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Python doesn't force you on using "self". You can give it whatever name you want. You just have to remember that the first argument in a method definition header is a reference to the object.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Some discussion about self can be found in this <a href="http://www.python.org/search/hypermail/python-1994q2/0511.html" rel="nofollow">mailing list thread</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>There is also another very simple answer: according to the <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/" rel="nofollow">zen of python</a>, "explicit is better than implicit".</p>
