<h3>Question (ID-4546879):</h3><h2>Which one to prefer - line.lower() vs. word.lower()</h2><p>When I need to split a line, and put all words in a list as lowercase, which one would be the preferred way:</p>

<p>1.)</p>

<pre><code>    list = []
    for word in line.split():
        word = word.lower()
        list.append(word)
</code></pre>

<p>2.) </p>

<pre><code>    list = []
    for word in line.lower().split():
        list.append(word)
</code></pre>

<p>Is there any performance impact? Does it actually make any difference (except the second one being shorter).</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>
Added the missing <code>split()</code>.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Maybe try <code>list comprehension</code></p>

<pre><code>[x.lower() for x in line]
</code></pre>

<p>will return a list with the words lowered. If you want to omit spaces:</p>

<pre><code>[x.lower() for x in line if x.strip() != '']
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Something more compact maybe:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = "I AM A DEVELOPER"

&gt;&gt;&gt; a.lower().split()
['i', 'am', 'a', 'developer']
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I don't know about speed, but this doesn't do what you think it does:  <code>for word in line.lower()</code>.  It yields you characters, not words.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>As long as you are calling <code>lower</code> and <code>append</code> for each word, I don't think it really makes any difference the order in which you call them.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>My preference is:</p>

<pre><code>words = line.lower().split()
</code></pre>

<p>this is better than:</p>

<pre><code>words = [word.lower() for word in line.split()]
</code></pre>

<p>If n is the number of words, the first does n + 1 allocations, whereas the second does 2n.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Since list comprehensions have already been pointed out in another answer, here's one other approach:</p>

<pre><code>lst=map(lambda x: x.lower(),line)
</code></pre>

<p>Also, please try not to use variable names like <code>list</code> that are already used in Python. That's really bad form and would cause a lot of confusion in any non-trivial project.</p>
