<h3>Question (ID-1448819):</h3><h2>How to install pysqlite?</h2><p>I am trying to install pysqlite (Python interface to the SQLite). I downloaded the file with the package (pysqlite-2.5.5.tar.gz). And I did the following:</p>

<pre><code>gunzip pysqlite-2.5.5.tar.gz
tar xvf pysqlite-2.5.5.tar
\cd pysqlite-2.5.5
python setup.py install
</code></pre>

<p>At the last step I have a problem. I get the following error message:</p>

<pre><code>error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://forums.opensuse.org/applications/400363-gcc-fails-during-pysqlite-install.html" rel="nofollow">I found that other peoples also had this problem</a>.</p>

<p>As far as I understood in the person had a problem because sqlite2 was not installed. But in my case, I have sqlite3 (I can run it from command line).</p>

<p>May be I should change some paths in <code>"setup.cfg"</code>? At the moment I have there:</p>

<pre><code>#define=
#include_dirs=/usr/local/include
#library_dirs=/usr/local/lib
libraries=sqlite3
define=SQLITE_OMIT_LOAD_EXTENSION
</code></pre>

<p>And if I type "which sqlite3" I get:</p>

<pre><code>/usr/bin/sqlite3
</code></pre>

<p>I saw a similar question here. The answer was "you need sqlite3-dev". But, even if it is the case, how to check if I have <code>sqlite3-dev</code>. And if I do not have it how to get it?</p>

<p>Can anybody pleas help me with that problem.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance. </p>

<p><a href="http://docs.python.org/library/sqlite3.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/library/sqlite3.html</a></p>

<p>If you insist on compiling it yourself, the package is called sqlite3-devel, you can find it e.g. <a href="http://rpm.pbone.net/index.php3/stat/4/idpl/7965440/com/sqlite3-devel-3.5.7-17.1.i586.rpm.html" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><blockquote>
  <p>how to check if I have "sqlite3-dev"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's entirely dependent on what Linux distro you're using -- is it Fedora, Suse, Ubuntu, Gentoo, Mandrake, or which other one out of the dozens out there; there are several packaging strategies and tools used to check which packages are there, get more, and so forth.</p>

<p>So, never ask questions about checking, getting or tweaking packages on Linux without specifying the distribution[s] of interest -- it makes it essentially impossible to offer precise, specific help.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: the simplest way I know of getting details about your Linux distribution (works on all the ones I have at hand to try, but I don't have a particularly wide array...;-):</p>

<pre><code>$ cat /etc/*-release
DISTRIB_CODENAME=hardy
DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Ubuntu 8.04.2"
DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu
DISTRIB_RELEASE=8.04
...etc, etc...
</code></pre>

<p>This is probably going to be the contents of file <code>/etc/lsb-release</code>, but I'm suggesting the <code>*-release</code> because I think there may be some other such files involved.</p>

<p>Of course, if the need to check your distro applies inside a file or program, reading this file (or files) and locating specific contents will also be quite feasible; but for the purpose of informing would-be helpers about what distro you're using, the <code>cat</code> at the shell prompt is going to be quite sufficient;-).</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I'm the one who answered the other question :) On systems that use RPM packages, i.e. you normally use 'yum' to install things, the package is named sqlite3-devel.</p>

<p>On most Debian based systems (i.e. you use apt-get to install packages), the package is named sqlite3-dev.</p>

<p>This is a very typical difference between the two, most other packages follow the same naming convention.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I had the same trouble with gcc failing with Ubuntu Karmic. I fixed this by installing the python-dev package. In my case, I'm working with python2.4, so I installed the python2.4-dev package. The python-dev package should work for python2.6.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I had the same problem, I'm using python 2.4, neither <code>sqlite3-dev</code> nor <code>libsqlite3-dev</code> are available for CentOS.</p>

<pre><code>yum install python-devel
</code></pre>

<p>seems to solve the issue.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I had following compile errors on <strong>CentOS release 5.6</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>src/cache.h:34: error: expected specifier-qualifier-list before 'PyObject_HEAD'
src/cache.h:44: error: expected specifier-qualifier-list before 'PyObject_HEAD'
src/cache.h:61: error: expected '=', ',', ';', 'asm' or '__attribute__' before 'pysqlite_NodeType'
src/cache.h:62: error: expected '=', ',', ';', 'asm' or '__attribute__' before 'pysqlite_CacheType'

src/cache.h:67: error: expected declaration specifiers or '...' before 'PyObject'

</code></pre>

<p>Installing <strong>python-devel</strong> helped me too:</p>

<p><strong>yum install python-devel</strong></p>
