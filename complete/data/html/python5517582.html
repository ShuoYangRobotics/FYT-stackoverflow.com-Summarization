<h3>Question (ID-5517582):</h3><h2>Dangerous Python Keywords?</h2><p>I am about to get a bunch of python scripts from an untrusted source.</p>

<p>I'd like to be sure that no part of the code can hurt my system, meaning:</p>

<p><code>(1) the code is not allowed to import ANY MODULE</code></p>

<p><code>(2) the code is not allowed to read or write any data, connect to the network etc</code></p>

<p>(the purpose of each script is to loop through a list, compute some data from input given to it and return the computed value)</p>

<p>before I execute such code, I'd like to have a script 'examine' it and make sure that there's nothing dangerous there that could hurt my system.</p>

<p>I thought of using the following approach: <code>check that the word 'import' is not used (so we are guaranteed that no modules are imported)</code></p>

<p>yet, it would still be possible for the user (if desired) to write code to read/write files etc (say, using <code>open</code>). </p>

<p>Then here comes the question:</p>

<p>(1) where can I get a 'global' list of python methods (like <code>open</code>)? </p>

<p>(2) Is there some code that I could add to each script that is sent to me (at the top) that would make some 'global' methods invalid for that script (for example, any use of the keyword <code>open</code> would lead to an exception)?</p>

<p>I know that there are some solutions of python sandboxing. but please try to answer this question as I feel this is the more relevant approach for my needs.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> suppose that I make sure that no <code>import</code> is in the file, and that no possible hurtful methods (such as <code>open</code>, <code>eval</code>, etc) are in it. can I conclude that the file is SAFE? (can you think of any other 'dangerous' ways that built-in methods can be run?)</p>

  <p><strong>You are not going to be able to secure arbitrary Python code.</strong></p>

<p>A VM is the way to go unless you want security issues up the wazoo.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I'd check for <code>eval()</code> first, as you can obfuscate <code>import</code> with it. <code>eval()</code> evaluates code, so you can run this code:</p>

<pre><code>eval('imp{0}rt os'.format('o')) # 'imp{0}rt os'.format('o') -&gt; 'import os'
</code></pre>

<p>Which imports the <code>os</code> module <em>without</em> explicitly having the <code>import</code> statement within the script. But as @MK suggested in his comment, use a sandboxed Python installation. If something breaks, it's inside of the "box", not your system.</p>

<p>I'd look into PyPy's sandboxing capabilities here, as I've heard good stuff about it: <a href="http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/sandbox.html" rel="nofollow">http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/sandbox.html</a>.</p>

<p>But to be completely assured that you're not going to have any troubles whatsoever, run a Virtual Machine within your computer. A Virtual Machine is a completely isolated operating system installation within your normal operating system: for example, you can run Mac OS X from <em>within</em> Ubuntu Linux, and they are completely isolated from one another.</p>

<p>Basically, it's just a miniature screen within a window (man, am I going overkill with this VM thing):</p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/rdUsO.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>I'd suggest <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/" rel="nofollow">VirtualBox</a>, as it's free and really simple to setup. The only downside to virtualizing an OS is that you actually have to <em>install</em> the operating system into the virtual machine, which takes as much time as installing the operating system onto a normal computer.</p>

<p>Either way, it's up to you, but if you're worried about security, virtualizing is the way to go.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You can still obfuscate <code>import</code> without using <code>eval</code>:</p>

<pre><code>s = '__imp'
s += 'ort__'
f = globals()['__builtins__'].__dict__[s]
** BOOM **
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p><a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#built-in-functions" rel="nofollow">Built-in functions</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords" rel="nofollow">Keywords</a>.</p>

<p>Note that you'll need to do things like look for both "file" and "open", as both can open files.</p>

<p>Also, as others have noted, this isn't 100% certain to stop someone determined to insert malacious code.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Use a Virtual Machine instead of running it on a system that you are concerned about.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>An approach that should work better than string matching us to use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/ast.html" rel="nofollow">module ast</a>, parse the python code, do your whitelist filtering on the tree (e.g. allow only basic operations), then compile and run the tree.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://www.dalkescientific.com/writings/diary/archive/2010/02/22/instrumenting_the_ast.html" rel="nofollow">this nice example</a> by Andrew Dalke on manipulating ASTs.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>What's great about Python code is how readable it is. It's also probably safe to say you can open the code up in a text editor and read it.</p>

<p>I think the best way to better your understanding of python, and to catch malicious code from being executed, is to read the code and try to understand what it is doing. If there is a strange module you have never heard of check out the python documentation -- it's awesome!</p>

<p>@kriegar also suggested running the code in a VM which is a great idea if you're still wary of it.</p>

<p>TIP: if there is a standard lib module that you don't understand, open up the python interpreter and import it, then type <code>help(nameofmodule)</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import csv
&gt;&gt;&gt; help(csv)
Help on module csv:

NAME
    csv - CSV parsing and writing.

FILE
    c:\python27\lib\csv.py

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides classes that assist in the reading and writing
    of Comma Separated Value (CSV) files, and implements the interface
    described by PEP 305.  Although many CSV files are simple to parse,
    the format is not formally defined by a stable specification and
    is subtle enough that parsing lines of a CSV file with something
    like line.split(",") is bound to fail.  The module supports three
    basic APIs: reading, writing, and registration of dialects...
