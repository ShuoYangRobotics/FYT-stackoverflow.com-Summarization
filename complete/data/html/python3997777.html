<h3>Question (ID-3997777):</h3><h2>what would be a quick way to read a property file in python?</h2><p>I have a file with the format</p>

<pre><code>VarName=Value
.
.
</code></pre>

<p>I want to read it into a hash such that <code>H("VarName")</code> will return the value.</p>

<p>What would be a quick way? (read a set of strings, split all of them where the equality sign is, and then put it into a hash?</p>

<p>I am working with python.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><pre><code>d = {}
with open('filename') as f:
    for line in f:
        key, value = line.split('=')
        d[key] = value
</code></pre>

<p>Edit:
As suggested by foret, you could change it to</p>

<pre><code>    for line in f:
        tokens = line.split('=')
        d[tokens[0]] = '='.join(tokens[1:])
</code></pre>

<p>which would handle the case where equals signs were allowed in the value, but would still fail if the name could have equals signs as well -- for that you would need a true parser.</p>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The oneliner answer:</p>

<pre><code>H = dict(line.strip().split('=') for line in open('filename.txt'))
</code></pre>

<p>(optionally use <code>.split()</code> with <code>maxsplit=1</code> if the values could also contain the "=" character)</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>this may be a stupid answer but who know maybe it can help you :)</p>

<p>change the extension of your file to .py, and do necessary change like this:</p>

<p>file.py</p>

<pre><code>VarName="Value"   # if it's a string
VarName_2=1
# and you can also assign a dict a list to a var, how cool is that ?
</code></pre>

<p>and put it in your package tree or in sys.path, and now you can call it like this in the script when you want to use it:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import file
&gt;&gt;&gt; file.VarName
'Value'
</code></pre>

<p>why i'm writing this answer it's because ,what the hell is this file ? i never see a conf file like this , no section no nothing ? why you want to create a config file like this ? it look like a bad config file that should look like the Django settings, and i prefer using a django setting-like config file when ever i can.</p>

<p>Now you can put your -1 in the left :)</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>The <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow">csv module</a> will let you do this easily enough:</p>

<pre><code>import csv
H = dict([(row[0], row[1]) for row in csv.reader(open("the_file", "r"), delimiter="=" )])
</code></pre>
