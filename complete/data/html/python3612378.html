<h3>Question (ID-3612378):</h3><h2>can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'float'</h2><p>level: beginner</p>

<p>why do i get error "can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'float'"? </p>

<pre><code>def nestEgVariable(salary, save, growthRates):
    SavingsRecord = []
    fund = 0
    depositPerYear = salary * save * 0.01
    for i in growthRates:  
        fund = fund * (1 + 0.01 * growthRates) + depositPerYear
        SavingsRecord += [fund,]
    return SavingsRecord 


print nestEgVariable(10000,10,[3,4,5,0,3])
</code></pre>

<p>thanks

<p>should be:</p>

<pre><code>for i in growthRates:  
    fund = fund * (1 + 0.01 * i) + depositPerYear
</code></pre>

<p>You are multiplying 0.01 with the growthRates list object.  Multiplying a list by an integer is valid (it's overloaded syntactic sugar that allows you to create an extended a list with copies of its element references).</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 * [1,2]
[1, 2, 1, 2]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You're multipling your "1 + 0.01" times the growthRate list, not the item in the list you're iterating through.  I've renamed <code>i</code> to <code>rate</code> and using that instead.  See the updated code below:</p>

<pre><code>def nestEgVariable(salary, save, growthRates):
    SavingsRecord = []
    fund = 0
    depositPerYear = salary * save * 0.01
    #    V-- rate is a clearer name than i here, since you're iterating through the rates contained in the growthRates list
    for rate in growthRates:  
        #                           V-- Use the `rate` item in the growthRate list you're iterating through rather than multiplying by the `growthRate` list itself.
        fund = fund * (1 + 0.01 * rate) + depositPerYear
        SavingsRecord += [fund,]
    return SavingsRecord 


print nestEgVariable(10000,10,[3,4,5,0,3])

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>In this line:</p>

<p><code>fund = fund * (1 + 0.01 * growthRates) + depositPerYear</code></p>

<p>growthRates is a sequence (<code>[3,4,5,0,3]</code>). You can't multiply that sequence by a float (0.1). It looks like what you wanted to put there was <code>i</code>.</p>

<p>Incidentally, <code>i</code> is not a great name for that variable. Consider something more descriptive, like <code>growthRate</code> or <code>rate</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>In this line:</p>

<pre><code>fund = fund * (1 + 0.01 * growthRates) + depositPerYear
</code></pre>

<p>I think you mean this:</p>

<pre><code>fund = fund * (1 + 0.01 * i) + depositPerYear
</code></pre>

<p>When you try to multiply a float by growthRates (which is a list), you get that error.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Because growthRates is a sequence (you're even iterating it!) and you multiply it by (1 + 0.01), which is obviously a float (1.01). I guess you mean <code>for growthRate in growthRates: ... * growthrate</code>?</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Python allows for you to multiply sequences to repeat their values.  Here is a visual example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; [1] * 5
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
</code></pre>

<p>But it does not allow you to do it with floating point numbers:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; [1] * 5.1
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'float'
</code></pre>
