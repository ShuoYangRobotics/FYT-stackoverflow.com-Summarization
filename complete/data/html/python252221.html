<h3>Question (ID-252221):</h3><h2>Possible Google Riddle?</h2><p>My friend was given this free google website optimizer tshirt and came to me to try and figure out what the front logo meant.</p>

<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_iQVgmEEAit4/SPkKHA3e8fI/AAAAAAAAAB8/ugUerJjuBw8/s1600-h/GWO-tshirt.jpg" rel="nofollow">t-shirt</a></p>

<p>So, I have a couple of guesses as to what it means, but I was just wondering if there is something more.</p>

<p>My first guess is that each block represents a page layout, and the logo "You should test that" just means that you should use google website optimizer to test which is the best layout.  I hope that this isn't the answer, it just seems to simple and unsatisfying.</p>

<p>Well, I've spent the past hour trying to figure out if there is any deeper meaning, but to no avail.  So, I'm here hoping that someone might be able to help.</p>

<p>I did though write a program to see if the blocks represent something in binary.  I'll post the code below.  My code tests every permutation of reading a block as 4 bits, and then tries to interpret these bits as letters, hex, and ip addresses.</p>

<p>I hope someone knows better.</p>

<pre><code>#This code interprets the google t-shirt as a binary code, each box 4 bits.
# I try every permutation of counting the bits and then try to interpret these
# interpretations as letters, or hex numbers, or ip addresses.

# I need more interpretations, maybe one will find a pattern

import string

#these represent the boxes binary codes from left to right top to bottom

                "4123", "4132", "4213", "4231","4312", "4321"]

<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I emailed the Website Optimizer Team, and they said "There's no secret code, unless you find one. :)"</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I think Google are just trying to drive their point home - here are a bunch of different representations of the same page, test them, see which is best.</p>

<p>Which block do you like best?</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I think it's <em>simply</em> a design, nothing secret, or mysterious.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>What if it doesn't mean anything, what if it is just a neat design they came up with?</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Well, I can't see an immediate pattern. But if you are testing IP, why not take two blocks of 4 as a single binary number.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Probably it's a base 4 notation?</p>

<p>I would try that, but I don't have any approach to this.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>It reminded me of cellular automata:</p>

<p>Anyone going that direction?</p>
