<h3>Question (ID-614518):</h3><h2>Tool/library for calculating intervals like "last thursday of the month"</h2><p>I'm looking for a command line tool or some sort of python library (that I can then wrap), so that I can calculate dates that are specified like "last thursday of the month".</p>

<p>i.e. I want to let people enter human friendly text like that above and it should be able to calculate all the dates for any month/year/whatever that fulfil that.</p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Neither mxDateTime nor Datejs nor that webservice support "last thursday of the month". The OP wants to know all of the last thursdays of the month for, say, a full year.</p>

<p>mxDateTime supports the operations, but the question must be posed in Python code, not as a string.</p>

<p>The best I could figure is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/parsedatetime/" rel="nofollow">parsedatetime</a>, but that doesn't support "last thursday of the month". It does support:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; c.parseDateText("last thursday of april 2001")
(2001, 4, 20, 13, 55, 58, 3, 64, 0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; c.parseDateText("last thursday of may 2001")
(2001, 5, 20, 13, 56, 3, 3, 64, 0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; c.parseDateText("last thursday of may 2010")
(2010, 5, 20, 13, 56, 7, 3, 64, 0)
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>(Note that neither DateJS nor that web service support this syntax.)</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Umm, okay, but while the year and the month are right, the day isn't. The last thursday of april 2001 was the 27th. I think you're going to have to roll your own solution here.</p>

<p>It does not support:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; c.parseDateText("last thursday of 2010")
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  File "parsedatetime/parsedatetime.py", line 411, in parseDateText
    mth = self.ptc.MonthOffsets[mth]
KeyError
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So one possibility is text substitution: normalize the string to lowercase, single spaces, etc. then do a string substitution of "the month" for each of the months you're interested in.  You'll likely have to tweak any solution you find. For example, in some <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050309211440/manatee.mojam.com/~skip/python/dates.py" rel="nofollow">old code of Skip Montanaro</a> which he wrote for an online music calendering system:</p>

<pre><code>     # someone keeps submitting dates with september spelled wrong...
     'septmber':9,
</code></pre>

<p>Or you write your own parser on top of mxDateTime, using all of the above links as references.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I think you can get pretty far using just Python's standard <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/calendar.html#module-calendar" rel="nofollow">calendar</a> module, maybe by adding some "human-friendly" methods on top of those methods. The module gives you iterators for dates, while taking weeks into consideration, and so on.</p>

<p>First I guess you must answer the question "what are some human-friendly ways to talk about dates?", which I guess is more than half the difficulty of this problem.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>The algorithms aren't hard.  They're provided in the following book, which is worth every penny.</p>

<p><a href="http://emr.cs.iit.edu/home/reingold/calendar-book/third-edition/" rel="nofollow">http://emr.cs.iit.edu/home/reingold/calendar-book/third-edition/</a></p>

<p>The general approach is to find first days of a required month.  You can then subtract one day to find the last day of a required month.  Then you compute an offset for day of week you want relative to the day of the week you found.</p>

<p>Assume you have a <code>datetime.dat</code>e, <code>d</code>.  You can work out the end of the month by computing the start of the next month minus one day.</p>

<pre><code>monIx= d.year*12 + (d.month-1) + 1
endOfMonth= datetime.date( monIx//12, monIx%12+1, 1 ) - datetime.timedelta( days=1 )
</code></pre>

<p>At this point, you're looking for an offset to the required day of the week.  In this case, the desired day of the week is Thursday, which is <code>3</code>.</p>

<pre><code>dayOffset =  ((3 - endOfMonth.weekday()) -7 ) % -7 
lastDay = endOfMonth + datetime.timedelta( days=dayOffset )
</code></pre>

<p>The general approach of getting the day-of-week offset requires a little bit of thinking, but there are only a few combinations of cases to experiment with.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I'm not entirely sure, but you might look at the Python <a href="http://labix.org/python-dateutil" rel="nofollow">DateUtil</a> module.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Well, don't know if such library exists, but <code>date</code> from GNU coreutils has something like that:</p>

<pre><code>$ date -d "last monday"
Mon Mar  2 00:00:00 RST 2009
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Use <strong>mxDateTime</strong>. <a href="http://www.egenix.com/products/python/mxBase/mxDateTime/" rel="nofollow">http://www.egenix.com/products/python/mxBase/mxDateTime/</a></p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>If this is for a web app take a look at <a href="http://www.datejs.com/" rel="nofollow">Datejs</a>, it may be easier to use that in your form then just pass it's date object's value to Python.</p>

<p>If you end up writing one yourself the source may be helpful too.</p>
