<h3>Question (ID-237699):</h3><h2>How do I parse a listing of files to get just the filenames in python?</h2><p>So lets say I'm using Python's <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/lib/module-ftplib.html" rel="nofollow">ftplib</a> to retrieve a list of log files from an FTP server. How would I parse that list of files to get just the file names (the last column) inside a list? See the link above for example output.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Using retrlines() probably isn't the best idea there, since it just prints to the console and so you'd have to do tricky things to even get at that output. A likely better bet would be to use the nlst() method, which returns exactly what you want: a list of the file names.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Is there any reason why <strong>ftplib.FTP.nlst()</strong> won't work for you? I just checked and it returns only names of the files in a given directory.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><h2>This best answer</h2>

<p>You may want to use ftp.nlst() instead of ftp.retrlines(). It will give you exactly what you want.</p>

<p>If you cant, read the following :</p>

<h2>Generators for sysadmin processes</h2>

<p>In his now famous review, <a href="http://www.dabeaz.com/generators/Generators.pdf" rel="nofollow">Generator Tricks For Systems Programmers An Introduction</a>, David M. Beazley gives a lot of receipes to answer to this kind of data problem with wuick and reusable code.</p>

<p>E.G :</p>

<pre><code># empty list that will receive all the log entry
log = [] 
# we pass a callback function bypass the print_line that would be called by retrlines
# we do that only because we cannot use something better than retrlines
ftp.retrlines('LIST', callback=log.append)
# we use rsplit because it more efficient in our case if we have a big file
files = (line.rsplit(None, 1)[1] for line in log)
# get you file list
files_list = list(files)
</code></pre>

<p>Why don't we generate immediately the list ?</p>

<p>Well, it's because doing it this way offer you much flexibility : you can apply any intermediate generator to filter files before turning it into files_list : it's just like pipe, add a line, you add a process without overheat (since it's generators). And if you get rid off retrlines, it still work be it's even better because you don't store the liste even one time.</p>

<p>EDIT : well, I read the comment to the other answer and it says that this won't work if there is any space in the name.</p>

<p>Cool, this will illustrate why this method is handy. If you want to change something in the process, you just change a line. Swap :</p>

<pre><code>files = (line.rsplit(None, 1)[1] for line in log)
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code># join split the line, get all the item from the field 8 then join them
files = (' '.join(line.split()[8:]) for line in log)
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, this may no be obvious here, but for huge batch process scripts, it's nice :-)</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I believe it should work for you.</p>

<pre><code>file_name_list = [' '.join(each_file.split()).split()[-1] for each_file_detail in file_list_from_log]
</code></pre>

<p>NOTES - </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Here I am making a assumption that you want the data in the program (as list), not on console.</p></li>
<li><p>each_file_detail is each line that is being produced by the program.</p></li>
<li><p>' '.join(each_file.split())</p></li>
</ol>

<p>To replace multiple spaces by 1 space.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>And a slightly less-optimal method, by the way, if you're stuck using retrlines() for some reason, is to pass a function as the second argument to retrlines(); it'll be called for each item in the list. So something like this (assuming you have an FTP object named 'ftp') would work as well:</p>

<pre><code>filenames = []
ftp.retrlines('LIST', lambda line: filenames.append(line.split()[-1]))
</code></pre>

<p>The list 'filenames' will then be a list of the file names.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Since every filename in the output starts at the same column, all you have to do is get the position of the dot on the first line:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>drwxrwsr-x   5 ftp-usr  pdmaint     1536 Mar 20 09:48 .</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then slice the filename out of the other lines using the position of that dot as the starting index.</p>

<p>Since the dot is the last character on the line, you can use the length of the line minus 1 as the index. So the final code is something like this:</p>

<pre><code>lines = ftp.retrlines('LIST')
lines = lines.split("\n") # This should split the string into an array of lines

filename_index = len(lines[0]) - 1
files = []

for line in lines:
    files.append(line[filename_index:])
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>If the FTP server supports the <code>MLSD</code> command, then please see section “single directory case” from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2867217/how-to-delete-files-with-a-python-script-from-a-ftp-server-which-are-older-than-7/3114477#3114477">that</a> answer.</p>

<p>Use an instance (say <code>ftpd</code>) of the <code>FTPDirectory</code> class, call its <code>.getdata</code> method with connected <code>ftplib.FTP</code> instance in the correct folder, then you can:</p>

<pre><code>directory_filenames= [ftpfile.name for ftpfile in ftpd.files]
</code></pre>
