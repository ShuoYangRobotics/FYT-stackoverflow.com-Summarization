<h3>Question (ID-320052):</h3><h2>How do you iterate over a tree?</h2><p>What is you preferred method of traversing a tree data structure, since recursive method calls can be pretty inefficient in some circumstances, I am simply using a generator like the one above. Do you have any hints to make it faster ?</p>

<pre><code>def children(self):
    stack = [self.entities]
    while stack: 
        for e in stack.pop():
            yield e
            if e.entities:
                stack.append(e.entities)
</code></pre>

<p>here is some test data:
first one is recursive, second uses the generator</p>

<pre><code>s = time.time()
for i in range(100000):
    e.inc_counter()
print time.time() - s

s = time.time()
for i in range(100000):
    for e in e.children():
        e.inc_counter_s()
print time.time() - s

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I can't think of any big algorithmic improvements, but a simple microoptimisation you can make is to bind frequently called methods (such as stack.append / stack.pop) to locals (this saves a dictionary lookup)</p>

<pre><code>def children(self):
    stack = [self.entities]
    push = stack.append
    pop = stack.pop
    while stack: 
        for e in pop():
            yield e
            if e.entities:
                push(e.entities)
</code></pre>

<p>This gives a small (~15%) speedup by my tests (using 100 traversals of an 8-deep tree with 4 children at each node gives me the below timings:)</p>

<pre><code>children     :  5.53942348004
children_bind:  4.77636131253
</code></pre>

<p>Not huge, but worth doing if speed is important.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I'm not sure if you can reduce the overhead much on a <em>full</em> in-order traversal of a tree, if you use recursion the call stack will grow some, otherwise you must manually use a stack to push references of the children while visiting each node. Which way is fastest and uses less memory, depends on the expensiveness of the call stack vs. a normal stack. (I would guess the callstack is faster since it should be optimized for its use, and recursion is much easier to implement)</p>

<p>If you don't care about the order you visit the nodes, some implementations of trees is actually stored in a dynamic array or linked list or stack wich you can traverse linearly if you don't care about the order it's traversed.</p>

<p>But why is it important to have a fast traversal anyway? Trees are good for searching, arrays/linked lists is good for full traversal. If you often need full in-order traversal but few searches and insertions/deletions, an ordered linked list might be best, if searching is what you do most you use a tree. If the data is really massive, so that memory overhead may render recursion impossible, you should use a database.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Recursive function calls are not incredibly inefficient, that is an old programming myth. (If they're badly implemented, they may incur a larger overhead than necessary, but calling them "incredibly inefficient" is plain wrong.)</p>

<p>Remember: don't optimize prematurely, and <em>never</em> optimize without benchmarking first.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>If you have a lot of RAM and the tree doesn't change often, you can cache the result of the call:</p>

<pre><code>def children(self):
    if self._children_cache is not None:
        return self._children_cache
    # Put your code into collectChildren()
    self._children_cache = self.collectChildren()
    return self._children_cache
</code></pre>

<p>Whenever the tree changes, set the cache to None. In this case, using recursive calls might be more effective since the results will accumulate faster.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I've written iterative tree-traversal code in the past: it's very ugly, and not fast, unless you know <em>exactly</em> how many children not only each subtree will have, but how many levels there are.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I don't know too much about Python internals of function calls, but I really can't imagine that your code snippet is faster than recursively traversing the tree.</p>

<p>The call stack (used for function calls, including recursive ones) is typically very fast. Going to the next object will only cost you a single function call. But in your snippet - where you use a stack object, going to the next object will cost you a stack.append (possibly allocating memory on heap), a stack.push (possibly freeing memory from heap), and a yield.</p>

<p>The main problem with recursive calls is that you might blow the stack if your tree gets too deep. This isn't likely to happen.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Here's a pair of small corrections.</p>

<pre><code>def children(self):
    stack = [self.entities]
    for e in stack:
        yield e
        if e.entities:
            stack.extend(e.entities)
</code></pre>

<p>I actually think the generator, using append, isn't visiting all the nodes. I think you mean to <code>extend</code> the stack with all entities, not <code>append</code> a simple list of entities to the stack.</p>

<p>Also, when the <code>for</code> loop terminates, the <code>while</code> loop in your original example will also terminate because there's no change to the empty stack after the <code>for</code> loop.</p>
