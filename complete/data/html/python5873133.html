<h3>Question (ID-5873133):</h3><h2>Python - Run a bash script for all files in a directory</h2><p>I am creating a Python script to act as a wrapper for some common image-related tasks that I have to do, and here's a part where I am stuck at:</p>

<p>There is a Bash script someone wrote for ImageMagick which is located here:  <a href="http://www.fmwconcepts.com/imagemagick/autocolor/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.fmwconcepts.com/imagemagick/autocolor/index.php</a></p>

<p>Essentially, it can only operate on a single file (I cannot pass *.jpg to it, (it fails when I do so) otherwise I wouldn't have this problem) so I need Python to run this line on every file:</p>

<p>~/autocolor.sh -m " + ColorMethod + " -c " + WorkingDirectory + InputFileName + " " + WorkingDirectory + OutputFileName</p>

<p>This is my current block of code:</p>

<pre><code>elif RetouchOption == "04":
    ColorMethod = input("What method will you use (options are gamma, recolor, none)?: ")
    ClipMode = input("What clipping mode will you use (options are together or separate)?: ")
    for f in WorkingDirectory + "*.jpg":
        do
        os.system("sh ~/autocolor.sh -m " + ColorMethod + " -c " + WorkingDirectory + FileName + " " + WorkingDirectory + FileName)
</code></pre>

<p>WorkingDirectory is already established as a variable, and ColorMethod and ClipMode are established in that block.  What I need to do is get a FileName variable (or some other way to make this code work).</p>

<p>Thanks for the help!  Let me know if I didn't supply enough information.  I heard os.system is not the preferred way of doing something like this, but it seems to work well so far in executing other commands I have in the same script, so I'll tackle changing that over at another time.</p>

<pre><code>from glob import glob
import subprocess

elif RetouchOption == "04":
    ColorMethod = input("What method will you use (options are gamma, recolor, none)?: ")
    ClipMode = input("What clipping mode will you use (options are together or separate)?: ")
    script = ["sh", "~/autocolor.sh"]
    method = "-m %s" % ColorMethod
    clipmode = "-c %s" % ClipMode
    for filename in glob("*.jpg"):
        subprocess.call(script + [method, clipmode, filename, filename])
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://docs.python.org/library/glob.html" rel="nofollow">glob</a> is great, and <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/subprocess.html" rel="nofollow">subprocess</a> is preferred over os.system as you surmised.</p>

<p>Note that glob without your WorkingDirectory uses the 'current working directory of the script'. To make it use WorkingDirectory, try something like this:</p>

<pre><code>import os

for filename in glob(os.path.join(WorkingDirectory, '*.jpg')):
    ...
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Isn't it better to use bash?<pre><code>for f in *.jpg; do ./autocolor.sh $f; done</code></pre></p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><pre><code>for f in glob.glob('*.jpg'):
    do_something() 
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>This is a suggestion for coding. I write a lot of Python code that works with MySQL. I have found it helpful as a debugging aid to create the string in a variable and print it out, so you can see what the script is doing. </p>

<p>You will do well with earlier answers to your question. They are quite helpful.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Have you considered using <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/os.html" rel="nofollow"><code>os.listdir</code></a> to get all the files in the directory?</p>

<p>Once you have a listing of all files in the directory, you can pull out all the JPGs and use the following code to to remove the ".jpg" from the end of the filename:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; f = 'firstPic.jpg'
&gt;&gt;&gt; f. replace(".jpg", '')
'firstPic'
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>The Python glob module makes it easy to create lists that match a pattern.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>    import glob
    glob.glob("*txt")
</code></pre>

<p>The above code would return a list of all "txt" files in the current directory.</p>
