<h3>Question (ID-1120927):</h3><h2>Which is better in python, del or delattr?</h2><p>This may be silly, but its been nagging the back of my brain for a while. </p>

<p>So Python gives us two built-in ways to delete attributes from objects, the <strong>del</strong> command word and the <strong>delattr</strong> built-in function. I prefer <strong>delattr</strong> because it I think its a bit more explicit:</p>

<pre><code>del foo.bar
delattr(foo, "bar")
</code></pre>

<p>But I'm wondering if there might be under-the-hood differences between them.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The first is more efficient than the second.  <code>del foo.bar</code> compiles to two bytecode instructions:</p>

<pre><code>  2           0 LOAD_FAST                0 (foo)
              3 DELETE_ATTR              0 (bar)
</code></pre>

<p>whereas <code>delattr(foo, "bar")</code> takes five:</p>

<pre><code>  2           0 LOAD_GLOBAL              0 (delattr)
              3 LOAD_FAST                0 (foo)
              6 LOAD_CONST               1 ('bar')
              9 CALL_FUNCTION            2
             12 POP_TOP
</code></pre>

<p>This translates into the first running <em>slightly</em> faster (but it's not a huge difference – .15 μs on my machine).</p>

<p>Like the others have said, you should really only use the second form when the attribute that you're deleting is determined dynamically.</p>

<p>[Edited to show the bytecode instructions generated inside a function, where the compiler can use <code>LOAD_FAST</code> and <code>LOAD_GLOBAL</code>]</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Unquestionably the former.  In my view this is like asking whether foo.bar is better than getattr(foo, "bar"), and I don't think anyone is asking that question :)</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>It's really a matter of preference, but the first is probably preferable.  I'd only use the second one if you don't know the name of the attribute that you're deleting ahead of time.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>It's the same thing, they both end up calling the objects <code>__delattr__</code> method. delattr is for when the attribute name is in a variable: <code>delattr(theob, foo)</code>. Otherwise, using delattr is like crossing the stream for water. </p>

<p>In short: Use del.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Just like getattr and setattr, delattr should only be used when the attribute name is unknown.</p>

<p>In that sense, it's roughly equivalent to several python features that are used to access built-in functionality at a lower level than you normally have available, such as <code>__import__</code> instead of <code>import</code> and <code>operator.add</code> instead of <code>+</code></p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>If you think delattr is more explicit, then why not used getattr all the time rather than object.attr?</p>

<p>As for under the hood... your guess is as good as mine. If not significantly better.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Not sure about the inner workings, but from a code reusability and don't be a jerk coworker perspective, use del. It's more clear and understood by people coming from other languages as well.</p>
