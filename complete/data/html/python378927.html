<h3>Question (ID-378927):</h3><h2>What is the best (idiomatic) way to check the type of a Python variable?</h2><p>I need to know if a variable in Python is a string or a dict.  Is there anything wrong with the following code?</p>

<pre><code>if type(x) == type(str()):
    do_something_with_a_string(x)
elif type(x) == type(dict()):
    do_somethting_with_a_dict(x)
else:
    raise ValueError
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I accepted avisser's answer (though I will change my mind if someone explains why isinstance is preferred over "type(x) is").</p>

<p>But thanks to nakedfanatic for reminding me that it's often cleaner to use a dict (as a "case statement) than an if/elif/else series.</p>

<p>Let me elaborate on my use case.  If a variable is a string, I need to put it in a list.  If it's a dict, I need a list of the unique values.  Here's what I came up with:</p>

<pre><code>def value_list(x):
    cases = {str: lambda t: [t],
             dict: lambda t: list(set(t.values()))}
    try:
        return cases[type(x)](x)
    except KeyError:
        return None
</code></pre>

<p>If isinstance is prefered, how would you write this value_list() function?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-10):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>What happens if somebody passes a unicode string to your function? Or a class derived from dict? Or a class implementing a dict-like interface? Following code covers first two cases. If you are using Python 2.6 you might want to use <code>collections.Mapping</code> instead of <code>dict</code> as per the <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3119/" rel="nofollow">ABC PEP</a>.</p>

<pre><code>def value_list(x):
    if isinstance(x, dict):
        return list(set(x.values()))
    elif isinstance(x, basestring):
        return [x]
    else:
        return None
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>"type(dict())" says "make a new dict, and then find out what its type is".  It's quicker to say just "dict".</p>

<p>But if you want to just check type, a more idiomatic way is isinstance(x, dict).</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>built-in types in Python have built in names:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s = "hallo"
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(s) is str
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; s = {}
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(s) is dict
True
</code></pre>

<p>btw note the <em>is</em> operator. However, type checking (if you want to call it that) is usually done by wrapping a type-specific test in a try-except clause, as it's not so much the type of the variable that's important, but whether you can do a certain something with it or not.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p><code>*sigh*</code></p>

<p>No, typechecking arguments in python is not necessary. It is <strong>never</strong> 
necessary.</p>

<p>If your code accepts either a string or a dict object, your design is broken.</p>

<p>That comes from the fact that if you don't know already the type of an object
in your own program, then you're doing something wrong already.</p>

<p>Typechecking hurts code reuse and reduces performance. Having a function that
performs different things depending on the type of the object passed is 
bug-prone and has a behavior harder to understand and maintain.</p>

<p>You have the following saner options:</p>

<p>1) Make a function <code>unique_values</code> that converts dicts in unique lists of values:</p>

<pre><code>def unique_values(some_dict):
    return list(set(some_dict.values()))
</code></pre>

<p>Make your function assume the argument passed is always a list. That way, if you need to pass a string to the function, you just do:</p>

<pre><code>myfunction([some_string])
</code></pre>

<p>If you need to pass it a dict, you do:</p>

<pre><code>myfunction(unique_values(some_dict))
</code></pre>

<p>That's your best option, it is clean, easy to understand and maintain. Anyone
reading the code immediatelly understands what is happening, and you don't have
to typecheck.</p>

<p>2) Make two functions, one that accepts lists of strings and one that accepts 
dicts. You can make one call the other internally, in the most convenient 
way (<code>myfunction_dict</code> can create a list of strings and call <code>myfunction_list</code>).</p>

<p>In any case, <strong>don't typecheck</strong>. It is completely unnecessary and has only 
downsides. Refactor your code instead in a way you don't need to typecheck. 
You only get benefits in doing so, both in short and long run.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>isinstance is preferrable over type because it also evaluates as True when you compare an object instance with it's superclass, which basically means you won't ever have to special-case your old code for using it with dict or str subclasses.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code> &gt;&gt;&gt; class a_dict(dict):
 ...     pass
 ... 
 &gt;&gt;&gt; type(a_dict()) == type(dict())
 False
 &gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance(a_dict(), dict)
 True
 &gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, there might be situations where you wouldn't want this behavior, but those are –hopefully– a lot less common than situations where you do want it.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I think it might be preferred to actually do</p>

<pre><code>if isinstance(x, str):
    do_something_with_a_string(x)
elif isinstance(x, dict):
    do_somethting_with_a_dict(x)
else:
    raise ValueError
</code></pre>

<p>2 Alternate forms, depending on your code one or the other is probably considered better than that even.  One is to not look before you leap</p>

<pre><code>try:
  one, two = tupleOrValue
except TypeError:
  one = tupleOrValue
  two = None
</code></pre>

<p>The other approach is from Guido and is a form of function overloading which leaves your code more open ended.</p>

<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I think I will go for the duck typing approach - "if it walks like a duck, it quacks like a duck, its a duck". This way you will need not worry about if the string is a unicode or ascii. </p>

<p>Here is what I will do:</p>

<pre><code>In [53]: s='somestring'

In [54]: u=u'someunicodestring'

In [55]: d={}

In [56]: for each in s,u,d:
    if hasattr(each, 'keys'):
        print list(set(each.values()))
    elif hasattr(each, 'lower'):
        print [each]
    else:
        print "error"
   ....:         
   ....:         
['somestring']
[u'someunicodestring']
[]
</code></pre>

<p>The experts here are welcome to comment on this type of usage of ducktyping, I have been using it but got introduced to the exact concept behind it lately and am very excited about it. So I would like to know if thats an overkill to do.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>You may want to check out typecheck.
<a href="http://oakwinter.com/code/typecheck/" rel="nofollow">http://oakwinter.com/code/typecheck/</a></p>

<p>Type-checking module for Python</p>

<p>This package provides powerful run-time typechecking facilities for Python functions, methods and generators. Without requiring a custom preprocessor or alterations to the language, the typecheck package allows programmers and quality assurance engineers to make precise assertions about the input to, and output from, their code.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>That should work - so no, there is nothing wrong with your code. However, it could also be done with a dict:</p>

<pre><code>{type(str()): do_something_with_a_string,
 type(dict()): do_something_with_a_dict}.get(type(x), errorhandler)()
</code></pre>

<p>A bit more concise and pythonic wouldn't you say?</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>Edit.. Heeding Avisser's advice, the code also works like this, and looks nicer:</p>

<pre><code>{str: do_something_with_a_string,
 dict: do_something_with_a_dict}.get(type(x), errorhandler)()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>I've been using a different approach:</p>

<pre><code>from inspect import getmro
if (type([]) in getmro(obj.__class__)):
    # This is a list, or a subclass of...
elif (type{}) in getmro(obj.__class__)):
    # This one is a dict, or ...
</code></pre>

<p>I can't remember why I used this instead of isinstance, though...</p>
