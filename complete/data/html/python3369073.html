<h3>Question (ID-3369073):</h3><h2>Controlling Browser using Python?</h2><p>Is it possible to control a web browser like Firefox using Python? </p>

<p>I would want to do things like </p>

<ul>
<li>launch the browser</li>
<li>force clicks on URLs</li>

<p>etc.</p>

I don't know if you can force it to take screenshots, I'm fairly certain that is behaviour controlled by a window manager. </p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>If you need to take screenshots, then you need to render the pages. I would recommend to use Selenium (as mentioned by Tim), or then <a href="http://code.google.com/p/spynner/" rel="nofollow">spynner</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a sample code of what you need using spynner:</p>

<pre><code>import spynner

browser = spynner.Browser()
browser.load("http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3369073/controlling-browser-using-python")
browser.snapshot().save('file.png')
browser.close()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.kirix.com/labs/wxwebconnect.html" rel="nofollow">wxWebConnect</a> is a wxWidgets library for controlling Gecko (Mozilla's rendering engine). Together with <a href="http://www.wxpython.org/" rel="nofollow">wxPython</a>, it would allow you to write your own (minimal) web browser in Python, and hence control clicks.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Ag great way to control a browser in Python is to use <code>PyQt4.QtWebKit</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Depends what do you actually want to achieve. If you need to do some automatic stuff w/out user interference, you can just use underlying engine of the browser, like Gecko or WebKit, w/out loading browser itself. There are ready Python bindings to these engines available.</p>

<p>Browsers themself do not provide this kind of API to outside processes. For Firefox, you would need to inject some browser-side code into chrome, either as extension or plugin.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>The question is a bit old but I see no references to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pywebkitgtk/" rel="nofollow">pywebkitgtk</a>, you should give it a try. I developed <a href="http://code.google.com/p/spynner/" rel="nofollow">spynner</a> using the <a href="http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/static/Docs/PyQt4/pyqt4ref.html" rel="nofollow">pyqt.qtwebkit</a> bindings, but programmers who prefer pygtk should try pywebketgtk (which feels more pythonic to me). Note though that Qt bindings are more complete (or at least it was last time I checked).</p>
