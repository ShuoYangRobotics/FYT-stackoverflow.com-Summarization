<h3>Question (ID-1279110):</h3><h2>What's the regex for removing dots in acronyms but not in domain names?</h2><p>I want to remove dots in acronyms but not in domain names in a python string. For example, 
I want the string</p>

<pre><code>'a.b.c. test@test.com http://www.test.com'
</code></pre>

<p>to become</p>

<pre><code>'abc test@test.com http://www.test.com'
</code></pre>

<p>The closest regex I made so far is</p>

<pre><code>re.sub('(?:\s|\A).{1}\.',lambda s: s.group()[0:2], s)
</code></pre>

<p>which results to</p>

<pre><code>'ab.c. test@test.com http://www.test.com'
</code></pre>

<p>It seems that for the above regex to work, I need to change the regex to</p>

<pre><code>(?:\s|\A|\G).{1}\.
</code></pre>

<p>but there is no end of match marker (\G) in python.</p>

<p>EDIT: As I have mentioned in my comment, the strings have no specific formatting. These strings contain informal human conversations and so may contain zero, one or several acronyms or domain names. A few errors is fine by me if it would save me from coding a "real" parser.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>If your data is always formatted like this then why not split your data into 3 parts by splitting on the space.</p>

<p>Then it's pretty trivial to remove the periods from the first element and use join to remerge the parts.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You could simply remove DOTS that don't have two [a-z] letters (or more) ahead of them:</p>

<pre><code>\.(?![a-zA-Z]{2})
</code></pre>

<p>But that will of course also remove the first DOT from the following address:</p>

<p>name.i@foo.bar</p>

<p>You could fix that by doing:</p>

<pre><code>\.(?![a-zA-Z]{2}|[^\s@]*+@)
</code></pre>

<p>but I'm sure there will be many more such corner cases.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I suggest you split the string at '@' (or whatever character makes sense), do the substitution on the first part, then put the string back together. I think that will show the intent of the code better than a complex regexp. Something like this, perhaps:</p>

<pre><code>string='a.b.c. test@test.com http://www.test.com'
left, rest = string.split("@",1)
left = left.replace(".","")
result="%s@%s" % (left, rest)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The following worked for me (with thanks to Bart for his answer):</p>

<pre><code>re.sub('\.(?!(\S[^. ])|\d)', '', s)
</code></pre>

<p>This will not remove a dot if it is the first character in a word or acronym. </p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>A non-regex way:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; S = 'a.b.c. test@test.com http://www.test.com'
&gt;&gt;&gt; ' '.join(w if '@' in w or ':' in w else w.replace('.', '') for w in S.split())
'abc test@test.com http://www.test.com'
</code></pre>

<p>(Requires spaces to split on, though - so if you had something like commas with no spaces it could miss some.)</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Not as elegant as a simple <code>re.sub()</code>, but try this:</p>

<pre><code>import re

s='a.b.c. test@test.com http://www.test.com'
m=re.search('(.*?)(([a-zA-Z]\.){2,})(.*)', s)

if m:
    replacement=''.join(m.group(2).split('.'))
    s=m.group(1)+replacement+m.group(4)

print s
</code></pre>

<p>It assumes that there's no more than one acronym per string, but you could always run it repeatedly.</p>
