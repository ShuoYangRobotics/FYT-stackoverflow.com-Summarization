<h3>Question (ID-156330):</h3><h2>Get timer ticks in Python</h2><p>I'm just trying to time a piece of code. The pseudocode looks like:</p>

<pre><code>start = get_ticks()
do_long_code()
print "It took " + (get_ticks() - start) + " seconds."
</code></pre>

<p>How does this look in Python?</p>

<p>More specifically, how do I get the number of ticks since midnight (or however Python organizes that timing)?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>What you need is <code>time()</code> function from <code>time</code> module:</p>

<pre><code>import time
start = time.time()
do_long_code()
print "it took", time.time() - start, "seconds."
</code></pre>

<p>You can use <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-timeit.html" rel="nofollow">timeit</a> module for more options though.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>In the <code>time</code> module, there are two timing functions: <code>time</code> and <code>clock</code>. <code>time</code> gives you "wall" time, if this is what you care about.</p>

<p>However, the python <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-time.html" rel="nofollow">docs</a> say that <code>clock</code> should be used for benchmarking. Note that <code>clock</code> behaves different in separate systems:</p>

<ul>
<li>on MS Windows, it uses the Win32 function QueryPerformanceCounter(), with "resolution typically better than a microsecond". It has no special meaning, it's just a number (it starts counting the first time you call <code>clock</code> in your process).</li>
</ul>

<pre>
    # ms windows
    t0= time.clock()
    do_something()
    t= time.clock() - t0 # t is wall seconds elapsed (floating point)
</pre>

<ul>
<li>on *nix, <code>clock</code> reports CPU time. Now, this is different, and most probably the value you want, since your program hardly ever is the only process requesting CPU time (even if you have no other processes, the kernel uses CPU time now and then). So, this number, which typically is smaller¹ than the wall time (i.e. time.time() - t0), is more meaningful when benchmarking code:</li>
</ul>

<pre>
    # linux
    t0= time.clock()
    do_something()
    t= time.clock() - t0 # t is CPU seconds elapsed (floating point)
</pre>

<p>Apart from all that, the <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-timeit.html" rel="nofollow">timeit</a> module has the <code>Timer</code> class that is supposed to use what's best for benchmarking from the available functionality.</p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><pre><code>import datetime

start = datetime.datetime.now()
do_long_code()
finish = datetime.datetime.now()
delta = finish - start
print delta.seconds
</code></pre>

<p>From midnight:</p>

<pre><code>import datetime

midnight = datetime.datetime.now().replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
now = datetime.datetime.now()
delta = now - midnight
print delta.seconds
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-time.html" rel="nofollow">time module</a> in python gives you access to the clock() function, which returns time in seconds as a floating point.</p>

<p>Different systems will have different accuracy based on their internal clock setup (ticks per second) but it's generally at least under 20milliseconds, and in some cases better than a few microseconds.</p>
