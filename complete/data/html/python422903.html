<h3>Question (ID-422903):</h3><h2>What's the most pythonic way of access C libraries - for example, OpenSSL?</h2><p>I need to access the crypto functions of OpenSSL to encode Blowfish data in a CBC streams. I've googled and found some Blowfish libraries (hand written) and some OpenSSL wrappers (none of the seem complete.)</p>

<p>In the end, I need to access the certain OpenSSL functions, such as the full blowfish.h library of <a href="http://www.openssl.org/docs/crypto/blowfish.html" rel="nofollow">commands</a>. What's the pythonic/right way of accessing them? Using something like SWIG to allow Python/C bindings, or is there a better way?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p><a href="http://docs.python.org/library/ctypes.html" rel="nofollow">ctypes</a> is the place to start.  It lets you call into DLLs, using C-declared types, etc.  I don't know if there are limitations that will keep you from doing everything you need, but it's very capable, and it's included in the standard library.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>There's lots of ways to interface with C (and C++) in Python. ctypes is pretty nice for quick little extensions, but it has a habit of turning would be compile time errors into runtime segfaults. If you're looking to write your own extension, SIP is very nice. SWIG is very general, but has a larger following. Of course, the first thing you should be doing is seeing if you really need to interface. Have you looked at PyCrypto?</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I was happy with M2Crypto (an OpenSSL wrapper) for blowfish.</p>

<pre><code>import M2Crypto
from M2Crypto import EVP
import base64
import struct

key = '0' * 16 # security FTW
iv = '' # initialization vector FTW
dummy_block =  ' ' * 8

encrypt = EVP.Cipher('bf_cbc', key, iv, M2Crypto.encrypt)
decrypt = EVP.Cipher('bf_cbc', key, iv, M2Crypto.decrypt)

binary = struct.pack("&gt;Q", 42)
ciphertext = encrypt.update(binary)

decrypt.update(ciphertext) # output is delayed by one block
i = struct.unpack("&gt;Q", decrypt.update(dummy_block))

print i
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>SWIG is pretty much the canonical method.  Works good, too.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I've had good success with Cython, as well.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I would recommend <a href="http://chandlerproject.org/Projects/MeTooCrypto" rel="nofollow">M2Crypto</a> as well, but if the code sample by joeforker looks a bit strange you might have an easier time understanding the M2Crypto cipher unit tests, which include Blowfish. Check out the CipherTestCase in <a href="http://svn.osafoundation.org/m2crypto/trunk/tests/test_evp.py" rel="nofollow">test_evp.py</a>.</p>
