<h3>Question (ID-5336320):</h3><h2>Python: how to know function return type and argument types?</h2><p>While I am aware of the duck-typing concept of Python, I sometimes struggle with the type of arguments of functions, or the type of the return value of the function.</p>

<p>Now, if I wrote the function myself, I DO know the types. But what if somebody wants to use and call my functions, how is he/she expected to know the types? 
I usually put type information in the function's docstring (like: <code>"...the id argument should be an integer..."</code> and <code>"... the function will return a (string, [integer]) tuple."</code>)</p>

<p>But is looking up the information in the docstring (and putting it there, as a coder) really the way it is supposed to be done? </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> While the majority of answers seem to direct towards "yes, document!" I feel this is not always very easy for 'complex' types.<br> For example: how to describe <em>concisely</em> in a docstring that a function returns a list of tuples, with each tuple of the form (node_id, node_name, uptime_minutes) and that the elements are respectively a string, string and integer?<br>
The docstring PEP documentation doesn't give any guidelines on that.<br>
I guess the counterargument will be that in that case classes should be used, but I find python very flexible because it allows passing around these things using lists and tuples, i.e. <em>without</em> classes.</p>

<p>Some editors allow you to see docstrings while typing, so it really makes work easier.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>This is how dynamic languages work. It is not always a good thing though, especially if the documentation is poor - anyone tried to use a poorly documented python framework? Sometimes you have to revert to reading the source.</p>

<p>Here are some strategies to avoid problems with duck typing:</p>

<ul>
<li>create a language for your problem domain</li>
<li>this will help you to name stuff properly</li>
<li>use types to represent concepts in your domain language</li>
<li>name function parameters using the domain language vocabulary</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, one of the most important points:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>keep data as local as possible!</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>There should only be a few well-defined and documented types being passed around. Anything else should be obvious by looking at the code: Don't have weird parameter types coming from far away that you can't figure out by looking in the vicinity of the code...</p>

<p>Related, (and also related to docstrings), there is a technique in python called <code>doctests</code>. Use that to document how your methods are expected to be used - and have nice unit test coverage at the same time!</p>

<p>Um... There is no "concise" description of this.  It's complex.  You've designed it to be complex.  And it requires complex documentation in the docstring.</p>

<p>Sorry, but complexity is -- well -- complex.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Yes, since it's a dynamically type language ;)</p>

<p>Read this for reference: <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/" rel="nofollow">PEP 257</a></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Yes it is.  </p>

<p>In Python a function doesn't always have to return a variable of the same type (although your code will be more readable if your functions do always return the same type).  That means that you can't specify a single return type for the function.</p>

<p>In the same way, the parameters don't always have to be the same type too.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Docstrings (and documentation in general). Python 3 introduces (optional) function annotations, as described in <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3107/" rel="nofollow">PEP 3107</a> (but don't leave out docstrings) </p>
