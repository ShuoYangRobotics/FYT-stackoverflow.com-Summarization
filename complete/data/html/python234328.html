<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Surprised no one has said this yet, but <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/" rel="nofollow">Django</a> would be a python package that is very nicely coded and designed.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Look in the Python Standard Library.  It is a great wealth of python code.  I particularly like this.py :)</p>

<p>Seriously though there is good code in the std library.</p>
