<h3>Question (ID-8369029):</h3><h2>Will the function in python for loop be executed multiple times?</h2><p>Say I have the following class with a method returning a list:</p>

<pre><code>Class C():
  def f():
    return [1,2,3]
</code></pre>

<p>If I loop over the this method as follows:</p>

<pre><code>c=C()
for i in c.f():
  print i
</code></pre>

<p>Inside the for loop, will c.f() be executed multiple times? If yes, in order to get it once, do I have to do assignment outside of the loop, or there is some trivial way?</p>

<p>Seems the answer is no.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><code>c.f()</code> will not get executed multiple times.</p>

<p>You didn't ask, but you might be curious about <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/classes.html#generators" rel="nofollow">generators</a>.</p>

<p>Your example as a generator would be as follows:</p>

<pre><code>Class C():
  def f():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3
</code></pre>

<p>The loop where you iterate over the results would be unchanged.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>from the <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/compound_stmts.html#for" rel="nofollow">python docs</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The for statement is used to iterate over the elements of a sequence
  (such as a string, tuple or list) or other iterable object:</p>

<pre><code>for_stmt ::=  "for" target_list "in" expression_list ":" suite
             ["else" ":" suite] 
</code></pre>
  
  <p><strong>The expression list is evaluated once</strong>; it should yield an iterable object.</p>
</blockquote>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>No it is <strong>executed once</strong>.</p>

<p>And your method is not correctly defined. Should have a <code>self</code> argument:</p>

<pre><code>class C:
  def f(self):
    return [1,2,3]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>It will be executed only once. But there will be syntax errors in your code:</p>

<p><code>class</code> , not Class<br>
<code>def f(self)</code>, not def f()</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Did you try to test it yourself? The answer to your question is NO.</p>

<p>Here is how you should have tested it. Moreover there were lot of flaws in your code. Check the self commented modified version below</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class C: #its class not Class and C not C()
    def f(self): #You were missing the self argument
        print "in f" #Simple Test to validate your query
        return [1,2,3]


&gt;&gt;&gt; c=C()
&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in c.f():
    print i


in f
1
2
3
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>Though this example is trivial but still I will use this as an example to explain how we can leverage the power of <a href="http://docs.python.org/howto/functional.html" rel="nofollow">functional programming</a> of Python. What I will try to explain is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation" rel="nofollow">lazy evaluation</a> or generator functions(http://docs.python.org/glossary.html#term-generator). </p>

<p>Consider the modified example</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class C: #its class not Class and C not C()
    def f(self): #You were missing the self argument
        print "in f" #Simple Test to validate your query
        for i in [1,2,3]:
            yield i #Generates the next value when ever it is requsted
        return #Exits the Generator


&gt;&gt;&gt; c=C()
&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in c.f():
    print i


in f
1
2
3
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>Can you spot the difference?</p>
