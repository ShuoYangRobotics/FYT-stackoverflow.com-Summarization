<h3>Question (ID-4187185):</h3><h2>How can I check if my python object is a number?</h2><p>Pretty simple question, I think.  In Java the numeric types all descend from Number so I would use</p>

<pre><code>(x instanceof Number).
</code></pre>

<p>There must be python equivalent but I'm having trouble finding it.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>In mor recent Python version (2.6+; in older versions you're pretty much limited to checking for a few hardcoded types), the correct way is</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import numbers
&gt;&gt;&gt; import decimal
&gt;&gt;&gt; [isinstance(x, numbers.Number) for x in (0, 0.0, 0j, decimal.Decimal(0))]
[True, True, True, True]
</code></pre>

<p>This uses <a href="http://docs.python.org/glossary.html#term-abstract-base-class" rel="nofollow">ABCs</a> and will work for all build-in number-like classes, and also for all third-party classes if they are worth their salt (registered as subclasses of the <code>Number</code> ABC). However, in many cases you shouldn't worry about checking typed manually - Python is duck-typed and mixing somewhat compatible types usually works, yet it will barf an error message when some operation doesn't make sense (<code>4 - "1"</code>), so manually checking this is rarely really needed. It's just bonus, you can add it when finishing this module to avoid pestering others with implementation details.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>That's not really how python works. Just use it like you would a number, and if someone passes you something that's not a number, fail. It's the programmer's responsibility to pass in the correct types.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I think this would work:</p>

<p>isinstance(x, (int, long, float, complex))</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Sure you can use <code>isinstance</code>, but be aware that this is not how Python works. Python is a duck typed language. You should not explicitly check your types. A <code>TypeError</code> will be raised if the incorrect type was passed. </p>

<p>So just assume it is an <code>int</code>. Don't bother checking.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Use python's isinstance function:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a =2
&gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance(a,int)
True
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>isinstance(1, int) # works for ints.</p>

<p>not sure about all different types of numbers in one single test.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Use <code>Number</code> from the <code>numbers</code> module to test <code>isinstance(n, Number)</code> (available since 2.6).</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from numbers import Number
... from decimal import Decimal
... from fractions import Fraction
... for n in [2, 2.0, Decimal('2.0'), complex(2,0), Fraction(2,1), '2']:
...     print '%15s %s' % (n.__repr__(), isinstance(n, Number))
              2 True
            2.0 True
 Decimal('2.0') True
         (2+0j) True
 Fraction(2, 1) True
            '2' False
</code></pre>

<p>This is, of course, contrary to duck typing. If you are more concerned about how an object acts rather than what it is, perform your operations as if you have a number and use exceptions to tell you otherwise.</p>
