<h3>Question (ID-3047012):</h3><h2>how to perform square root without using math module?</h2><p>i want to find the square root of a number without using the math module,as i need to call the function some 20k times and dont want to slow down the execution by linking to the math module each time the function is called </p>

<p>is there any faster and easier way for finding square root??</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Importing the math module only happens once, and you probably won't get much faster than the math module. There is also an older Stackoverflow question regarding <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/327002/which-is-faster-in-python-x-5-or-math-sqrtx">Which is faster in Python: x**.5 or math.sqrt(x)?</a>. It is not clear which method is faster.</p>

<p>Maybe take a look at <a href="http://numpy.scipy.org/" rel="nofollow">NumPy</a> and <a href="http://www.scipy.org/" rel="nofollow">SciPy</a>, not necessarily for the sqrt but if you're doing some heavy calculations they could be handy.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>As Fabian said, it's hard to be faster than <code>math.sqrt</code>.  The reason is that it calls the correspond function from the C library, with CPython.</p>

<p>However, you can speed things up by removing the overhead of attribute lookup:</p>

<pre><code>from math import sqrt
</code></pre>

<p>Each subsequent call to sqrt will <em>not</em> have to look it up in the math module, which saves execution time:</p>

<pre><code>print sqrt(2)
</code></pre>

<p>Here are timing numbers, from the fastest to the slowest (Python 2.6.5, Mac OS X 10.6.3): <code>sqrt</code> is faster than <code>**0.5</code>:</p>

<pre><code>lebigot@weinberg ~ % python -m timeit -s 'from math import sqrt; x = 2' 'sqrt(x)'
1000000 loops, best of 3: 0.207 usec per loop
lebigot@weinberg ~ % python -m timeit -s 'x = 2' 'x**0.5'
1000000 loops, best of 3: 0.226 usec per loop
lebigot@weinberg ~ % python -m timeit -s 'import math; x = 2' 'math.sqrt(x)'
1000000 loops, best of 3: 0.268 usec per loop
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the timing tests calculate the square root of a <em>variable</em>.  They do not calculate a constant like "2*<em>0.5", because "2</em>*0.5" is <em>pre</em>-calculated, in CPython:</p>

<pre><code>import dis

def f():
    return 2**0.5

print dis.dis(f)
</code></pre>

<p>prints</p>

<pre><code>2           0 LOAD_CONST               3 (1.4142135623730951)
            3 RETURN_VALUE        
</code></pre>

<p>where you see the constant float sqrt(2) = 1.414â€¦</p>

<p>If you manipulate arrays of numbers, NumPy's <code>sqrt</code> is the way to go, as mentioned in another answer.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You could implement Newton's method but, though it's really fast, it's unlikely to be faster than the C version which I assume is implemented in the math module. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots</a> .</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>In some special cases you can trade program size for blistering speed. Create a large array and store the pre-calculated result for every square root operation (using the input value as the index). It's pretty limited but you won't get anything faster.</p>

<p>(That's how quake did it)</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Use the power operator, and raise your numbers to the 1/2 power: </p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 2**0.5
1.4142135623730951
</code></pre>

<p>As to whether it's faster: </p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; timeit.timeit(stmt='sqrt(x)', setup='from math import sqrt; x = 2')
0.7182440785071833
&gt;&gt;&gt; timeit.timeit(stmt='x**0.5', setup='from math import sqrt; x = 2')
0.87514279049432275
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I'd think the math library would likely be as fast as anything you could write yourself. But if you want to write your own, here's one algorithm. I don't know Python, so I'll just write some pseudo-code.</p>

<pre><code>function sqrt(x)
  lastGuess=x/2
  loop
    guess=(lastGuess+x/lastGuess)/2
    if abs(guess-lastGuess)&lt;.000001 // or whatever threshold you want
      exit loop
    lastGuess=guess
  return guess
</code></pre>

<p>and the pseudocode translated to Python:</p>

<pre><code>def sqrt(x):
    last_guess= x/2.0
    while True:
        guess= (last_guess + x/last_guess)/2
        if abs(guess - last_guess) &lt; .000001: # example threshold
            return guess
        last_guess= guess
</code></pre>
