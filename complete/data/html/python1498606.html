<h3>Question (ID-1498606):</h3><h2>book recommendations for perl type programming in python or ruby</h2><p>My programming experience: I know Java, understand OOP and know some recursion.</p>

<p>I would like to learn how to write "scripts" for text processing, file handling and stuff like that. I'm fine with learning either Ruby or Python for this. I want a book that focuses on what I've mentioned above but most books just teach more than that (OOP, Data Structures...) and I don't have enough time for those.</p>

<p>So far, the book that I think is the most suitable is actually Learning Perl (the Llama book) as it is only 300+ pages long and teach what I want to learn. However, I don't wanna learn Perl.</p>

<p>So, in short, is there any Python or Ruby book that teaches what Learning Perl teaches?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-11):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Why don't you want to learn Perl?  It's a great language and a fine introduction to the world of scripting.  And as you've found it has some of the best introductory texts out there.</p>

<p>I happen to be a long-time Perl programmer now working mostly in Python and I can't say I've seen anything to equal Learning Perl.  I got my feet wet with Dive Into Python, and it's a good book but hardly suitable for a beginner.</p>

<p>Since you mentioned Ruby though, I have to say that Why's (Poignant) Guide to Ruby is hilarious and absolutely worth a read:</p>

<p>It's a shame he had to go.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The Llama book is a bit more "tutorial-like" that the following recommendation, but in you choose Python, you'll find the <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596001674/" rel="nofollow"><strong>Python Cookbook</strong></a> O'Reilly pub. (Martelli, Ravenscroft and Asher) quite insightful.</p>

<p>Like the Llama, its chapters are structured around functional areas (file I/O, Searching and Sorting, Databases/Persitence, Debugging, User Interface, XML...).  As with "cookbooks" the chapters are collections of task-oriented recipes, but beyond the working snippets, you get a good explanation of what and how things are done, along with references, some online, if you wish to dig further.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, a great book for both beginners and advanced Python programmers, without the "programming 101" type of presentation you wish to avoid.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>For your specific needs I would suggest these 2 books:</p>

<p><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0596529864" rel="nofollow">Learning Ruby</a></p>

<p><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0977616614" rel="nofollow">Everyday Scripting in Ruby</a></p>

<p>Please note that the Learning Ruby book is EXTREMELY ELEMENTARY possibly more so than Learning Perl.  If you want a more robust treatment of ruby at the beginners level than I would recommend this one:</p>

<p><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1934356085" rel="nofollow">Pickaxe Programming Ruby</a></p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>O'Reilly books are pretty good.</p>

<p><a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596516178/" rel="nofollow">The Ruby Programming Language</a></p>

<p><a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596158064/" rel="nofollow">Learning Python</a></p>

<p>Then there is the pickaxe book for Ruby.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/ruby3/programming-ruby-1-9" rel="nofollow">Programming Ruby 1.9: The Pragmatic Programmers' Guide</a></p>

<p>However, if your just wanting to do some basic stuff, like the text processing and file handling that you mention, then using Google is a good choice.  There is a lot of information on the web for free about these topics that you can find through some simple searches.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I'm rubyist, so my advice is about Ruby only.</p>

<p>1) At first, you should give a look to <a href="http://tryruby.sophrinix.com/" rel="nofollow">try Ruby in your browser</a></p>

<p>2) There is single book for studying Ruby - Programming Ruby.
The Pragmatic Programmer's Guide (it's on Amazon for purchase as well as on the official site for reading) It could be used as reference, not as coursebook - you know all the basics from the first point.</p>

<p>3)Don't forget to use irb - it is interactive Ruby shell. Excellent for testing some code, and experiments</p>

<p>Merry coding!</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p><a href="http://gnosis.cx/TPiP/" rel="nofollow">Text Processing in Python by David Mertz</a></p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Don't overlook <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1590598210" rel="nofollow">Practical Ruby for System Administration</a> by 
Andr√© Ben Hamou which is a great book with a terrible name. Andre comes from a Perl background (amongst a lot else). He goes through all kinds of practical examples such as:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>one-liners like:</p>

<pre><code>$ ruby -ne 'puts $_ if $_ =~ /andre/' /etc/passwd /etc/group
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>extending the built-in <code>File</code> class to provide <code>open_locked</code> and <code>open_safely</code> methods</p></li>
<li><p>using metaprogramming techniques to make a DSL allowing a server to be configured with:</p>

<pre><code>server "bitbucket.example.com" do |srv| 
  srv.shares "/homes", :over =&gt; ["afp", "smb"], :as =&gt; "HOMES" 
end 
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>It's a funny and wide-reaching book which covers a lot of ground and includes some tricks (and opinions) I've not seen anywhere else.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>the ruby book recommendations above are good, there are a bunch more on Amazon.  The OO models for ruby, python and Java are different, it's worth looking at that stuff.  The perl OO model stands apart (I think that's a nice euphemism!)</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>python: I like the Pilgrim and Hetlund books</p>

<p><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1590599829" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Python-Novice-Professional-Second/dp/1590599829/</a></p>

<p><a href="http://diveintopython.org/toc/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://diveintopython.org/toc/index.html</a></p>

<p>Again, a bunch more on Amazon.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>Actually I've been thinking about this a little more and I think this book is an excellent resource for a beginner looking to learn ruby.  Not only does it go through the basics but it teaches oop at a beginner level quite effectively.  It is also a pleasure to read and actually keeps the readers asttention and interest (which the majority of technical books fail so thoroughly to do!).  All in all this book is a gem (pun intended!!), well worth the 40 bucks you can get it for at amazon:</p>

<p><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0321490452" rel="nofollow">Design Patterns in Ruby</a></p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>No book, but the PLEAC project aims to implement the <a href="http://pleac.sourceforge.net" rel="nofollow">solutions from the Perl Cookbook in many other languages</a>, also ruby and python. Not all topics are fully covered, but topics like Strings are.</p>
<br /><b>#10</b><br /><p>Books with examples in Ruby, Python, Perl , etc...</p>
