<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>nixnotwin, I understand you are good with Web Programming in the first place. If not, start with <a href="http://webpython.codepoint.net/" rel="nofollow">http://webpython.codepoint.net/</a> to understand the Basic Concepts and then head over to the Django tutorial.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Some books/tutorials that are not already mentioned:</p>

<p><a href="http://lightbird.net/dbe/" rel="nofollow">Django by example</a></p>

<p>A book with some standard applications - <a href="http://agiliq.com/books/djenofdjango/" rel="nofollow">Djen of Django</a></p>

<p>Tutorial for beginners - <a href="http://www.webmonkey.com/2010/02/get_started_with_django/" rel="nofollow">Get started with Django</a></p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I suggest you go over to <a href="http://www.showmedo.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.showmedo.com</a> as they have screencasts of various programming languages, frameworks, some really good Django tutorials for beginners and even one about Django debugging by Eric Holscher. </p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Once you get acquainted with the url system and the Model/View/Template paradigm, you can start playing with the Admin interface and learn from it.
Then you can try to build your own test application.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>There is <a href="http://www.aprendendodjango.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.aprendendodjango.com/</a> (link in portuguese) , which is a site that teachs django aiming non-programmers.</p>
