<h3>Question (ID-7975515):</h3><h2>Is it a sin to use infinite recursion for infinite loops in Python?</h2><p>This question is more about curiosity than utility. If I'm writing a function that's supposed to run for ever, for instance a daemon, how would Python handle it if I called the function again from the end of the function?</p>

<pre><code>def daemonLoop():

    # Declare locals

    # Do stuff

    daemonLoop()
</code></pre>

<p>I'm fairly sure that doing this in <strong>C</strong> would result in a stack overflow, but given the level of abstraction from <strong>C</strong> to Python I'm guessing stuff is handled differently.</p>

<p>Would I go to hell for this?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>In almost all Python interpreters that will cause a stack overflow, as it would in C. The higher-level feature that would permit this is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call" rel="nofollow">Tail Call Optimization</a> or Tail Recursion Elimination, and <a href="http://neopythonic.blogspot.com/2009/04/tail-recursion-elimination.html" rel="nofollow">the benevolent dictator of Python opposes adding this to the language</a>.</p>

<p>This style is considered to be non-idiomatic for Python, and a simple <code>while True:</code> loop is preferred.</p>

<p>Yes. CPython has no Tail Recursion Elimination / Last Call Optimization.</p>

<pre><code>def recurse():
    recurse()

recurse()
</code></pre>

<p>Error:</p>

<pre>
  # 1000 or so lines of this:
  File "", line 2, in recurse
RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded
</pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>The C version of the Python interpreter (which is probably what you're using) will raise an error eventually if you never return from <code>daemonLoop</code>.  I'm not sure about other versions.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I don't know why you'd think about doing something like that when you could simply have an infinite <code>while</code> loop. Anyway for your question about whether it will work:</p>

<pre><code>...
  File "test.py", line 7, in daemonLoop
    daemonLoop()
  File "test.py", line 7, in daemonLoop
    daemonLoop()
RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded
</code></pre>

<p>So yeah, hell it is.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Probably not a good idea....</p>

<pre><code>def forever(): forever()

forever()
</code></pre>

<p>RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded</p>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><pre><code>(define forever (lambda () (forever)))
</code></pre>

<p>This kind of recursion is what Lisp dialects like Scheme are made for!</p>
