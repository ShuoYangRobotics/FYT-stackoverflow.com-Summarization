<h3>Question (ID-1097711):</h3><h2>How to get repository for core-plot</h2><p>I am not able to get the repository for core-plot. What I am doing is that I am typing this in the terminal:</p>

<pre><code>hg clone https://core-plot.googlecode.com/hg/ core-plot
</code></pre>

<p>and this is what I get:</p>

<pre>

<p>I can't seem to get it to install. Please give me guidance on how to install the repository.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>It looks like you're having a problem with your locale. Are you using Leopard? If so, check your Terminal preferences. In the Terminal prefs, open up the Settings pane, and click the Advanced tab. The "Character Encoding" menu should be set to "Unicode (UTF-8)". Also make sure that "Set LANG variable on startup" is checked.</p>

<p>You can check your locale setting by opening up the Terminal and typing <code>echo $LANG</code>. Mine returns <code>en_US.UTF-8</code> (US English, UTF-8). Not sure what your preferred language is, but it should be <code>&lt;langcode&gt;.UTF-8</code> -- make sure it ends with <code>UTF-8</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>See following question here,</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1694539/how-to-create-line-chart-in-iphone-application/1717734#1717734">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1694539/how-to-create-line-chart-in-iphone-application/1717734#1717734</a></p>

<p>I have added my answer there for the same one.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The repository works perfectly fine:</p>

<pre><code>â†ª hg clone https://core-plot.googlecode.com/hg/ core-plot
requesting all changes
adding changesets
adding manifests
adding file changes
added 406 changesets with 3444 changes to 1861 files
updating working directory
1018 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved
</code></pre>

<p>So I suspect your problem is that <code>hg</code> isn't in your path, or you've not installed Mercurial. You should <a href="http://mercurial.berkwood.com/" rel="nofollow">grab a copy of the installer</a>, or install via your package management system (MacPorts, Apt, YUM etc.)</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>It looks to me like you have a broken Python installation. However, since you're trying to get Mercurial working, please contact the Mercurial team through the correct channels. Use the</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/MailingLists" rel="nofollow">Mercurial mailinglist</a></strong> or the</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/bts/" rel="nofollow">Mercurial bug tracker</a></strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Doing so means that many more people see your problem and hopefully there will be someone who is using Mac who can help you (I'm using Debian and don't know what Apple has done to your Python installation...).</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>LANG can be overridden by HGENCODING. If "echo $HGENCODING" produces "UTF-8" that's your culprit. Unset it or set it to en_US.UTF-8 (or whatever language you prefer, but it should end in .UTF-8). You could also try setting HGENCODING or LANG to "C" if you have no need for non-ascii characters, or just as a test.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I am creating local copy of core plot repository using following command but it gives error,</p>

<p>hg clone <a href="https://core-plot.googlecode.com/hg/" rel="nofollow">https://core-plot.googlecode.com/hg/</a> core-plot</p>

<p>abort: error: Connection refused</p>

<p>Please suggest me solution.</p>
