<h3>Question (ID-1356348):</h3><h2>sum of two numbers coming from the command line</h2><p>I know it's a very basic program but I am getting an error of list out of range. Here is the program to take two numbers as command-line arguments (while invoking the script) and display sum (using python):</p>

<pre><code>import sys
a= sys.argv[1]
b= sys.argv[2]
sum=str( a+b)
print " sum is", sum
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You should do this:</p>

<pre><code>import sys
a, b = sys.argv[1:2]
summ = int(a) + int(b)
print "sum is", summ
</code></pre>

<p>There is no need for str() when printing an integer. But you should use int() if you want to add a and b as integers.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The error <code>list index out of range</code> means that you are trying to access a list item that is outside the bounds of the list.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; mylist = ['hello', 'world']
&gt;&gt;&gt; print mylist[2]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
IndexError: list index out of range
</code></pre>

<p>In your case, the error comes from either <code>sys.argv[1]</code> or <code>sys.argv[2]</code>.</p>

<p>Make sure you actually pass something to the program from the command line.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Assuming your inputs are integers:</p>

<pre><code>import sys
summ = sum(map(int,sys.argv[1:])
print "sum is ", summ
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>import sys
summ = sum(int(i) for i in sys.argv[1:])
print "sum is ", summ
</code></pre>

<p>If not, change int to float.</p>

<p>The second method is probably more pythonic, but the first is a little faster in this instance.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;import timeit
&gt;&gt;&gt;t1 = timeit.Timer("sum(map(int,['3','5','7','9']))")
&gt;&gt;&gt;t2 = timeit.Timer("sum(int(i) for i in ['3','5','7','9'])")
&gt;&gt;&gt;print t1.timeit()
3.0187220573425293
&gt;&gt;&gt;print t2.timeit()
3.4699549674987793
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><pre><code>su = int(a) + int(b)
print("sum is %d" % su)
</code></pre>

<p>And you should be careful with your variable naming. <code>sum</code> shadows the built-in, it's not a good practice to do that (that is, don't name variables as built-in functions or any globally defined name).</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>If your error is <em>"list index out of range"</em>, then the problem is that your <em>list</em> doesn't have enough items.  Which list? The only list you're using is <strong><code>sys.argv</code></strong>, so to populate it, you need to pass more items on the command line.</p>

<p>Alternatively, check for the length of the argument list with <code>len(sys.argv)</code> and prompt interactively (e.g. using <code>raw_input()</code>) to get the values if they're not in <code>sys.argv</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>If you wish to sum the numbers as floating points number use "float" instead of "int", like in the following snippet.</p>

<pre><code>import sys
try:
   a, b = sys.argv[1:3]
   print "sum is ", float(a) + float(b)
except ValueError:
   print "please give me two numbers to sum"
</code></pre>

<p>Beware that floating points are different from real numbers, so that you could obtain seemingly "strange" results about which there is a wealth of documentation on the web.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Thanks to every one. I got the answer</p>

<p>for i in range (1,51):
    if i%5==0:
    	print i,"\n"
    else:
    	print  i,</p>
