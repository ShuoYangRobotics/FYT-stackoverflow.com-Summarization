<h3>Question (ID-603641):</h3><h2>Using for...else in Python generators</h2><p>I'm a big fan of Python's <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-for-statement" rel="nofollow">for...else syntax</a> - it's surprising how often it's applicable, and how effectively it can simplify code.</p>

<p>However, I've not figured out a nice way to use it in a generator, for example:</p>

<pre><code>def iterate(i):
    for value in i:
        yield value
    else:
        print 'i is empty'
</code></pre>

<p>In the above example, I'd like the <code>print</code> statement to be executed only if <code>i</code> is empty. However, as <code>else</code> only respects <code>break</code> and <code>return</code>, it is always executed, regardless of the length of <code>i</code>.</p>

<p>If it's impossible to use <code>for...else</code> in this way, what's the best approach to this so that the <code>print</code> statement is only executed when nothing is yielded?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You're breaking the definition of a generator, which should throw a StopIteration exception when iteration is complete (which is automatically handled by a return statement in a generator function)</p>

<p>So:</p>

<pre><code>def iterate(i):
    for value in i:
        yield value
    return
</code></pre>

<p>Best to let the calling code handle the case of an empty iterator:</p>

<pre><code>count = 0
for value in iterate(range([])):
    print value
    count += 1
else:
    if count == 0:
        print "list was empty"
</code></pre>

<p>Might be a cleaner way of doing the above, but that ought to work fine, and doesn't fall into any of the common 'treating an iterator like a list' traps below.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>There are a couple ways of doing this.  You could always use the <code>Iterator</code> directly:</p>

<pre><code>def iterate(i):
    try:
        i_iter = iter(i)
        next = i_iter.next()
    except StopIteration:
        print 'i is empty'
        return

    while True:
        yield next
        next = i_iter.next()
</code></pre>

<p>But if you know more about what to expect from the argument <code>i</code>, you can be more concise:</p>

<pre><code>def iterate(i):
    if i:  # or if len(i) == 0
        for next in i:
            yield next
    else:
        print 'i is empty'
        raise StopIteration()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Summing up some of the earlier answers, it could be solved like this:</p>

<pre><code>def iterate(i):
    empty = True
    for value in i:
        yield value
        empty = False

    if empty:
        print "empty"
</code></pre>

<p>so there really is no "else" clause involved.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>As you note, <code>for..else</code> only detects a <code>break</code>.  So it's only applicable when you look for something and then <strong>stop</strong>.</p>

<p>It's not applicable to your purpose not because it's a generator, but <strong>because you want to process all elements, without stopping</strong> (because you want to yield them all, but that's not the point).</p>

<p>So generator or not, you really need a boolean, as in Ber's solution.</p>

<p>Maximum i can think of:</p>

<pre>
<code>
>>> empty = True
>>> for i in [1,2]:
...     empty = False
... if empty:
...     print 'empty'
...
>>>
>>>
>>> empty = True
>>> for i in []:
...     empty = False
... if empty:
...    print 'empty'
...
empty
>>>
</code>
</pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>What about simple if-else?</p>

<pre><code>def iterate(i):
    if len(i) == 0: print 'i is empty'
    else:
        for value in i:
            yield value
</code></pre>
