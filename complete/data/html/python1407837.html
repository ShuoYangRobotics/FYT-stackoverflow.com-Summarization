<h3>Question (ID-1407837):</h3><h2>Is there an Rake equivalent in Python?</h2><p>Rake is a software build tool written in Ruby (like ant or make), and so all its files are written in this language. Does something like this exist in Python?</p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/waf/" rel="nofollow">Waf</a> is a Python-based framework for configuring, compiling and installing applications. It derives from the concepts of other build tools such as Scons, Autotools, CMake or Ant.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I would check out <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/distutils.html" rel="nofollow"><code>distutils</code></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <code>distutils</code> package provides support
  for building and installing additional
  modules into a Python installation.
  The new modules may be either
  100%-pure Python, or may be extension
  modules written in C, or may be
  collections of Python packages which
  include modules coded in both Python
  and C.</p>

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Also check out buildout, which isn't so much a make system for software, as a make system for a deployment. </p>

<p>So it's not a direct rake equivalent, but may be a better match for what you want to do, or a really lousy one.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>There is <a href="https://github.com/JeremySkinner/Phantom" rel="nofollow">Phantom</a> in Boo (which isn't python but nearly).</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Although it is more commonly used for deployment, <a href="http://readthedocs.org/docs/fabric/en/latest/" rel="nofollow">Fabric</a> might be interesting for this use case.</p>
