<h3>Question (ID-6877301):</h3><h2>Suggest a standalone python web framework?</h2><p>I have a python program that I would like to present as a simple web application.  The program currently uses sqlite for storage.  I also need to distribute the whole thing to colleagues so having something standalone and easy to start would be ideal ( no install if possible).  This web app is meant to be used locally , not by multiple users over a network.</p>

<p>Is there a suitable python framework that might fit my needs?  I looked at Django so far but it seems a bit heavy handed for what I need.</p>

<p>Thanks for any suggestions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bottle is a fast, simple and lightweight WSGI micro web-framework for
  Python. It is distributed as a single file module and has no
  dependencies other than the Python Standard Library.</p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>As web frameworks are not part of the standard lib, you will have to install something in every case. I would propse to look at <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/" rel="nofollow">http://flask.pocoo.org/</a>. It has a build in WSGI server. </p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Lots of choices for Python web frameworks!  Another is <a href="http://web2py.com/" rel="nofollow">web2py</a> which is designed to work out of the box and allows, but doesn't require, through-the-web development.  It is mature and has a strong community and is <a href="http://web2py.com/book" rel="nofollow">well-documented</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Tornado as a framework may be a lot more than what you're looking for. However it will meet the requirement of being a completely python based web server. <a href="http://tornadoweb.org" rel="nofollow">http://tornadoweb.org</a></p>

<p>I generally just download the source, drop it in /tornado/ of my project and do includes there from the app.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I don't think that any web framework is specifically oriented for the use case you're talking about;  They all assume they are running on a server and there's a browser on a remote machine that is accessing them.</p>

<p>A better approach is to think about the HTTP server you'll be using.  It's probably preferable to use a server that's as easy to pack and ship as the rest of the python code you'll be using.  Now most frameworks provide a 'development' server that's easy to invoke from the command line, but most of them are intended to be "easy for the developer" which often means they are restricted to a single thread.  This is bad for deployment because single threaded servers will always feel a bit sluggish.</p>

<p>CherryPy stands out in contrast, by providing a full featured, embedded server that's easy to configure for many use cases, and is available by default with the rest of the framework.  There are probably others, but I haven't used 'em.</p>
