<h3>Question (ID-1419039):</h3><h2>What variable name do you use for file descriptors?</h2><p>A pretty silly trivial question.  The canonical example is <code>f = open('filename')</code>, but</p>

<ul>
<li><code>f</code> is not very descriptive.  After not looking at code in a while,
you can forget whether it means
"file" or "function f(x)" or "fourier
transform results" or something else.  EIBTI.</li>
<li>In Python, <code>file</code> is already taken by a function.</li>
</ul>

<p>What else do you use?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><pre><code> dataFile
 settingsFile
 resultsFile
 .... etc
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You can append it to the beginning, Hungarian-like "file_fft".</p>

<p>However, I would try to close file descriptors as soon as possible, and I recommend using the with statement like this so you don't have to worry about closing it, and it makes it easier to not lose track of it.</p>

<pre><code>with open("x.txt") as f:
    data = f.read()
    do something with data
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>generally I'll use "fp" for a short-lifetime file pointer.</p>

<p>for a longer-lived descriptor, I'll be more descriptive.  "fpDebugLog", for example.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I'm happy to use <code>f</code> (for either a function OR a file;-) if that identifier's scope is constrained to a pretty small compass (such as <code>with open('zap') as f:</code> would normally portend, say). In general, identifiers with large lexical scopes should be longer and more explicit, ones with lexically small/short scopes/lifespans can be shorter and less explicit, and this applies to open file object just about as much as to any other kind of object!-)</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I rather use one of: <code>f, fp, fd</code>.</p>

<p>Sometimes <code>inf</code> / <code>outf</code> for input and output file.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Generally if the scope of a file object is only a few lines, <code>f</code> is perfectly readable - the variable name for the filename in the open call is probably descriptive enough. otherwise <code>something_file</code> is probably a good idea.</p>
