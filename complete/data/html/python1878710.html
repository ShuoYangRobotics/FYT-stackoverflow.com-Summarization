<h3>Question (ID-1878710):</h3><h2>struct objects in python</h2><p>I wanted to create a throwaway "struct" object to keep various status flags. My first approach was this (javascript style)</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; status = object()
&gt;&gt;&gt; status.foo = 3  
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
AttributeError: 'object' object has no attribute 'foo'
</code></pre>

<p>Definitely not what I expected, because this works:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class Anon: pass
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; b=Anon()
&gt;&gt;&gt; b.foo = 4
</code></pre>

<p>I guess this is because object() does not have a <code>__dict__</code>. I don't want to use a dictionary, and assuming I don't want to create the Anon object, is there another solution ?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The most concise way to make "a generic object to which you can assign/fetch attributes" is probably:</p>

<pre><code>b = lambda:0
</code></pre>

<p>As most other answers point out, there are many other ways, but it's hard to beat this one for conciseness (<code>lambda:0</code> is exactly the same number of characters as <code>object()</code>...;-).</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>From the <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/classes.html#odds-and-ends" rel="nofollow">Python Official Documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>9.7. Odds and Ends</p>
  
  <p>Sometimes it is useful to have a data
  type similar to the Pascal “record” or
  C “struct”, bundling together a few
  named data items. An empty class
  definition will do nicely:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>class Employee:
    pass

john = Employee() # Create an empty employee record

# Fill the fields of the record 
john.name = 'John Doe' 
john.dept = 'computer lab' 
john.salary = 1000
</code></pre>

<p>This seems natural and simple: Pythonic. <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/" rel="nofollow">Remember the Zen!</a> "Simple is better than complex" (number 3) and "If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea" (number 11)</p>

<p>In addition, a <code>struct</code> is nothing but a <code>class</code> with public members (i.e., <code>struct{};</code> and <code>class{public:};</code> are the exact same thing (in, say, C++)). Shouldn't you consider this and avoid artificial constructs in your Python program? Python is supposed to be readable, maintainable, and easy to understand.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Try this</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; status=type('status',(object,),{})()
&gt;&gt;&gt; status.foo=3
&gt;&gt;&gt; status.foo
3
</code></pre>

<p>You don't have to give the class a name if you don't want to</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; status=type('',(object,),{})()
&gt;&gt;&gt; status.__class__.__name__
''
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I had the same question once.  I asked it in a mailing list, and Alex Martelli pointed out that <code>object</code> is the basis of all inheritance in Python; if <code>object()</code> created a class instance with its own dictionary, then every object in Python would have to have its own dictionary, and that would waste memory.  For example, <code>True</code> and <code>False</code> are objects; clearly they don't have any need for their own dictionaries!</p>

<p>I would be happy if there was some sort of built-in Python feature where I could just say:</p>

<pre><code>x = struct()
x.foo = 1
x.bar = 2
</code></pre>

<p>But it is trivial to write <code>struct()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>class struct(object):
    pass
</code></pre>

<p>Or you could do a slightly more complex one:</p>

<pre><code>class struct(object):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        self.__dict__.update(kwargs)
</code></pre>

<p>The more complex one lets you do this:</p>

<pre><code>x = struct(foo=1, bar=2)
print(x.foo) # prints 1
print(x.bar) # prints 2
x.baz = 3
print(x.baz) # prints 3
</code></pre>

<p>But it is so trivial to write <code>struct()</code> that I guess it wasn't deemed worth adding to the language.  Maybe we should push to have a standard feature added to <code>collections</code> module or something.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I personally think that the cleanest solution is what you already guessed:</p>

<pre><code>class Scratch(object):
    pass

s = Scratch()
s.whatever = 'you want'
</code></pre>

<p>I know you said that you don't want a <code>__dict__</code>, but that confuses me as I can't see a reason to care about that.  You don't have to reference <code>__dict__</code>, that is an internal Python implementation detail.  Anyway, any instance in Python that allows dynamically adding attributes will have a <code>__dict__</code> because that's how Python does dynamic attributes.  Even if the instance is created in a really clever way, it will have a <code>__dict__</code>.</p>

<p>If you have not already done so, I recommend reading <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/" rel="nofollow">PEP 20</a> and PEP 8 (no reputation, so only one link for me.)  Not that the PEPs directly relate to your question, but I think it's useful in starting to use Python in a <em>Pythonic</em> manner.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>The mystery here is the difference between <strong><em>objects</em></strong> and <strong><em>class instances</em></strong>. </p>

<p>In Python, everything is an object. Classes are objects, integers are objects, types are objects, and class instances are objects. When you say <code>object()</code> you're getting a plain base-level object. It's nothing. Completely useless. Lower level than anything else you can reference in Python.</p>

<p>You probably thought calling <code>object()</code> gives you a class instance. Which is understandable, because you probably thought <code>object</code> is a class. It's not. Even though you might think so since it's the base "class" used for new-style class definitions like:</p>

<pre><code>class MyClass(object):
    pass
</code></pre>

<p><code>object</code> is in fact a <strong><em>type</em></strong> (like how <code>str</code> and <code>int</code> are types). When you call <code>object()</code> you're not constructing a class instance, your instantiating a special type of object. But in <code>object</code>'s case, it's special in how completely <em>blah</em> it is.</p>

<p>Only class instances have the special ability to tack things on with dot notation. That's not a general property of all objects. Imagine if that were the case! You could do crazy stuff like adding properties to strings:</p>

<pre><code>s = "cat"
s.language = "english"
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously you can't do that.</p>
