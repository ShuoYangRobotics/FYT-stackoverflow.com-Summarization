<h3>Question (ID-369391):</h3><h2>Is there an OpenSource BASIC interpreter in Ruby/Python?</h2><p>I want something simple in order to experiment/hack. I've created a lot interpreters/compilers for c and I just want something simple. A basic BASIC :D</p>

<p>If you don't know any (I've done my google search...), yacc/bison is the only way?</p>

<p>Thx</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/" rel="nofollow">PLY</a> is a great parser-creation library for Python. It has a simple BASIC interpreter as one of its example scripts. You could start there.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>None of these listed in <a href="http://www.thefreecountry.com/compilers/basic.shtml" rel="nofollow">TheFreeCountry</a> are acceptable?  None of them are in Python, but I should think that starting from <a href="http://www.xblite.com/" rel="nofollow">XBLite</a>  might be more helpful than starting from Yacc/Bison/<a href="http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/" rel="nofollow">PLY</a>.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="http://vb2py.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">Vb2py</a> might be a better starting position than PLY.</p>

<p>If you must go the PLY route, however, consider the <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~merty/mole/" rel="nofollow">MOLE Basic</a> grammar as a starting point rather than trying to roll your own from scratch.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I also don't know a basic interpreter under ruby, but given enough time and interest ruby easily "supports" writing an interpreter for any language you like: <a href="http://obiefernandez.com/presentations/obie_fernandez-agile_dsl_development_in_ruby.pdf" rel="nofollow">Agile DSL Development
in Ruby</a> . I must admit that this approach comes with some investment of time. :(
At the end of the presentation are some links to further readings regarding DSLs. </p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You may wish to also examine <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrot_virtual_machine" rel="nofollow">the Parrot virtual machine</a> which, according to wikipedia today, has some BASIC support.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>a miniBasic in ruby is available <a href="http://rockit.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Rockit seems WAY more fun that racc.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I have a qBasic program running on DOS</p>

<p>Would like to run it in Python+html environment using an interpreter.</p>

<p>Anyone available to handle the job?</p>
