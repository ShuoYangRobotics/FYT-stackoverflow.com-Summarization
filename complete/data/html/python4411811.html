<h3>Question (ID-4411811):</h3><h2>Python: define multiple variables of same type?</h2><p>Probably a duplicate, but I can't find the answer by searching with these terms, at least. </p>

<p>Is there a quicker way to do this in Python?</p>

<pre><code>level1 = {}
level2 = {}
level3 = {}
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried</p>

<pre><code>level1 = level2 = level3 = {}
</code></pre>

<p>But that seems to create copies of the object, which isn't what I want. And</p>

<pre><code>level1, level2, level3 = {}
</code></pre>

<p>throws an error. </p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Your variable naming is a possible sign that your design could be improved. It might be better to use a list instead of three separate variables:</p>

<pre><code>levels = [{}, {}, {}]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><pre><code>level1 = level2 = level3 = {}
</code></pre>

<p>Doesnâ€™t create copies. It lets reference level{1-3} to the <em>same</em> object. You can use a list comprehension instead:</p>

<pre><code>level1, level2, level3 = [{} for dummy in range(3)]
</code></pre>

<p>or more readable:</p>

<pre><code>level1, level2, level3 = {}, {}, {}
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You could do</p>

<pre><code>level1, level2, level3 = {}, {}, {}
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><pre><code>level1, level2, level3, = {}, {}, {}
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I personally never change code to squeeze more stuff on one line. Have three different assignments is the way I would do it, one per line.</p>

<p>However, if there are documented performance improvements by making such a change, that's another thing. I just don't know of any performance improvements with these changes. Only obfuscation.</p>

<p>What do you mean by quicker?  </p>

<p>I think your real question <em>should be</em> "what is the pythonic way to do this?"  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>level1, level2, level3 = {}</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-str-unicode-list-tuple-bytearray-buffer-xrange" rel="nofollow">Python documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tuples are constructed by the comma operator</strong> (not within square brackets), with or without enclosing parentheses, but an empty tuple must have the enclosing parentheses, such as a, b, c or (). A single item tuple must have a trailing comma, such as (d,).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>a, b, c is implicitly (a, b, c). That's why you need to have a 3-tuple on the right side as suggested by other posters (nils, sdolan, gunner). </p>

<p>Shown explicitly they are suggesting this:</p>

<pre><code>(level1, level2, level3) = ({}, {}, {},)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Python is interpreted which allows the definitions of things to be made at runtime.</p>

<pre><code>def prefixed_range(prefix, start, stop=None, step=1):
    " Like xrange() but results are prefixed numeric strings. """
    prefix = str(prefix)
    if stop is None:
        start, stop = 0, start
    for i in xrange(start, stop, step):
        yield prefix + str(i)

def define_vars(names, value=None, namespace=None):
    namespace = globals() if not namespace else namespace
    factory = (lambda: value) if not callable(value) else value
    for name in names:
        namespace[name] = factory()

define_vars(prefixed_range('level', 1, 4), dict)

print 'level1: {}, level2: {}, level3: {}'.format(level1, level2, level3)
# level1: {}, level2: {}, level3: {}
</code></pre>
