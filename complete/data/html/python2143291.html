<h3>Question (ID-2143291):</h3><h2>Python indentation issue?</h2><p>I'm pretty new to python.  This is my first time working with classes in python.  When I try to run this script, I get </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>IndentationError: expected an indented
  block</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is wrong with this?</p>

<pre><code>import random

class Individual:
    alleles = (0,1)
    length = 5
    string = ""

    def __init__(self):
        #some constructor work, here.

    def evaluate(self):
        #some stuff here.

    def mutate(self, gene):
        #mutate the given gene.

    def onePointCrossover(self, partner):
        #at some random point, crossover.

    def twoPointCrossover(self, partner):
        #at two random(?) points, crossover.

class World:
    def __init__(self):
        #stuff.

    def buildPopulation(self):
        #stuff.
        for individual in self.population():
            for i in range(0, individual.length):
                print random.random()


    def display(self):
        #print some output stuff.

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print "hi there"

<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>All of those methods that consist of just a comment.</p>

<p>To fix it, for example, do this</p>

<pre><code>def twoPointCrossover(self, partner):
        #at two random(?) points, crossover.
        pass
</code></pre>

<p>The comments don't count as compilable statements, so you have a bunch of empty blocks. That is why it gives you the indent error.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>If you use something that ends in <code>:</code> expecting an indented block and you don't have anything that you want to put there (other than a comment) then you need to use <code>pass</code>.</p>

<p>E.g.</p>

<pre><code>def doNothing(self):
    pass
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>When you're just outlining your classes and have a bunch of methods which do nothing, you need to insert the <code>pass</code> statement to indicate that nothing is happening. </p>

<p>Like so: </p>

<pre><code>class Individual:
    alleles = (0,1)
    length = 5
    string = ""

    def __init__(self):
        #some constructor work, here.
        pass

    def evaluate(self):
        #some stuff here.
        pass
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>The unexpected indent message is because python is looking for an indented statement to follow the method definition. </p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Change:</p>

<pre><code>class World:
    def __init__(self):
       #stuff.
</code></pre>

<p>To:</p>

<pre><code>class World:
    def __init__(self):
        #stuff
        pass
</code></pre>

<p>and so on for all the methods.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Unless you're abbreviating your code for this post, you'll need <code>pass</code> after all of those functions that don't have any code.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><pre><code>def __init__(self):
    #stuff.
</code></pre>

<p>That looks wrong at first glance. Try changing it to this:</p>

<pre><code>def __init__(self):
    #stuff.
    pass
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Double check the tabs and spaces in all the code, make sure you are not mixing them.  A line with several spaces may the same as a line with a single tab.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Others have covered <code>pass</code>, so I will just add that for beginning python programmers, it can take some getting used to the importance of whitespace.</p>

<p>Until you get used to it you might want to get in the habit of converting tabs to spaces or spaces to tabs when you save a file.  Personally I prefer tabs because it is easier to tell the difference if it is off by one (especially at the beginning/end of a nested block).</p>
