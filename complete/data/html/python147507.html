<h3>Question (ID-147507):</h3><h2>How does one do the equivalent of "import * from module" with Python's __import__ function?</h2><p>Given a string with a module name, how do you import everything in the module as if you had called:</p>

<pre><code>from module import *
</code></pre>

<p>i.e. given string S="module", how does one get the equivalent of the following:</p>

<pre><code>__import__(S, fromlist="*")
</code></pre>

<p>This doesn't seem to perform as expected (as it doesn't import anything).</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Please reconsider. The only thing worse than <code>import *</code> is <em>magic</em> <code>import *</code>.</p>

<p>If you really want to:</p>

<pre><code>m = __import__ (S)
try:
    attrlist = m.__all__
except AttributeError:
    attrlist = dir (m)
for attr in attrlist:
    globals()[attr] = getattr (m, attr)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Here's my solution for dynamic naming of local settings files for Django.  Note the addition below of a check to not include attributes containing '__' from the imported file.  The <code>__name__</code> global was being overwritten with the module name of the local settings file, which caused <code>setup_environ()</code>, used in manage.py, to have problems.</p>

<pre><code>try:
    import socket
    HOSTNAME = socket.gethostname().replace('.','_')
    # See http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#__import__
    m = __import__(name="settings_%s" % HOSTNAME, globals=globals(), locals=locals(), fromlist="*")
    try:
        attrlist = m.__all__
    except AttributeError:
        attrlist = dir(m)        
    for attr in [a for a in attrlist if '__' not in a]:
        globals()[attr] = getattr(m, attr)

except ImportError, e:
    sys.stderr.write('Unable to read settings_%s.py\n' % HOSTNAME)
    sys.exit(1)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>It appears that you can also use <strong>dict.update()</strong> on module's dictionaries in your case:</p>

<pre><code>config = [__import__(name) for name in names_list]

options = {}
for conf in config:
    options.update(conf.__dict__)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I think there's a short "functional" version of it:</p>

<pre><code>options = reduce(dict.update, map(__import__, names_list))
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The underlying problem is that I am developing some Django, but on more than one host (with colleagues), all with different settings. I was hoping to do something like this in the project/settings.py file:</p>

<pre><code>from platform import node

settings_files = { 'BMH.lan': 'settings_bmh.py", ... } 

__import__( settings_files[ node() ] )
</code></pre>

<p>It seemed a simple solution (thus elegant), but I would agree that it has a smell to it and the simplicity goes out the loop when you have to use logic like what John Millikin posted (thanks). Here's essentially the solution I went with:</p>

<pre><code>from platform import node

from settings_global import *

n = node()

if n == 'BMH.lan':
  from settings_bmh import *
# add your own, here...
else:
  raise Exception("No host settings for '%s'. See settings.py." % node())
</code></pre>

<p>Which works fine for our purposes.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I didn't find a good way to do it so I took a simpler but ugly way from <a href="http://www.djangosnippets.org/snippets/600/" rel="nofollow">http://www.djangosnippets.org/snippets/600/</a></p>

<pre><code>try:
    import socket
    hostname = socket.gethostname().replace('.','_')
    exec "from host_settings.%s import *" % hostname
except ImportError, e:
    raise e
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You don't, that's a very silly idea and entirely unpythonic.</p>
