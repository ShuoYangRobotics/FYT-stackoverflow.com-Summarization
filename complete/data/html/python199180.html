<h3>Question (ID-199180):</h3><h2>Is there any way to get python omnicomplete to work with non-system modules in vim?</h2><p>The only thing I can get python omnicomplete to work with are system modules. I get nothing for help with modules in my site-packages or modules that I'm currently working on.</p>

  <p>PySmell is a python IDE completion helper.</p>
  
  <p>It tries to statically analyze Python source code, without executing it, and generates information about a projectâ€™s structure that IDE tools can use. </p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I get completion for my own modules in my PYTHONPATH or site-packages. I'm not sure what version of the pythoncomplete.vim script you're using, but you may want to make sure it's the latest.</p>

<p>EDIT: Here's some examples of what I'm seeing on my system...</p>

<p>This file (mymodule.py), I puth in a directory in PYTHONPATH, and then in site-packages. Both times I was able to get the screenshot below.</p>

<pre><code>myvar = 'test'

def myfunction(foo='test'):
    pass

class MyClass(object):
    pass
</code></pre>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Once I generated ctags for one of my site-packages, it started working for that package -- so I'm guessing that the omnicomplete function depends on ctags for non-sys modules.</p>

<p>EDIT: Not true at all.</p>

<p>Here's the problem -- poor testing on my part -- omnicomplete WAS working for parts of my project, just not most of it.</p>

<p>The issue was that I'm working on a django project, and in order to import django.db, you need to have an environment variable set. Since I couldn't import django.db, any class that inherited from django.db, or any module that imported a class that inherited from django.db wouldn't complete.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>While it's important to note that you must properly set your <code>PYTHONPATH</code> environmental variable, per the the previous answer, there is a notable <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/vim%5Fdev/browse%5Fthread/thread/58191d176ebd9722/d9cd31cee304b7df" rel="nofollow">bug in Vim which prevents omnicompletion from working when an import fails</a>. As of Vim 7.2.79, this bug hasn't been fixed.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Trouble-shooting tip: verify that the module you are trying to omni-complete can be imported by VIM. I had some syntactically correct Python that VIM didn't like:</p>

<pre><code>:python import {module-name}
 Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "&lt;string&gt;", line 1, in ?
   File "modulename/__init__.py", line 9
     class empty_paranthesis():
                            ^
 SyntaxError: invalid syntax
</code></pre>

<p>Case-in-point, removing the parenthesis from my class definition allowed VIM to import the module, and subsequently OmniComplete on that module started to work.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I think your after the <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=850" rel="nofollow">pydiction</a> script. It lets you add your own stuff and site-packages to omni complete. </p>

<p>While your at it, add the following to your python.vim file...</p>

<pre><code> set iskeyword+=.
</code></pre>

<p>This will let you auto-complete package functions e.g. if you enter...</p>

<pre><code> os.path.
</code></pre>

<p>and then [CTRL][N], you'll get a list of the functions for os.path.</p>
