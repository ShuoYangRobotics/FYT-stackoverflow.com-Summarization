<h3>Question (ID-2305026):</h3><h2>Is there a open-search solution for python?</h2><p>lucene-like would be preferred.</p>

<p>thanks</p>

<p>It is great and builds against the latest build of lucene</p>

<p>quote from site:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PyLucene is a Python extension for
  accessing Java Lucene. Its goal is to
  allow you to use Lucene's text
  indexing and searching capabilities
  from Python. It is API compatible with
  the latest version of Java Lucene,
  version 2.9.0 as of October 13th,
  2009.</p>
  
  <p>PyLucene is not a Lucene port but a
  Python wrapper around Java Lucene.
  PyLucene embeds a Java VM with Lucene
  into a Python process. The PyLucene
  Python extension, a Python module
  called lucene, is machine-generated by
  JCC.</p>
  
  <p>PyLucene is built with JCC, a C++ code
  generator that makes it possible to
  call into Java classes from Python via
  Java's Native Invocation Interface
  (JNI). Sources for JCC are included
  with the PyLucene sources.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You can also check <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.com">ElasticSearch</a>, it has native JSON interface so integrating with it in python should be simpler. Seems like <a href="http://simonwillison.net/2010/Feb/11/elastic/">Simon Willison</a> things it got potential...</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>See <strong><a href="http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolPython" rel="nofollow">SolPython</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://code.google.com/p/solrpy/" rel="nofollow">solrpy</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>What is solrpy?</h2>
  
  <p>solrpy is a python client for solr, an
  enterprise search server built on top
  of lucene. solrpy allows you to add
  documents to a solr instance, and then
  to perform queries and gather search
  results from solr using your favorite
  programming language--python.</p>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>How about <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/pylucene/" rel="nofollow">python bindings for Lucene</a>?</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>How about Sphinx? <a href="http://www.sphinxsearch.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sphinxsearch.com/</a></p>

<p>It has Python bindings included.
I don't have comparision with other solutions like Lucene, 
but I'm using Sphinx for CRM and it works very well, 
indexing emails, notes etc.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p><a href="http://xapian.org/" rel="nofollow">Xapian</a> is an excellent Lucene-alternative, with fairly good Python-bindings, which is also easier to install than pylucene.</p>
