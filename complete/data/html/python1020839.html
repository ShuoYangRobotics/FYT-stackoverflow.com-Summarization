<h3>Question (ID-1020839):</h3><h2>How to make a simple command-line chat in Python?</h2><p>I study network programming and would like to write a simple command-line chat in Python.</p>

<p>I'm wondering how make receving constant along with inputing available for sending at any time. </p>

<p>As you see, this client can do only one job at a time:</p>

<pre><code>from socket import *

HOST = 'localhost'
PORT = 21567
BUFSIZE = 1024
ADDR = (HOST, PORT)

tcpCliSock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
tcpCliSock.connect(ADDR)

while 1:
    data = raw_input('&gt; ')
    if not data: break
    tcpCliSock.send(data)
    data = tcpCliSock.recv(BUFSIZE)
    if not data: break
    print data

tcpCliSock.close()
</code></pre>

<p>So if another client sends a message, this client will only receive it after sending a message too. I bet you understand me. I have googled for the matter and found out many interesting things such as asynchronous I/O, threading, non-blocking synchronization, concurrent programming and so on. I have also installed the twisted package. In brief, I've been learning all these things but yet haven't found what I was looking for. (Of course, I will keep trying and trying until I get to the point.)</p>

<p>So, my question is how make that? =)  </p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>If you want to code it from scratch <code>select</code> is the way to go (and you can read on Google Book Search most of the chapter of Python in a Nutshell that covers such matters); if you want to leverage more abstraction, <code>asyncore</code> is usable, but <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/" rel="nofollow">Twisted</a> is much richer and more powerful.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You should use <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/2/select" rel="nofollow">select</a>.</p>

<p>Check:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://docs.python.org/library/select.html" rel="nofollow">Another select link</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amk.ca/python/howto/sockets/" rel="nofollow">howto</a></li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I wrote one in async I/O...  its a lot easier to wrap your head around than a full threading model.</p>

<p>if you can get your hands ahold of "talk"'s source code, you can learn a lot about it.  see a demo <a href="http://dsl.org/cookbook/cookbook_40.html#SEC559" rel="nofollow">http://dsl.org/cookbook/cookbook_40.html#SEC559</a> , or try it your self if you are on a linux box...</p>

<p>it sends characters in real-time.</p>

<p>also, ytalk is interactive and multiple users....   kinda like hudddlechat or campfire.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Chat programs are doing two things concurrently.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Watching the local user's keyboard and sending to the remote user (via a socket of some kind)</p></li>
<li><p>Watching the remote socket and displaying what they type on the local console.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You have several ways to do this.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A program that opens socket and keyboard and uses the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/select.html" rel="nofollow">select</a> module to see which one has input ready.</p></li>
<li><p>A program that creates two threads.  One threads reads the remote socket and prints.  The other thread reads the keyboard and sends to the remote socket.</p></li>
<li><p>A program that forks two subprocesses.  One subprocess reads the remote socket and prints.  The other subprocess reads the keyboard and sends to the remote socket.</p></li>
</ol>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Well, well, here's what I am having at this very moment.</p>

<p>Server goes like this:</p>

<pre><code>import asyncore
import socket

clients = {}

class MainServerSocket(asyncore.dispatcher):
    def __init__(self, port):
        asyncore.dispatcher.__init__(self)
        self.create_socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        self.bind(('',port))
        self.listen(5)
    def handle_accept(self):
        newSocket, address = self.accept( )
        clients[address] = newSocket
        print "Connected from", address
        SecondaryServerSocket(newSocket)

class SecondaryServerSocket(asyncore.dispatcher_with_send):
    def handle_read(self):
        receivedData = self.recv(8192)
        if receivedData:
            every = clients.values()
            for one in every:
                one.send(receivedData+'\n')
        else: self.close( )
    def handle_close(self):
        print "Disconnected from", self.getpeername( )
        one = self.getpeername( )
        del clients[one]

MainServerSocket(21567)
asyncore.loop( )
</code></pre>

<p>And client goes just like this:</p>

<pre><code>from Tkinter import *
from socket import *
import thread

HOST = 'localhost'
PORT = 21567
BUFSIZE = 1024
ADDR = (HOST, PORT)

tcpCliSock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
tcpCliSock.connect(ADDR)

class Application(Frame):
    def __init__(self, master):
        Frame.__init__(self, master)
        self.grid()
        self.create_widgets()
        self.socket()

    def callback(self, event):
        message = self.entry_field.get()
        tcpCliSock.send(message)

    def create_widgets(self):
        self.messaging_field = Text(self, width = 110, height = 20, wrap = WORD)
        self.messaging_field.grid(row = 0, column = 0, columnspan = 2, sticky = W)

        self.entry_field = Entry(self, width = 92)
        self.entry_field.grid(row = 1, column = 0, sticky = W)
        self.entry_field.bind('&lt;Return&gt;', self.callback)

    def add(self, data):
        self.messaging_field.insert(END, data)

    def socket(self):
        def loop0():
            while 1:
                data = tcpCliSock.recv(BUFSIZE)
                if data: self.add(data)

        thread.start_new_thread(loop0, ())



root = Tk()
root.title("Chat client")
root.geometry("550x260")

app = Application(root)

root.mainloop()

<p>Now it's time to make the code look better and add some functionality.</p>

<p>Thanks for your help, folks!</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Your question was not very coherent. However, your program does not need to be asynchronous at all to attain what you are asking for.</p>

<p>This is a working chat script you originally wanted with minimal changes. It uses 1 thread for receiving and 1 for sending, both using blocking sockets. It is far simpler than using asynchronous methods.</p>

<pre><code>from socket import *
from threading import Thread
import sys

HOST = 'localhost'
PORT = 21567
BUFSIZE = 1024
ADDR = (HOST, PORT)

tcpCliSock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
tcpCliSock.connect(ADDR)

def recv():
    while True:
        data = tcpCliSock.recv(BUFSIZE)
        if not data: sys.exit(0)
        print data

Thread(target=recv).start()
while True:
    data = raw_input('&gt; ')
    if not data: break
    tcpCliSock.send(data)

tcpCliSock.close()
</code></pre>
