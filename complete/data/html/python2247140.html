<h3>Question (ID-2247140):</h3><h2>How can I filter a pcap file by specific protocol using python?</h2><p>I have some pcap files and I want to filter by protocol, i.e., if I want to filter by HTTP  protocol, anything but HTTP packets will remain in the pcap file. </p>

<p>There is a tool called <a href="http://www.opendpi.org/" rel="nofollow">openDPI</a>, and it's perfect for what I need, but there is no wrapper for python language.</p>

<p>Does anyone knows any python modules that can do what I need?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p><strong>Edit 1:</strong></p>

<p>HTTP filtering was just an example, there is a lot of protocols that I want to filter.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong></p>

<p>I tried Scapy, but I don't figure how to filter correctly. The filter only accepts Berkeley Packet Filter expression, i.e., I can't apply a msn, or HTTP, or another specific filter from upper layer. Can anyone help me?</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Something along the lines of</p>

<pre>
from pcapy import open_offline
from impacket.ImpactDecoder import EthDecoder
from impacket.ImpactPacket import IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP

decoder = EthDecoder()

def callback(jdr, data):
    packet = decoder.decode(data)
    child = packet.child()
    if isinstance(child, IP):
        child = packet.child()
        if isinstance(child, TCP):
            if child.get_th_dport() == 80:
                print 'HTTP'

pcap = open_offline('net.cap')
pcap.loop(0, callback)

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>A quick example using Scapy, since I just wrote one:</p>

<pre><code>pkts = rdpcap('packets.pcap')
ports = [80, 25]
filtered = (pkt for pkt in pkts if
    TCP in pkt and
    (pkt[TCP].sport in ports or pkt[TCP].dport in ports))
wrpcap('filtered.pcap', filtered)
</code></pre>

<p>That will filter out packets that are neither HTTP nor SMTP. If you want all the packets <em>but</em> HTTP and SMTP, the third line should be:</p>

<pre><code>filtered = (pkt for pkt in pkts if
    not (TCP in pkt and
    (pkt[TCP].sport in ports or pkt[TCP].dport in ports)))
wrpcap('filtered.pcap', filtered)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I know this is a super-old question, but I just ran across it thought I'd provide <strong><em>my</em></strong> answer.   This is a problem I've encountered several times over the years, and I keep finding myself falling back to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/dpkt/" rel="nofollow">dpkt</a>.  Originally from the very capable <a href="http://monkey.org/~dugsong/" rel="nofollow">dugsong</a>, dpkt is primarily a packet creation/parsing library.  I get the sense the pcap parsing was an afterthought, but it turns out to be a very useful one, because parsing pcaps, IP, TCP and and TCP headers is straightforward.  It's parsing all the higher-level protocols that becomes the time sink! (I wrote my own python pcap parsing library before finding dpkt)</p>

<p>The documentation on using the pcap parsing functionality is a little thin.  Here's an example from my files:</p>

<pre><code>import socket
import dpkt
import sys
pcapReader = dpkt.pcap.Reader(file(sys.argv[1], "rb"))
for ts, data in pcapReader:
    ether = dpkt.ethernet.Ethernet(data)
    if ether.type != dpkt.ethernet.ETH_TYPE_IP: raise
    ip = ether.data
    src = socket.inet_ntoa(ip.src)
    dst = socket.inet_ntoa(ip.dst)
    print "%s -&gt; %s" % (src, dst)
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps the next guy to run across this post!</p>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>to filter in/out a specific protocol you have to do a per packet analysis otherwise you could miss some http traffic on a non-conventional port that is flowing in your network. of course if you want a loose system, you could check just for source and destination port number but that wont give you exact results. you have to look for specific feature of a protocol like GET, POST, HEAD etc keywords for HTTP and others for other protocol and check each TCP packets.</p>
