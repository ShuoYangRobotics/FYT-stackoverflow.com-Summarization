<h3>Question (ID-965694):</h3><h2>What's the official way of storing settings for python programs?</h2><p>Django uses real Python files for settings, Trac uses a .ini file, and some other pieces of software uses XML files to hold this information.</p>

<p>Are one of these approaches blessed by Guido and/or the Python community more than another?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-9):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Depends on the predominant intended audience.</p>

<p>If it is programmers who change the file anyway, just use python files like settings.py</p>

<p>If it is end users then, think about ini files.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>As many have said, there is no "offical" way.  There are, however, many choices.  There was <a href="http://blip.tv/pycon-us-videos-2009-2010-2011/a-configuration-comparison-in-python-2006550" rel="nofollow">a talk at PyCon</a> this year about many of the available options.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I am not sure that there is an 'official' way (it is not mentioned in the Zen of Python :) )- I tend to use the Config Parser module myself and I think that you will find that pretty common. I prefer that over the python file approach because you can write back to it and dynamically reload if you want.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Just one more option, PyQt. Qt has a platform independent way of storing settings with the QSettings class. Underneath the hood, on windows it uses the registry and in linux it stores the settings in a hidden conf file. QSettings works very well and is pretty seemless.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>It depends largely on how complicated your configuration is. If you're doing a simple key-value mapping and you want the capability to edit the settings with a text editor, I think ConfigParser is the way to go. </p>

<p>If your settings are complicated and include lists and nested data structures, I'd use XML or JSON and create a configuration editor. </p>

<p>For really complicated  things where the end user isn't expected to change the settings much, or is more trusted, just create a set of Python classes and evaluate a Python script to get the configuration.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Don't know if this can be considered "official", but it is in standard library: <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/configparser.html" rel="nofollow">14.2. ConfigParser — Configuration file parser</a>.</p>

<p>This is, obviously, <em>not</em> an universal solution, though. Just use whatever feels most appropriate to the task, without any necessary complexity (and — especially — Turing-completeness! Think about automatic or GUI configurators).</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I use a shelf ( <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/shelve.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/library/shelve.html</a> ):</p>

<pre><code>shelf = shelve.open(filename)
shelf["users"] = ["David", "Abraham"]
shelf.sync() # Save
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>why would Guido blessed something that is out of his scope? No there is nothing particular blessed.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>It is more of convenience. There is no official way per say. But using XML files would make sense as they can be manipulated by various other applications/libraries.</p>
