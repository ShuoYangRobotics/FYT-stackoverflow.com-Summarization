<h3>Question (ID-575196):</h3><h2>In Python, why can a function modify some arguments as perceived by the caller, but not others?</h2><p>I'm new to Python and am trying to understand its approach to variable scope. In this example, why is <code>f()</code> able to alter the value of <code>x</code>, as perceived within <code>main()</code>, but not the value of <code>n</code>?</p>

<pre><code>def f(n, x):
    n = 2
    x.append(4)
    print 'In f():', n, x

def main():
    n = 1
    x = [0,1,2,3]
    print 'Before:', n, x
    f(n, x)
    print 'After: ', n, x

main()
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>Before: 1 [0, 1, 2, 3]
In f(): 2 [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
After:  1 [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Python doesn't copy <em>objects</em> you pass during a function call <em>ever</em>.</strong></p>

<p>Function parameters are <em>names</em>. When you call a function Python binds these parameters to whatever objects you pass (via names in a caller scope).</p>

<p>Objects can be mutable (like lists) or immutable (like integers, strings in Python). Mutable object you can change. You can't change a name, you just can bind it to another object.</p>

<p>Your example is not about <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/classes.html#python-scopes-and-name-spaces" rel="nofollow">scopes or namespaces</a>, it is about <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/executionmodel.html#naming-and-binding" rel="nofollow">naming and binding</a> and <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html#objects-values-and-types" rel="nofollow">mutability of an object</a> in Python. </p>

<pre><code>def f(n, x): # these `n`, `x` have nothing to do with `n` and `x` from main()
    n = 2    # put `n` label on `2` balloon
    x.append(4) # call `append` method of whatever object `x` is referring to.
    print 'In f():', n, x
    x = []   # put `x` label on `[]` ballon
    # the above has no effect on the original list
</code></pre>

<p>Here's nice pictures on <a href="http://python.net/~goodger/projects/pycon/2007/idiomatic/handout.html#other-languages-have-variables" rel="nofollow">the difference between variables in other languages and names in Python</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><code>f</code> doesn't actually alter the value of <code>x</code> (which is always the same reference to an instance of a list). Rather, it alters the <em>contents</em> of this list.</p>

<p>In both cases, a <em>copy</em> is passed to the function. But since <code>x</code> is a reference to a list instance, only the reference is copied, not the contents of the list.</p>

<p>In case you are familiar with C, the following approaches the semantics of the Python code:</p>

<pre><code>void f(int n, int* x) {
    n = 42;
    x[0] = 2;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here, <code>n</code> is an <code>int</code> and <code>x</code> is an <code>int*</code> but both are passed as a copy to the function. Nontheless, the memory <em>pointed to</em> by <code>x</code> is the same at the sides of the caller and the callee.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I will rename variables to reduce confusion.  <em>n</em> -> <em>nf</em> or <em>nmain</em>.  <em>x</em> -> <em>xf</em> or <em>xmain</em>:</p>

<pre><code>def f(nf, xf):
    nf = 2
    xf.append(4)
    print 'In f():', nf, xf

def main():
    nmain = 1
    xmain = [0,1,2,3]
    print 'Before:', nmain, xmain
    f(nmain, xmain)
    print 'After: ', nmain, xmain

main()
</code></pre>

<p>When you call the function <em>f</em>, the Python runtime makes a copy of <em>xmain</em> and assigns it to <em>xf</em>, and similarly assigns a copy of  <em>nmain</em> to <em>nf</em>.</p>

<p>In the case of <em>n</em>, the value that is copied is 1.</p>

<p>In the case of <em>x</em> the value that is copied is <strong>not</strong> the literal list <em>[0, 1, 2, 3]</em>.  It is a <strong>reference</strong> to that list.  <em>xf</em> and <em>xmain</em> are pointing at the same list, so when you modify <em>xf</em> you are also modifying <em>xmain</em>.</p>

<p>If, however, you were to write something like:</p>

<pre><code>    xf = ["foo", "bar"]
    xf.append(4)
</code></pre>

<p>you would find that <em>xmain</em> has not changed.  This is because, in the line <em>xf = ["foo", "bar"]</em> you have change <em>xf</em> to point to a <strong>new</strong> list.  Any changes you make to this new list will have no effects on the list that <em>xmain</em> still points to.</p>

<p>Hope that helps.  :-)</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>n is an int (immutable), and a copy is passed to the function, so in the function you are changing the copy.</p>

<p>X is a list (mutable), and a copy of <em>the pointer</em> is passed o the function so x.append(4) changes the contents of the list.  However, you you said x = [0,1,2,3,4] in your function, you would not change the contents of x in main().</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You've got a number of answers already, and I broadly agree with J.F. Sebastian, but you might find this useful as a shortcut:</p>

<p>Any time you see <strong><code>varname =</code></strong>, you're creating a <em>new</em> name binding within the function's scope.  Whatever value <code>varname</code> was bound to before is lost <em>within this scope</em>.</p>

<p>Any time you see <strong><code>varname.foo()</code></strong> you're calling a method on <code>varname</code>.  The method may alter varname (e.g. <code>list.append</code>).  <code>varname</code> (or, rather, the object that <code>varname</code> names) may exist in more than one scope, and since it's the same object, any changes will be visible in all scopes.</p>

<p>[note that the <code>global</code> keyword creates an exception to the first case]</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>It´s because a list is a mutable object. You´re not setting x to the value of [0,1,2,3], you´re defining a label to the object [0,1,2,3].</p>

<p>You should declare your function f() like this:</p>

<pre><code>def f(n, x=None):
    if x is None:
        x = []
    ...
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Python is a pure pass-by-value language if you think about it the right way.  A python variable stores the location of an object in memory.  The Python variable does not store the object itself.  When you pass a variable to a function, you are passing a <em>copy</em> of the address of the object being pointed to by the variable.  </p>

<p>Contrasst these two functions</p>

<pre><code>def foo(x):
    x[0] = 5

def goo(x):
    x = []
</code></pre>

<p>Now, when you type into the shell</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; cow = [3,4,5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo(cow)
&gt;&gt;&gt; cow
[5,4,5]
</code></pre>

<p>Compare this to goo.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; cow = [3,4,5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; goo(cow)
&gt;&gt;&gt; goo
[3,4,5]
</code></pre>

<p>In the first case, we pass a copy the address of cow to foo and foo modified the state of the object residing there.  The object gets modified.</p>

<p>In the second case you pass a copy of the address of cow to goo. Then goo proceeds to change that copy. Effect: none.</p>

<p>I call this the <em>pink house principle</em>.  If you make a copy of your address and tell a 
painter to paint the house at that address pink, you will wind up with a pink house.
If you give the painter a copy of your address and tell him to change it to a new address,
the address of your house does not change.</p>

<p>The explanation eliminates a lot of confusion.  Python passes the addresses variables store by value.   </p>
