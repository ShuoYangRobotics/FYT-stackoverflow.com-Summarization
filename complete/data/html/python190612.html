<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Python's CPAN-like repository is called <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi" rel="nofollow">PyPi</a>, and is chock full of examples! You can browse packages by topic, which is helpful if you know what sort of program you're looking to write.</p>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The most comprehensive list of Python wins is at the <a href="http://www.python.org/" rel="nofollow">Python web site</a>, under <a href="http://www.python.org/about/success/" rel="nofollow">Python Success Stories</a>.</p>

<p>Google, Yahoo, Washington Post web site, Plone content management system, Zope portal framework/application, etc.</p>

<p>Google and Yahoo originally rolled out much of their functionality written in Python.  Where performance was an issue (obviously, the search engine party) they reprogrammed it in C or C++.</p>

<p>However, much of the non-performance critical modules today remain written in Python.  When you are on these sites checking online help or doing some social/portal thing, take a look in the URL of the page you are looking at and see if there is a ".py" in there somewhere.</p>

<p>Google's new Application Engine is 100% Python.  It is not just old functionality but also new functionality that is being coded in Python.</p>

<p>Google has made their development practices/philosophy pretty transparent to the outside world.  They are very knowledgeable people, generally - and their programmers are encouraged to use a language that is a good fit for the software they are creating.</p>

<p>Many software projects managed/organized/monitored by Trac.  Trac is written in Python.</p>

<p>Someone blogged a list of popular Python applications in <a href="http://www.aminus.org/blogs/index.php/2006/01/04/how_python_wins_on_the_web?blog=15" rel="nofollow">How Python wins the web</a>.</p>

<p>As an aside, Python won <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/10065" rel="nofollow">readers choice award in 2008</a> for Favorite Scripting Language.  The survey was put out by Linux Journal magazine.</p>

<p>Python is used both in the client and on the server.</p>
