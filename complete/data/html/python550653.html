<h3>Question (ID-550653):</h3><h2>Cross-platform way to get PIDs by process name in python</h2><p>Several processes with the same name are running on host. What is the cross-platform way to get PIDs of that processes by name using <strong>python</strong> or <strong>jython</strong>?</p>

<ol>
<li>It's like pidof but in python (I don't have pidof anyway).</li>
<li>I can't parse /proc because it might be unavailable (on HP-UX).</li>
<li>I do not want to run os.popen('ps') and parse the output because I think it is ugly (field sequence may be different in different OS).</li>
<li>Target platforms are Solaris, HP-UX, and maybe others.</li>
</ol>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You can use psutil (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/psutil">http://code.google.com/p/psutil</a>) which works on Windows and UNIX:</p>

<pre>
import psutil

PROCNAME = "python.exe"

for proc in psutil.process_iter():
    if proc.name == PROCNAME:
        print proc
</pre>

<p>The code above on my machines  prints:</p>

<pre>
psutil.Process (PID:2908; PPID:3944; NAME:'python.exe'; PATH:'C:\Python26'; CMDL
INE:['C:\\Python26\\python.exe', 'D:\\pyftpdlib\\svn\\psutil\\foo.py']; UID:-1;
GID:-1;)
</pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>There's no single cross-platform API, you'll have to check for OS. For posix based use /proc. For Windows use following code to get list of all pids with coresponding process names</p>

<pre><code>from win32com.client import GetObject
WMI = GetObject('winmgmts:')
processes = WMI.InstancesOf('Win32_Process')
process_list = [(p.Properties_("ProcessID").Value, p.Properties_("Name").Value) for p in processes]
</code></pre>

<p>You can then easily filter out processes you need.

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I don't think you will be able to find a purely python-based, portable solution without using /proc or command line utilities, at least not in python itself. Parsing os.system is not ugly - someone has to deal with the multiple platforms, be it you or someone else. Implementing it for the OS you are interested in should be fairly easy, honestly.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>First, Windows (in all it's incarnations) is a non-standard OS.</p>

<p>Linux (and most proprietary unixen) are POSIX-compliant standard operating systems.</p>

<p>The C libraries reflect this dichotomy.  Python reflects the C libraries.</p>

<p>There is no "cross-platform" way to do this.  You have to hack up something with <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/lib/module-ctypes.html" rel="nofollow">ctypes</a> for a particular release of Windows (XP or Vista)</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>There isn't, I'm afraid. Processes are uniquely identified by pid not by name. If you really must find a pid by name, then you will have use something like you have suggested, but it won't be portable and probably will not work in all cases.</p>

<p>If you only have to find the pids for a certain application and you have control over this application, then I'd suggest changing this app to store its pid in files in some location where your script can find it.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>For jython, if Java 5 is used, then you can get the Java process id as following:</p>

<p>from java.lang.management import *<br/>
pid = ManagementFactory.getRuntimeMXBean().getName()</p>
