<h3>Question (ID-382603):</h3><h2>When would you use Infinity?</h2><p>So in Ruby there is a trick to specify infinity:</p>

<pre><code>1.0/0
=&gt; Infinity
</code></pre>

<p>I believe in Python you can do something like this</p>

<pre><code>float('inf')
</code></pre>

<p>These are just examples though, I'm sure most languages have infinity in some capacity. When would you actually use this construct in the real world? Why would using it in a range be better than just using a boolean expression? For instance</p>

<pre><code>(0..1.0/0).include?(number) == (number &gt;= 0) # True for all values of number
=&gt; true
</code></pre>

<p>To summarise, what I'm looking for is a real world reason to use Infinity.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I'm looking for real world code. It's all well and good to say this is when you "could" use it, when have people <em>actually</em> used it.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-21):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Dijkstra's Algorithm typically assigns infinity as the initial edge weights in a graph.  This doesn't <em>have</em> to be "infinity", just some arbitrarily constant but in java I typically use Double.Infinity.  I assume ruby could be used similarly.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Off the top of the head, it can be useful as an initial value when searching for a minimum value.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>min = float('inf')

for x in somelist:
  if x&lt;min: 
    min=x
</code></pre>

<p>Which I prefer to setting <code>min</code> initially to the first value of <code>somelist</code></p>

<p>Of course, in Python, you should just use the min() built-in function in most cases.  </p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>There seems to be an implied "Why does this functionality even exist?" in your question.  And the reason is that Ruby and Python are just giving access to the full range of values that one can specify in floating point form as specified by IEEE.  </p>

<p>This page seems to describe it well: 
<a href="http://steve.hollasch.net/cgindex/coding/ieeefloat.html" rel="nofollow">http://steve.hollasch.net/cgindex/coding/ieeefloat.html</a></p>

<p>As a result, you can also have NaN (Not-a-number) values and -0.0, while you may not immediately have real-world uses for those either.  </p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>In some physics calculations you can normalize irregularities (ie, infinite numbers) of the same order with each other, canceling them both and allowing a approximate result to come through.</p>

<p>When you deal with limits, calculations like (infinity / infinity) -> approaching a finite a number could be achieved. It's useful for the language to have the ability to overwrite the regular divide-by-zero error.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Use <code>Infinity</code> and <code>-Infinity</code> when implementing a mathematical algorithm calls for it.</p>

<p>In Ruby, <code>Infinity</code> and <code>-Infinity</code> have nice comparative properties so that <code>-Infinity</code> &lt; <code>x</code> &lt; <code>Infinity</code> for any real number <code>x</code>.  For example, <code>Math.log(0)</code> returns <code>-Infinity</code>, extending to <code>0</code> the property that <code>x &gt; y</code> implies that <code>Math.log(x) &gt; Math.log(y)</code>.  Also, <code>Infinity * x</code> is <code>Infinity</code> if x > 0, <code>-Infinity</code> if x &lt; 0, and 'NaN' (not a number; that is, undefined) if x is 0.</p>

<p>For example, I use the following bit of code in part of the calculation of some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_ratio" rel="nofollow">log likelihood ratios</a>. I explicitly reference <code>-Infinity</code> to define a value even if <code>k</code> is <code>0</code> or <code>n</code> AND <code>x</code> is <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>.  </p>

<pre><code>Infinity = 1.0/0.0
def Similarity.log_l(k, n, x)
  unless x == 0 or x == 1
    k * Math.log(x.to_f) + (n-k) * Math.log(1.0-x)
  end
    -Infinity
  end
end

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I use it to specify the mass and inertia of a static object in physics simulations.  Static objects are essentially unaffected by gravity and other simulation forces.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-beta_pruning" rel="nofollow">Alpha-beta pruning</a></p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>I used it for representing camera focus distance and to my surprise in Python:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; float("inf") is float("inf")
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; float("inf") == float("inf")
True
</code></pre>

<p>I wonder why is that.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>I've used it for cases where you want to define ranges of preferences / allowed.</p>

<p>For example in 37signals apps you have like a limit to project number</p>

<pre><code>Infinity = 1 / 0.0
FREE = 0..1
BASIC = 0..5
PREMIUM = 0..Infinity
</code></pre>

<p>then you can do checks like </p>

<pre><code>if PREMIUM.include? current_user.projects.count 
 # do something
end
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>I use it when I have a Range object where one or both ends need to be open</p>
<br /><b>#10</b><br /><p>I've used it in a DSL similar to Rails' <code>has_one</code> and <code>has_many</code>:</p>

<pre><code>has 0..1 :author
has 0..INFINITY :tags
</code></pre>

<p>This makes it easy to express concepts like Kleene star and plus in your DSL.</p>
<br /><b>#11</b><br /><p>In Ruby infinity can be used to implement lazy lists. Say i want N numbers starting at 200 which get successively larger by 100 units each time:</p>

<pre><code>Inf = 1.0 / 0.0
(200..Inf).step(100).take(N)
</code></pre>

<br /><b>#12</b><br /><p>When working in a problem domain where trig is used (especially tangent) infinity is an answer that can come up.  Trig ends up being used heavily in graphics applications, games, and geospatial applications, plus the obvious math applications.  </p>
<br /><b>#13</b><br /><p>I'm sure there are other ways to do this, but you could use Infinity to check for reasonable inputs in a String-to-Float conversion. In Java, at least, the Float.isNaN() static method will return false for numbers with infinite magnitude, indicating they are valid numbers, even though your program might want to classify them as invalid. Checking against the Float.POSITIVE_INFINITY and Float.NEGATIVE_INFINITY constants solves that problem. For example:</p>

<pre><code>// Some sample values to test our code with
String stringValues[] = {
  "-999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999",
  "12345",
  "999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999"
};

// Loop through each string representation
for (String stringValue : stringValues) {
  // Convert the string representation to a Float representation
  Float floatValue = Float.parseFloat(stringValue);

  System.out.println("String representation: " + stringValue);
  System.out.println("Result of isNaN: " + floatValue.isNaN());

  // Check the result for positive infinity, negative infinity, and
  // "normal" float numbers (within the defined range for Float values).
  if (floatValue == Float.POSITIVE_INFINITY) {
    System.out.println("That number is too big.");
  } else if (floatValue == Float.NEGATIVE_INFINITY) {
    System.out.println("That number is too small.");
  } else {
    System.out.println("That number is jussssst right.");
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Sample Output:</strong></p>

<p>String representation: -999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999<br/>
Result of isNaN: false<br/>
That number is too small.<br/></p>

<p>String representation: 12345<br/>
Result of isNaN: false<br/>
That number is jussssst right.<br/></p>

<p>String representation: 999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999<br/>
Result of isNaN: false<br/>
That number is too big.<br/></p>
<br /><b>#14</b><br /><p>I've used it in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax" rel="nofollow">minimax algorithm</a>. When I'm generating new moves, if the min player wins on that node then the value of the node is -∞. Conversely, if the max player wins then the value of that node is +∞.</p>

<p>Also, if you're generating nodes/game states and then trying out several heuristics you can set all the node values to -∞/+∞ which ever makes sense and then when you're running a heuristic its easy to set the node value:</p>

<pre><code>node_val = -∞
node_val = max(heuristic1(node), node_val)
node_val = max(heuristic2(node), node_val)
node_val = max(heuristic2(node), node_val)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#15</b><br /><p>I've used symbolic values for positive and negative infinity in dealing with range comparisons to eliminate corner cases that would otherwise require special handling:</p>

<p>Given two ranges A=[a,b) and C=[c,d) do they intersect, is one greater than the other, or does one contain the other?</p>

<pre><code>A &gt; C iff a &gt;= d
A &lt; C iff b &lt;= c
etc...
</code></pre>

<p>If you have values for positive and negative infinity that respectively compare greater than and less than all other values, you don't need to do any special handling for open-ended ranges.  Since floats and doubles already implement these values, you might as well use them instead of trying to find the largest/smallest values on your platform.  With integers, it's more difficult to use "infinity" since it's not supported by hardware.</p>
<br /><b>#16</b><br /><p>It is used quite extensively in graphics.  For example, any pixel in a 3D image that is not part of an actual object is marked as infinitely far away.  So that it can later be replaced with a background image.</p>
<br /><b>#17</b><br /><p>I ran across this because I'm looking for an "infinite" value to set for a maximum, if a given value doesn't exist, in an attempt to create a binary tree.  (Because I'm selecting based on a range of values, and not just a single value, I quickly realized that even a hash won't work in my situation.)</p>

<p>Since I expect all numbers involved to be positive, the minimum is easy:  0.  Since I don't know what to expect for a maximum, though, I would like the upper bound to be Infinity of some sort.  This way, I won't have to figure out what "maximum" I should compare things to.</p>

<p>Since this is a project I'm working on at work, it's technically a "Real world problem".  It may be kindof rare, but like a lot of abstractions, it's convenient when you need it!</p>

<p>Also, to those who say that this (and other examples) are contrived, I would point out that <i>all</i> abstractions are somewhat contrived; that doesn't mean they are useful when you contrive them.</p>
<br /><b>#18</b><br /><p>Some programmers use Infinity or <code>NaN</code>s to show a variable has never been initialized or assigned in the program.</p>
<br /><b>#19</b><br /><p>I'm using a network library where you can specify the maximum number of reconnection attempts. Since I want mine to reconnect forever:</p>

<p><code>my_connection = ConnectionLibrary(max_connection_attempts = float('inf'))</code></p>

<p>In my opinion, it's more clear than the typical "set to -1 to retry forever" style, since it's literally saying "retry until the number of connection attempts is greater than infinity".</p>
<br /><b>#20</b><br /><p>You can to use:</p>

<pre><code>import decimal
decimal.Decimal("Infinity")
</code></pre>

<p>or:</p>

<pre><code>from decimal import *
Decimal("Infinity")
</code></pre>
