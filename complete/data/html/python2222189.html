<h3>Question (ID-2222189):</h3><h2>Printing to a file from a list of lists in Python</h2><p>I am trying to print to a file that will look like:</p>

<pre><code>'A'
'1'
'B'
'2'
'C'
'3' 
</code></pre>

<p>Given the code below, however, the result is :</p>

<pre><code>['A']
['B']
['C']
</code></pre>

<p>This is probably a 'softball' question, but what am I doing wrong here?</p>

<pre><code>l1 = ['1']
l2 = ['A']
l3 = ['2']
l4 = ['B']
l5 = ['3']
l6 = ['C']

listoflists = [l1,l2,l3,l4,l5,l6]
itr = iter(listoflists)

f = open ('order.txt','w')

while True: 
    try:
           itr.next()
           s = str(itr.next())
           f.write(str('\n'))
           f.write(s)

    except StopIteration:
        break
f.close()
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>First of all, don't use <code>iter</code> and <code>next()</code>, that's what <code>for</code> is for. Secondly, you are actually writing a list to the file, not its contents. So you could either print the first element of the list (i.e. <code>l1[0]</code>) or iterate through all the inner lists elements.</p>

<p>Your code should look like this:</p>

<pre><code>l1 = ['1']
l2 = ['A']
l3 = ['2']
l4 = ['B']
l5 = ['3']
l6 = ['C']

listoflists = [l1,l2,l3,l4,l5,l6]

f = open ('order.txt','w')

for inner_list in listoflists:
    for element in inner_list:
        f.write(element+'\n')

f.close()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I think the best way to solve this is just with a basic nested loop. Try this:</p>

<pre><code>l1 = ['1']
l2 = ['A']
l3 = ['2']
l4 = ['B']
l5 = ['3']
l6 = ['C']
listoflists = [l1,l2,l3,l4,l5,l6]

f = open("out.txt","w")

# for each list and
# for each item in the list;
# write the item to the file, separated by a comma
for list in listoflists: 
    for item in list: 
        f.write(item+",") 

f.close()
</code></pre>

<p>Out.txt now holds:</p>

<pre><code>1,A,2,B,3,C,
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Oh, and no Python question is complete without a one-liner solution (this also removes the trailing comma from my initial response).</p>

<pre><code>open("out.txt","w").write(",".join(("".join(i) for i in listoflists)))
</code></pre>

<p>Out.txt now holds:</p>

<pre><code>1,A,2,B,3,C
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Your code could be a lot simpler:</p>

<pre><code>for list in listoflists:
    f.write(str(list))
    f.write('\n')
</code></pre>

<p>But, this is going to print something like <code>['1']</code>.  It seems like you want something more like:</p>

<pre><code>for list in listoflists:
    f.write(str(list[0]))
    f.write('\n')
</code></pre>

<p>Also, why do you have a bunch of single-element lists?  Couldn't you put all the elements into one list?</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The simple reason why you are getting the wrong file contents is because you are calling <code>iter</code> twice. Lines 15-16 are:</p>

<pre><code>itr.next()
s = str(itr.next())
</code></pre>

<p>For more Pythonic printing semantics, see the other answers</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Including the quotes in the output is a bit odd, but if you insist:</p>

<pre><code>for entry in listoflists:
  print &gt;&gt;f, repr(entry[0])
</code></pre>

<p>You don't specify what will happen if the inner list does not have just one element, so any other possibility is ignored here.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You can simply iterate through all list elements with <code>itertools.chain</code> (documented <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/itertools.html#itertools.chain" rel="nofollow">here</a>):</p>

<pre><code>import itertools

l1 = ['1']
l2 = ['A']
l3 = ['2']
l4 = ['B']
l5 = ['3']
l6 = ['C']

chainedlists = itertools.chain(l1,l2,l3,l4,l5,l6)

with open ('order.txt','wt') as f:
    for element in chainedlists:
        # Change this how you want it to be formatted, it will output
        # a string "a" as 'a' (with the quotes)
        f.write("%s\n" % repr(element))
</code></pre>
