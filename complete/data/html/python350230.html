<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You probably don't need to pay to learn python. Implementing cellular automata makes for good starting project.  The best place to start with python is the <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/" rel="nofollow">official tutorial</a> and you can follow that with <a href="http://www.diveintopython.org/" rel="nofollow">dive into python</a>.</p>

<p>The answers <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/348506/starting-from-scratchi-need-some-direction">here</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/348376/intro-book-on-cs-for-girlfriend">here</a> may be helpful as well.</p>

<p>If you can bear the self-praising and claims to godness <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1579550088" rel="nofollow">Wolfram's book</a> is a good way to get a feel for cellular automata, but don't take the book itself too seriously (that's a separate issue that can fill several blog posts). He also has a <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0201626640" rel="nofollow">set of papers</a> on this stuff that is published as a book that goes into all the details.  And of course if you just google for cellular automata and Conway's game you'll find a myriad of implementations and explanations.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You'll probably get some good documentation here : <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085959/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085959/</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I happened to post a <a href="http://www.thinkbottomup.com.au/site/blog/Game_of_Life_in_XAML_WPF_using_embedded_Python" rel="nofollow">blog</a> on implementing John Conway's Game of Life in XAML/WPF using embedded Python.  It might be of interest to you.</p>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>There's a few people on the pygame.org website who've done their versions of the game of life. Maybe they'll be of help:
