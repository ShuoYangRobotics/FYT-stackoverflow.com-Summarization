<h3>Question (ID-7908802):</h3><h2>Python: Define a function using a variable?</h2><p>I am trying to define a function that will include a variable <code>n</code> where <code>n</code> will be a string of numbers e.g. <code>"3884892993"</code>, the definition of the function starts as <code>is_true(n)</code>, however if n is going to be a string should it be <code>is_true(n)</code> and then once the string is defined I can test the function with an example string such as <code>n = "3884892993"</code>. I get a syntax error when I use <code>is_true(n)</code> however. And I am just wondering how I would go about testing this function with an example string for n.</p>

<p>My entire function to define is shown here: <a href="http://oi44.tinypic.com/282i3qo.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://oi44.tinypic.com/282i3qo.jpg</a> but bear in mind I am an absolute novice so there will most probably be many mistakes, but I would appreciate some help from some experts if at all possible :)</p>

<pre><code>def is_valid("n"): #n is the number to be checked.
    number = 
    [int(y) for y in A] #converts the string into a list of useable digits.
    altern1 = integer[-2::-2] #sets altern1 as one set of alternating digits.
    double = [x*2 for x in altern1] #doubles each element of the list altern1.
    sum1 = sum(double) # adds together all the doubled items of the list.
    altern2 = integer[-1::-2] #sets altern2 as the other set of alternating digits.
    return sum2 = sum(altern2)#sums the other set of alternating digits.
    sumtotal = sum1 + sum2 #works out the total sum to be worked with.
    for mod = sumtotal % 10: #works out remainder when sumtotal is divided by 10
        if mod == 0 : #if remainder is zero sumtotal is a multiple of 10
            print 'True' #sumtotal is a multiple of 10 therefore n is a credit card number
        else:
            print 'False' #sumtotal is NOT a multiple of 10 therefore not a valid credit card number
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Here is the actual question:</strong></p>

<p>The algorithm for verifying a number is as follows:
(a) Starting with the penultimate digit, and working towards the rst digit, double each alternating digit.
(b) Sum the doubled digits, treating 13 as 1+3, etc, and add the result to the sum of the undoubled
digits
(c) If the sum is divisible by 10 the number is a valid credit card number.</p>

<p>Write and test a function is_valid() which takes as an argument a credit card number as a string
(eg is valid("49927398716")) and returns True or False depending on whether the number is a
valid credit card number.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Quotes are only used for string literals, you wouldn't enclose a variable or parameter name in quotes to indicate that it will be a string.  The function definition would look like:</p>

<pre><code>def is_true(n):
</code></pre>

<p>And then in the body of the function you use <code>n</code> to reference the value that is passed in by the caller.</p>

<p>To call the function on a specific value, you do:</p>

<pre><code>is_true("3884892993")
</code></pre>

<p>Side suggestion:  Think of more explanatory names for your functions and variables.  For instance, it seems like your function might be reasonably called <code>is_valid_card_number</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I am not sure what is your question, but if you are trying to:</p>

<ul>
<li>correctly define the function:
<ul>
<li>pay attention to the indentation (this is required by Python!),</li>
<li>see <a href="http://docs.python.org/release/2.5.2/ref/function.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> for examples of function definitions,</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>convert a string variable into integer, you can do this:</p>

<pre><code>new_var = int(old_var)
</code></pre>

<p>Generally please pay attention to types, because it is not like in some other dynamically typed languages and strings are not dynamically converted into numbers - you should do it explicitly.</p></li>
<li><p>read the value of the variable, based on its name:</p>

<pre><code>my_var = vars().get('variable_name')
</code></pre>

<p>(where <code>variable_name</code> is the name of the variable and optionally you can give context within brackets after <code>vars</code> - see <code>help(vars)</code> for details)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Did any of the above solve your problem?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT (based on the clarification):</strong></p>

<p>This should solve your problem:</p>

<pre><code>def is_true(my_variable):
    # Here the variable named "my_variable" is accessible
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to do something "in-place" on the passed variable, I have a bad news: <strong>strings and integers are immutable in Python</strong>, thus you are not able to simply change them - you should probably return them as a result of the function (there are at least two workarounds, but I do not recommend them if you are a novice in Python).</p>

<p><strong>EDIT (for proper code styling):</strong></p>

<p>You should probably read <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow">PEP 8</a> to get familiar with what is the coding standard for Python scripts - this is commonly used across Python community and you should follow that (at some point you should appreciate it).</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I have no idea what your function is supposed to do, but here are some remarks.</p>

<p>First of all, if you define the function then you use the following syntax</p>

<pre><code>def is_true(n):
    # do something
</code></pre>

<p>you can call this function like this <code>is_true("3884892993")</code>, i.e. you can pass string as <code>n</code>. Your function now need to treat variable <code>n</code> as a string. So you can use</p>

<pre><code>number = [int(d) for d in n]
</code></pre>

<p>which will result in converting string into a list of digits.</p>

<p>One more remark: you used a <code>return</code> statement inside your <code>is_true</code> function. This statement will stop executing the function and return the value. Every code below <code>return</code> will never be executed.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>From the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia article on the Luhn algorithm</a>:</p>

<pre><code>def is_luhn_valid(cc):
    num = map(int, str(cc))
    return sum(num[::-2] + [sum(divmod(d * 2, 10)) for d in num[-2::-2]]) % 10 == 0
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>May be like this. I leave your comments</p>

<pre><code>def is_valid(n): #n is the number to be checked.
    numbers = [int(y) for y in n] #converts the string into a list of useable digits.
    double_alt = [sum([int(i) for i in str(x*2)]) for x in numbers[-2::-2]]   #doubles      and sum if more than 10each element of the list altern1.
    sum1 = sum(double_alt) # adds together all the doubled items of the list.
    sum2 = sum(numbers[-1::-2]) #sums the other set of alternating digits.
    sumtotal = sum1 + sum2 #works out the total sum to be worked with.
    return not sumtotal % 10
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Here an implementation of the luhn algorithm that I had to make recently.</p>

<pre><code>def is_valid_luhn(cc):
    return not sum([sum(divmod(int(d) * 2, 10)) for d in cc[-2::-2]] + [int(d) for d in cc[-1::-2]]) % 10
    #                          | double |       |--- every -2th --|            |--- every -1th --|
    #                          |--------- step 1 -----------------|
    #              |------------- sum doubled digits --------------|   |-- sum undoubled digits --|
    #          |---------------------- step 2: sum doubled/undoubled digits -----------------------|
    #      |-------------------------- step 3: sum % 10 == 0 --&gt; not sum % 10 --------------------------|
</code></pre>

<p>Or if you'd like a more verbose version:</p>

<pre><code>def is_valid_luhn(cc):
    total = 0
    # Double and sum every 2nd digit starting at -2.
    for d in cc[-2::-2]:
        # divmod(d*2, 10) returns (d*2 // 10, d*2 % 10)
        # sum(divmod) return (d*2 // 10) + (d*2 % 10)
        total += sum(divmod(int(d) * 2, 10))
    # Sum every 2nd digit starting at -1.
    for d in cc[-1::-2]:
        total += int(d)
    # Check module 10 of total: total % 10 == 0 --&gt; not total % 10
    return not total % 10
</code></pre>
