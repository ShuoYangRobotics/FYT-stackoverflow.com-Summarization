<h3>Question (ID-2912944):</h3><h2>Simple multilingual CMS?</h2><p>I have been searching for a while now for a dead simple CMS with multi-language support. The ideal candidate is very lean and offers the possibility to set up different languages for different domains. It's OK if the language support is provided by a plugin/extension.</p>

<p>For example I want example.com to point to English and example.fr should be French. With different URI-mappings for SEO.</p>

<p>It can be developed in either of PHP, Ruby or Python and has to be open source.</p>

<p>Any tips?<br>
Thank you</p>

<p><strong>EDIT / MORE DETAILS</strong><br>
What I want is a CMS that is as simple to use and grasp for a client as Radiant is, but with tabs on each resource that can translate articles to different languages.</p>

<p>Languages have to be able to use multiple domains, one for each language.</p>

<p>I want to easily use the same article for more than one language as well as have articles (e.g. blog posts or news stories) that are only connected to one language.</p>

<p>The CMS should be very light in core functionality (like Radiant, unlike Drupal/Joomla) but be easily extendable with plugins.</p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I suggest <strong>SilverStripe CMS</strong></p>

<p>And for the support of different domains take a look at the <strong>Subsites Module</strong> for SSCMS

<p>The SSCMS is based on Sapphire Framework, it is very easy to extend and customize the functionality.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I've looked for a PHP based CMS which supports multilingual text content, but I couldn't find solution that meets my needs.</p>

<p>From my experience I suggest to use <a href="http://django-cms.org" rel="nofollow">Django CMS</a> it is very easy if you know <a href="http://djangoproject.com" rel="nofollow">Django</a> basics and it supports mulitlanguage content nicely.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Joomla is an award-winning content
  management system (CMS), which enables
  you to build Web sites and powerful
  online applications. Many aspects,
  including its ease-of-use and
  extensibility, have made Joomla the
  most popular Web site software
  available. Best of all, Joomla is an
  open source solution that is freely
  available to everyone.</p>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>It's not a prepackaged CMS but Globalize <a href="http://github.com/joshmh/globalize2" rel="nofollow">http://github.com/joshmh/globalize2</a> gives you great power and flexibility in internationalizing a Ruby on Rails application.</p>
