<h3>Question (ID-3427795):</h3><h2>are there tutorials on how to name variables?</h2><p>as you can probably tell from my previous posts i have horrific naming conventions. do you know of any tutorials dealing with how to name stuff?</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I don't think there will be any good tutorials, because there aren't any hard-and-fast rules. Here are some tips:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Conform to convention: Loop variables are <code>i</code>, <code>j</code>, and <code>k</code>; variable numbers of arguments go in <code>*args</code> and <code>**kwargs</code>; use camelCase or underscored_names.</p></li>
<li><p>Be consistent.</p></li>
<li><p>Be concise. <code>list_of_drugs_used_in_this_program</code> is much less clear than <code>drugs</code>. Similarly, you don't need to include the datatype of the variable in the name: <code>drugs_list</code> is redundant.</p></li>
<li><p>Don't go overboard with the underscores. I've never needed more than one. 2+ is pushing it.</p></li>
<li><p>Never ever <em>ever</em> use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasyntactic_variable" rel="nofollow">metasyntactic variables</a> (<code>foo</code>, <code>spam</code>...) in anything but quick-and-dirty examples. <code>method1</code> is also out.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>But you could summarise all of that with:</p>

<h2>Don't be silly.</h2>

  <p>Variable naming conventions can often
  turn into a religious war, but I’m
  entirely confident when I declare The
  World’s Worst Variable Name to be:</p>

<pre><code>$data
</code></pre>
  
  <p>Of course it’s data! That’s what
  variables contain! That’s all they
  ever can contain. It’s like you’re
  packing up your belongings to move to
  a new house, and on the side of the
  box you write, in big black marker,
  “matter.”</p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>All the answers here are quite valid. Most important: be consistent.</p>

<p>That said, here are my rules (C#):</p>

<ul>
<li>camelCase identifiers -- I personally
find this much easier to read than
underscores </li>
<li><code>Public</code> properties start
with a capital letter</li>
<li>Something I
should never touch starts with an
underscore -- example, the backing
field to a property should only be
touched from the property. If I have
underscores elsewhere, I know I'm
wrong</li>
<li>Apps Hungarian where
appropriate -- ints describing row
IDs perhaps could be named
<code>rowSelected</code>, <code>rowNextUnread</code>, et
cetera. This is different than
Systems Hungarian, which would mark
them as ints such as <code>iSelected</code>,
<code>iNextUnread</code>. Systems Hungarian
doesn't add much if anything, where
Apps Hungarian gives information the
type doesn't: it tells me adding
<code>rowItemsPerPage</code> and <code>colSelected</code> is a
meaningless operation, even though it
compiles just fine.</li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><ol>
<li>A bad convention followed fully is better than a combination of different good "conventions" (which aren't conventions at all any more, if they aren't kept to).</li>
<li>However, a convention that is making something less clear than if it had been ignored, should be ignored.</li>
</ol>

<p>Those are the only two I would state as any sort of rule. Beyond that convention preferences are a matter of opinions quickly turning into rants. The rest of this post is exactly that, and shouldn't be read as anything else.</p>

<ol>
<li>For collections, use natural language plurals. In English, this means data, schemata, children, indices, criteria, formulae (and indeed foci, geese, feet, men, women, teeth) not made-up words like datums schemas, childs, indexes, criterions, formulas (and likewise focuses, gooses, foots, mans, womans, tooths, believe it or not I've actually seen some of those in use). Camel-casing and abbreviatiating does enough damage to English as it is, without doing more. Okay, I've never seen datums, but I have seen the meta-plural datas. Sweet Aradia, why?</li>
<li>That said, use American English for names, even if you use a different dialect of English. Most coders with such dialects have learnt to think of "color" as a word for colours in a computer context by the age of 12, and the principle applies more widely. If we can deal with "color" (one of Webster's worse bastardisations) we can deal with -ize and -ization (-ise and -isation is a pseudo-French 18th C affectation anyway, the Americans are the traditionalists on this one).</li>
<li>Similarly, if you aren't sure how to spell a word that you are using as the whole or part of a name, look it up (google it and see what google says). Somebody may spend a long time distracted by your misspelling that is so liberally distributed throughout running code as to make fixing it daunting.</li>
<li>Hungarian is bad (in many modern languages, though in some it has its place) but the principle is good. If you can tell a const, static, instance, local and parameter variable from each other in a split-second, that's good. If you can tell something of the intent immediately, that's good too.</li>
<li>Related to that, _ before public variables makes them non CLR compiant. That's actually a good thing for private variables (if you make them public for a quick experiment, and forget to fix the visibility, the compiler will warn you).</li>
<li>Remember Postel's Law, "be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others". One example of this is to act as if you are using a case-sensitive langauge, even if you're using a case-insensitive one. A related one is to be more of a stickler in public names than private ones. Yet another is to pay more attention to following conventions well than to complaining about those who don't.</li>
</ol>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Not a tutorial... more like a guide/best practice kind of thing:<br />

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I'd recommend purchasing a copy of "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin. It is full of great suggstions ranging from naming conventions to how to write easy-to-understand functions and much more. Definitely worth a read. I know it influenced my coding style since reading it.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>hi for me you should always put the most explicit names:</p>

<pre><code>string_to_hash = "blabla"
hash(sring_to_hash)
</code></pre>

<p>and respect the <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow">pep8</a> style guide. You code should then be very easy to read.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>There are many different views on the specifics of naming conventions, but the overall gist could be summed up as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Each variable name should be <strong>relevant</strong>
  to whatever data is stored in the
  variable. </p>
  
  <p>Your naming scheme should be <strong>consistent</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So a major no-no would be
single letter variables (some people
use i and j for indexing loops, which
is OK because every programmer knows
what they are. Nevertheless, I prefer
'idx' instead of 'i'). Also out are
names like 'method1', it means nothing
- it should indicate what the variable holds.</p>

<p>Another (less common) convention is the 'Hungarian' notation where the data type is prefixed to the variable name such as 'int i_idx'. This is quite useless in modern, object oriented programming languages. Not to mention a blatant violation of the DRY principle.</p>

<p>The second point, consistency, is just as important. camelCase, UpperCamelCase, whatever - just don't switch between them for no reason.</p>

<p>You'll find that naming conventions vary from language to language and often, a company will have their own rules on naming. </p>

<p>Its a worthwhile investment to properly name your variables because when you come to maintain your code much later on and you have forgotten what everything means, it will pay dividends.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>You didn't specify what language are you looking for. Since your question is flagged .NET, here is a document I follow when writing  C# code: <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/lhunt/pages/CSharp-Coding-Standards-document.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://weblogs.asp.net/lhunt/pages/CSharp-Coding-Standards-document.aspx</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>Have you read Code Complete? He does a full treatise on this in the book. Definitely the best naming strategy I've seen in print... And it's easy to find like 1000 programmers at the drop of a hat who name this one of the top 5 resources for programmers and program design.</p>

<p>Just my $.05</p>
<br /><b>#10</b><br /><p>Can I make a shameless plug for the "Names" chapter in my book, "A Sane Approach to Database Design" ? I'm specifically talking about names for things in databases, but most of the same considerations apply to variables in programs.</p>
<br /><b>#11</b><br /><p>It's not clear if your question relates to Python naming conventions.</p>

<p>If so, for starters I would try to follow just these simple rules:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>ClassName</code> - upper case for class names</li>
<li><code>variable_name</code> - lower case and underscore for variables (I try to keep them at two words <em>maximum</em>)</li>
</ul>
