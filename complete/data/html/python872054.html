<h3>Question (ID-872054):</h3><h2>Python vs. C# Twitter API libraries</h2><p>I have experience with both .NET(5yrs) and Python(1yr) and I want to create a simple web project with Twitter as the backbone. I have experience with AppEngine, and have always wanted to try Azure. I'm going to make extensive use of sending and parsing tweets from lots of users at a time, and since I've set a short deadline for this I'd like to take the shortest path possible. So does anyone have any experience with both of these, or have any advice?</p>

<p>A quick look at the twitter API libraries(<a href="http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Libraries" rel="nofollow">http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Libraries</a>) gave me this for python:</p>

<ul>
<li>python-twitter by DeWitt Clinton. This library provides a pure Python interface for the Twitter API.</li>
<li>python-twyt by Andrew Price. BSD licensed Twitter API interface library and command line client.</li>
<li>twitty-twister by Dustin Sallings. A Twisted interface to Twitter.</li>
</ul>

<p>and this for C#:</p>

<ul>
<li>Yedda Twitter Library by Yedda. Every Twitter API method has an equivalent .NET method in this wrapper library.</li>
<li>TwitterooCore API by Eric Willis/RareEdge Design Group. Binary .NET library that can be used in any .NET project. </li>
<li>Twitterizer originally by DigitallyBorn, but now open source. Written for .NET 2.0.</li>
<li>tweet# by Daniel Crenna. "100% coverage of the REST and Search APIs".</li>
</ul>

<p>Myself and a colleague have recently re-written our Twitter web-app's entire back-end with a C# service, and the decision for us came down to which library best suited the purpose.  A number of the libraries have varying 'features', some are more complete than others: we decided which to select based purely on trying them out, and seeing which were the best-optimised, and made our job easiest.</p>

<p>I would make a recommendation for a C# library, but the playing field changes so very quickly, and we've changed implementations a couple of times, as Twitter has deprecated various aspects of their API, and some have updated more quickly than others.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I would put my vote in for this twitter library; <a href="http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/</a></p>

<p>I've used it in 10+ projects that I can think of and its been very good. I've actually been using the dev version in a number of projects too and found it stable and has many more features.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><a href="http://linqtotwitter.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">LINQ to Twitter</a> is available too, covers the entire Twitter API, and works with VB, C#, and Delphi Prism.</p>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You can use both .NET and Python ... IronPython.  IronPython will work with Yedda. [1]</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I am using <a href="http://mike.verdone.ca/twitter/" rel="nofollow">this python library</a> for one of my project.</p>

<p>It's really easy to use and yet very powerful.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>python-twyt by Andrew Price. BSD licensed Twitter API interface library and command line client.</p>

<p>is my python library of choice. it's fairly straightforward. </p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I have a bit of experience with the Twitter API (I'm Digitallyborn, author of Twitterizer).</p>

<p>I would say go with what is easiest to you. There are a lot of great libraries out there for every language.</p>
