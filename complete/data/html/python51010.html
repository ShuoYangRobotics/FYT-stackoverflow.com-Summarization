<h3>Question (ID-51010):</h3><h2>What is the simplest way to find the difference between 2 times in python?</h2><p>I have 2 time values which have the type datetime.time. I want to find their difference. The obvious thing to do is t1 - t2, but this doesn't work. It works for objects of type datetime.datetime but not for datetime.time. So what is the best way to do this?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Also a little silly, but you could try picking an arbitrary day and embedding each time in it, using <code>datetime.datetime.combine</code>, then subtracting:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import datetime
&gt;&gt;&gt; t1 = datetime.time(2,3,4)
&gt;&gt;&gt; t2 = datetime.time(18,20,59)
&gt;&gt;&gt; dummydate = datetime.date(2000,1,1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; datetime.datetime.combine(dummydate,t2) - datetime.datetime.combine(dummydate,t1)
datetime.timedelta(0, 58675)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Python has pytz (<a href="http://pytz.sourceforge.net" rel="nofollow">http://pytz.sourceforge.net</a>) module which can be used for arithmetic of 'time' objects. It takes care of DST offsets as well. The above page has a number of examples that illustrate the usage of pytz.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You could transform both into <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/datetime-timedelta.html" rel="nofollow">timedelta objects</a> and subtract these from each other, taking care to handle carry-overs correctly (from sec to min etc).</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>It seems that this isn't supported, since there wouldn't be a good way to deal with overflows in datetime.time.  I know this isn't an answer directly, but maybe someone with more python experience than me can take this a little further.  For more info, see this: <a href="http://bugs.python.org/issue3250" rel="nofollow">http://bugs.python.org/issue3250</a></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Firstly, note that a datetime.time is a time of day, independent of a given day, and so the different between any two datetime.time values is going to be less than 24 hours.</p>

<p>One approach is to convert both datetime.time values into comparable values (such as milliseconds), and find the difference.</p>

<pre><code>t1, t2 = datetime.time(...), datetime.time(...)

t1_ms = (t1.hour*60*60 + t1.minute*60 + t1.second)*1000 + t1.microsecond
t2_ms = (t2.hour*60*60 + t2.minute*60 + t2.second)*1000 + t2.microsecond

delta_ms = max([t1_ms, t2_ms]) - min([t1_ms, t2_ms])
</code></pre>

<p>It's a little lame, but it works.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Retrieve the times in milliseconds and then do the subtraction.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Environment.TickCount seems to work well if you need something quick.</p>

<p>int start = Environment.TickCount</p>

<p>...DoSomething()</p>

<p>int elapsedtime = Environment.TickCount - start</p>
