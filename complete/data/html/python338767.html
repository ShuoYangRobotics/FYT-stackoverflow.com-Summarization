<h3>Question (ID-338767):</h3><h2>Tool to convert python indentation from spaces to tabs?</h2><p>I have a some .py files that use spaces for indentation, and I'd like to convert them to tabs.</p>

<p>I could easily hack together something using regexes, but I can think of several edge cases where this approach could fail.  Is there a tool that does this by parsing the file and determining the indentation level the same way the python interpreter does?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Since PEP-8 suggests that spaces a preferred over tabs, I'm curious why you're going from preferred (spaces) to not-preferred (tabs).</p>

<p>Wouldn't it be simpler to follow PEP-8 and leave them spaces?</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>If there are not many files to convert, you can open them in <a href="http://www.vim.org/" rel="nofollow">vim</a>, and use the <code>:retab</code> command.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://www.vim.org/htmldoc/usr_30.html#30.5" rel="nofollow">the vim documentation</a> for more information.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Python includes a script for the opposite (tabs to spaces).  It's <code>C:\Python24\Tools\Scripts\reindent.py</code> for me</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>:retab will swap tab with spaces, and :retab! will swap spaces with tab. 1 tab = 4 spaces, 4 spaces = 1 tab, depending on your tab setting.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>In emacs, <code>M-x tabify</code> will convert spaces to tabs where possible. You'll probably want to set the <code>tab-width</code> variable appropriately.</p>

<p>I don't know if this addresses your concern that spaces be interpreted in the same way as the python interpreter, but you could always load up python-mode and use <code>M-x indent-region</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>If you use Linux, you might also play around with <a href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/karmic/en/man1/unexpand.1.html" rel="nofollow">unexpand</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Convert  blanks  in each FILE to tabs,
  writing to standard output.  With no
  FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard
  input.</p>
