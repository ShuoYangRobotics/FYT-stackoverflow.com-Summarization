<h3>Question (ID-3955903):</h3><h2>What PEP 8 guidelines do you ignore, and which ones do you stick to?</h2><p>The title says most of it really :)
Over the years, the more Python I write, the more I find myself agreeing with most of the guidelines, some though I consistently and intentionally break for my own reasons.</p>

<p>I'd be curious to know what in PEP 8 (or other PEPs too maybe) people religiously stick to and why, and what people find inconvenient or inadequate.</p>

<p>In my case (and at work in general), there's only a handful of things we deviate from:
Underscore separated lowercase names, I can see the point of it, as it will unfailingly be consistent, but we tend to use lowerCamelCase, even if it will occasionally introduce some inconsistencies (such as partially or mis-capitalized acronyms and following words, which are often down to spur-of-the-moment calls). Mostly because the near totality of the APIs we routinely use use camelCase (some upper, some lower), and because for some reason I find it easier to read, and tend to reserve underscores as separation tokens or prescribed mangling/obscuring.</p>

<p>I still can't get myself to space things out the way the pep prescribes inside objects. new and init I tend to leave right under the class with no blank lines as I always want to read them right there with the class name and args, methods that contribute to the same scope of functionality in the class (say init, get and set of the same attrib or set of attribs) I only singe space apart, and I like three spaces between classes, and two between methods I wouldn't mentally aggregate in the map of that object.</p>

<p>This is, again, purely for the visual impact and readability of the code. I find that very compact contents inside flow control and this kind of spacing between methods and objects consistently leads my eye exactly where I want it to go on re-readings months after the code had been parked. It also responds well to folding in my editors of choice.</p>

<p>Some things instead I stick to, that drive me nuts when I read otherwise written, is tabs instead of spaces (especially when some in-app editors we use don't really have tab replacement functionalities, contributing considerably to pollution in the code base at prototyping stage).</p>

<p>Order of things such as imports, and what imports, globals etc. It really throws me off on files that have large amounts of imports when those are mixed up or out of order.</p>

<p>Whitespaces in statements, especially when people use tabs AND try to align assignment ops across lines with different length in var names (and there seems to be no way to persuade those who do it that an excel looking piece of code is NOT neater ;) ).</p>

<p>And spacing within a control block, particularly when I see apparently random spacing within the same flow control block, and then similar amounts of spacing used within the object for methods. I'm compelled to edit those before I can even start reading the damn thing.</p>

<p>So, those are mine, and the reasoning behind my "violations" of the PEP (some shared, some frowned upon by colleagues). I'd be very curious to read what other Pythonistas do and don't do in those regards.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-9):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I don't agree with this:</p>

<pre><code>- Imports should usually be on separate lines, e.g.:

    Yes: import os
         import sys

    No:  import sys, os
</code></pre>

<p>I always write simple imports together.  I don't see any advantage to writing them all on separate lines: all it does is add bloat to the top of each source file, and turn something concise and easy to type into something that's borderline <em>boilerplate</em>, eg. something that's so verbose it starts to be tempting to copy and paste from other files.</p>

<p>This is instantly readable and understandable:</p>

<pre><code>import sys, os, time, gc, inspect, math, doctest
</code></pre>

<p>It's short, easy to skim, and easy to add to.  I do use multiple <code>import</code> statements if there are too many on one line, of course, or if I need a <code>from</code> import.</p>

<p>I also <em>do</em> generally keep standard library imports separate from imports of my own modules and other libraries, which agrees with the concept of grouping PEP8 recommends.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The "79 characters per line" part is nonsense.  Their very own example shows how unreadable code becomes when doing this:</p>

<pre><code>class Rectangle(Blob):

    def __init__(self, width, height,
                 color='black', emphasis=None, highlight=0):
        if width == 0 and height == 0 and \
           color == 'red' and emphasis == 'strong' or \
           highlight &gt; 100:
            raise ValueError("sorry, you lose")
        if width == 0 and height == 0 and (color == 'red' or
                                           emphasis is None):
            raise ValueError("I don't think so -- values are %s, %s" %
                             (width, height))
        Blob.__init__(self, width, height,
                      color, emphasis, highlight)
</code></pre>

<p>It's like try-<br>ing to read<br>a news arti-<br>cle written<br> like this.</p>

<p>80-column terminals havn't been a serious development environment for over a decade.  When I do need to edit from a crippled 80x25 environment in a pinch, editor wrapping is a minor inconvenience; I'm not going to maim my code during normal development just to avoid that.</p>

<p>120 column wrapping is perfectly sensible for modern development, and I have no problem with 140.  This guideline is obsolete and following it results in ugly, hard-to-read code.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Standards are critical and PEP 8 is a very good style guide that I insist on. The only guideline I disagree with is the spacing around mathematical operators. For example PEP8 insists on the following spacings</p>

<pre><code>Without PEP8                           With PEP8                
---------------------------------------------------------------- 
y = sqrt(x**2 + y**2)                  y = sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2) 
a*x**3 + b*x**2 + c*x + d              a * x ** 3 + b * x ** 2 + c * x + d 
10**(a*x + b)                          10 ** (a * x + b)  
F = V/(sqrt(g*h) + epsilon)            F = V / (sqrt(g * h) + epsilon) 
a*cos(nx/pi) + b*sin(nx/pi)            a * cos(nx / pi) + b * sin(nx / pi) 
</code></pre>

<p>I am trying to conform, but this is the one area where I am struggling.
Do anyone else also feel that PEP8 spacing makes mathematics harder to read?</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I always use 4 spaces, I try to use maximum of 79 chars per line, not possible sometime.
I also used imports like "import sys, os" in the past.
In general I try to stick to pop 8.</p>

<p>Edit: also use:</p>

<pre><code>def foobar():
    """
    foobar
    """
</code></pre>

<p>for documentation</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Multi-line conditionals etc.: PEP-8 explicitly says to break <em>after</em> a binary operator instead of before it. I'm afraid that I cannot see the appeal of that. It makes a lot more sense to me to break before the conditional, so that in wrapped/continued lines, each sub-line begins with the conditional:</p>

<pre><code>if (condition1 \
        or condition2 \
        or condition3):
    do_something()
</code></pre>

<p>As can be seen, I also like to add an extra indent for the sublines, so that they are visually offset from the block below. PEP-8 does not say anything explicit about this (does it?), but the examples have the sub-lines lining up with the opening parentheses.  </p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>When I'm writing tiny scripts I often just just use two spaces.</p>

<p>I always the same pattern for docstrings:</p>

<pre><code>def function():
    """
    Even if it's a single line.
    """
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I use pylint,  <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pylint" rel="nofollow">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pylint</a>, it is an excellent tool to try to keep your code clean and readable for you and other developers accessing your code.</p>

<p>I does not cover all topics you said, though, but it is very useful.</p>

<p>You can have reports like this one:</p>
