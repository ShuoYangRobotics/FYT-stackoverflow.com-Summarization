<h3>Question (ID-2276000):</h3><h2>Program web applications in python without a framework?</h2><p>I am just starting Python and I was wondering how I would go about programming web applications without the need of a framework. I am an experiance PHP developer but I have an urge to try out Python and I usually like to write from scratch without the restriction of a framework.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.wsgi.org/wsgi/" rel="nofollow">WSGI</a> is the Python standard for web server interfaces.  If you want to create your own framework or operate without a framework, you should look into that.  Specifically I have found <a href="http://pythonpaste.org/do-it-yourself-framework.html" rel="nofollow">Ian Bicking's DIY Framework</a> article helpful.</p>

<p>As an aside, I tend to think frameworks are useful and personally use Django, like the way Pylons works, and have used <a href="http://bottle.paws.de/" rel="nofollow">Bottle</a> in the past for prototyping--you may want to look at Bottle if you want a stay-out-of-your-way microframework.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>One of the lightest-weight frameworks is <code>mod_wsgi</code>.  Anything less is going to be a huge amount of work parsing HTTP requests to find headers and URI's and methods and parsing the GET or POST query/data association, handling file uploads, cookies, etc.</p>

<p>As it is, mod_wsgi will only handle the basics of request parsing and framing up results.</p>

<p>Sessions, cookies, using a template generator for your response pages will be a surprising amount of work.</p>

<p>Once you've started down that road, you may find that a little framework support goes a long way.  </p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You will have to look into something like CGI or <a href="http://cleverdevil.org/computing/24/python-fastcgi-wsgi-and-lighttpd" rel="nofollow">FastCGI</a>, which provides an API to communicate to the webserver.</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/intl/nl-NL/appengine/" rel="nofollow">Google App Engine</a> enables you to write simple apps, and even provides a local webserver where you can try things out.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You should try web.py, it provides a bare minimum of features that does not get in your way.</p>

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>For a PHP programmer, I think <a href="http://www.modpython.org/" rel="nofollow">mod_python</a> is a good way to get started without any framework. It can be used directly as Apache 2 module. You can have code tags (like <code>&lt;? ?&gt;</code> in PHP) and even conditional HTML output (HTML inside if statement):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%
if x == y:
   # begin
%&gt;

  ... some html ...

&lt;%
# end
%&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>(simplified example taken from <em>onlamp.com</em>'s <a href="http://onlamp.com/pub/a/python/2004/02/26/python_server_pages.html" rel="nofollow">Python Server Pages tutorial</a>)</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>The answer is "don't". Using a framework makes your code more maintainable, scalable, readable, testable, and modular.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>People here love frameworks.  One shortcoming I have noted is that Python lacks a handy-dandy module for Sessions as a library built-in, despite it being available in PHP and as CGI::Session in Perl.</p>

<p>You will end up doing:</p>

<pre><code>import cgi  # if you want to work with forms and such
import cgitb; cgitb.enable()  # to barf up errors to the web
print 'Content-type: text/html\n\n'  # to start off any HTML.
</code></pre>

<p>You will have to write session stuff on your own.</p>
