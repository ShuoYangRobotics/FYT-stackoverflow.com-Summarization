<h3>Question (ID-6523791):</h3><h2>Why is Python running my module when I import it, and how do I stop it?</h2><p>I have a Python program I'm building that can be run in either of 2 ways: the first is to call "python main.py" which prompts the user for input in a friendly manner and then runs the user input through the program.  The other way is to call "python batch.py <em>-file-</em>" which will pass over all the friendly input gathering and run an entire file's worth of input through the program in a single go.</p>

<p>The problem is that when I run "batch.py" it imports some variables/methods/etc from "main.py", and when it runs this code:</p>

<pre><code>import main
</code></pre>

<p>at the first line of the program, it immediately errors because it tries to run the code in "main.py".</p>

<p>How can I stop Python from running the code contained in the "main" module which I'm importing?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Because this is just how Python works -- <code>class</code>, <code>def</code>, etc are <em>not declarations</em>. Instead, they are <em>real live statements</em> which are executed. If they were not executed your module would be ... empty :-)</p>

<p>Anyway, the idiomatic approach is:</p>

<pre><code># stuff to run always here such as class/def
def main():
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
   # stuff only to run when not called via 'import' here
   main()
</code></pre>

<p>See <a href="http://effbot.org/pyfaq/tutor-what-is-if-name-main-for.htm" rel="nofollow">What is <code>if __name__ == "__main__"</code> for?</a></p>

<p>It does require source control over the module being <code>import</code>ed, however.</p>

<p>Happy coding</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Unfortunately, you don't. That is part of how the import syntax works and it is important that it does so -- remember <code>def</code> is actually something executed, if Python did not execute the import, you'd be, well, stuck without functions.</p>

<p>Since you probably have access to the file, though, you might be able to look and see what causes the error. It might be possible to modify your environment to prevent the error from happening.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Use the <code>if __name__ == '__main__'</code> idiom -- <code>__name__</code> is a special variable whose value is <code>'__main__'</code> if the module is being run as a script, and the module name if it's imported. So you'd do something like</p>

<pre><code># imports
# class/function definitions
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # code here will only run when you invoke 'python main.py'
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Due to the way Python works, it is necessary for it to run your modules when it imports them.</p>

<p>To prevent code in the module from being executed when imported, but only when run directly, you can guard it with this <code>if</code>:</p>

<pre><code>if __name__ == "__main__":
    # this won't be run when imported
</code></pre>

<p>You may want to put this code in a <code>main()</code> method, so that you can either execute the file directly, or import the module and call the <code>main()</code>. For example, assume this is in the file <code>foo.py</code>.</p>

<pre><code>def main():
    print "Hello World"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
</code></pre>

<p>This program can be run either by going <code>python foo.py</code>, or from another Python script:</p>

<pre><code>import foo

...

foo.main()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You may write your "main.py" like this:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python

__all__=["somevar", "do_something"]

somevar=""

def do_something():
    pass #blahblah

if __name__=="__main__":
    do_something()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Try just importing the functions needed from main.py? So,</p>

<pre><code>from main import SomeFunction
</code></pre>

<p>It could be that you've named a function in batch.py the same as one in main.py, and when you import main.py the program runs the main.py function instead of the batch.py function; doing the above should fix that. I hope.</p>
