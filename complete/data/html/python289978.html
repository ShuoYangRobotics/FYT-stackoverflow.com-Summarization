<h3>Question (ID-289978):</h3><h2>What's the simplest way to access mssql with python or ironpython?</h2><p>I've got mssql 2005 running on my personal computer with a database I'd like to run some python scripts on. I'm looking for a way to do some really simple access on the data. I'd like to run some select statements, process the data and maybe have python save a text file with the results.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, even though I know a bit about python and a bit about databases, it's very difficult for me to tell, just from reading, if a library does what I want. Ideally, I'd like something that works for other versions of mssql, is free of charge and licensed to allow commercial use, is simple to use, and possibly works with ironpython.</p>

<pre><code>import clr
clr.AddReference('System.Data')
from System.Data.SqlClient import SqlConnection, SqlParameter

conn_string = 'data source=&lt;machine&gt;; initial catalog=&lt;database&gt;; trusted_connection=True'
connection = SqlConnection(conn_string)
connection.Open()
command = connection.CreateCommand()
command.CommandText = 'select id, name from people where group_id = @group_id'
command.Parameters.Add(SqlParameter('group_id', 23))

reader = command.ExecuteReader()
while reader.Read():
    print reader['id'], reader['name']

connection.Close()
</code></pre>

<p>If you've already got IronPython, you don't need to install anything else.</p>

<p>Lots of docs available <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.sqlclient.sqlconnection.aspx" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.ironpython.info/index.php/Contents#Databases" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I use <a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/" rel="nofollow">SQL Alchemy</a> with cPython (I don't know if it'll work with IronPython though).  It'll be pretty familiar to you if you've used Hibernate/nHibernate.  If that's a bit too verbose for you, you can use <a href="http://elixir.ematia.de/trac/wiki" rel="nofollow">Elixir</a>, which is a thin layer on top of SQL Alchemy.  To use either one of those, you'll need <a href="http://pyodbc.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">pyodbc</a>, but that's a pretty simple install.</p>

<p>Of course, if you want to write straight SQL and not use an ORM, you just need pyodbc.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>pyodbc comes with Activestate Python, which can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.activestate.com/store/productdetail.aspx?prdGuid=b08b04e0-6872-4d9d-a722-7a0c2dea2758" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  A minimal odbc script to connect to a SQL Server 2005 database looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>import odbc

CONNECTION_STRING="""\
Driver={SQL Native Client};
Server=[Insert Server Name Here];
Database=[Insert DB Here];
Trusted_Connection=yes;
"""

db = odbc.odbc(CONNECTION_STRING)
c = db.cursor()
c.execute ('select foo from bar')
rs = c.fetchall()
for r in rs:
    print r[0]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p><a href="http://adodbapi.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">http://adodbapi.sourceforge.net/</a> can be used with either CPython or IronPython. I have been very pleased with it.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I also successfully use <a href="http://pymssql.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">pymssql</a> with CPython. (With and without SQLAlchemy).</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I've used <a href="http://pymssql.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">pymssql</a> with standard python and liked it. Probably easier than the alternatives mentioned if you're <em>just</em> looking for basic database access.</p>

<p>Sample <a href="http://pymssql.sourceforge.net/example_pymssql.html" rel="nofollow">code</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>If you are want the quick and dirty way with CPython (also works for 3.X python):</p>

<p>Install PYWIN32 after you install python <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/" rel="nofollow">http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/</a></p>

<p>Import the following library:
import odbc</p>

<p>I created the following method for getting the SQL Server odbc driver (it is slightly different in naming depending on your version of Windows, so this will get it regardless):</p>

<pre><code>def getSQLServerDriver():
    key = winreg.OpenKey(winreg.HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, r"SOFTWARE\ODBC\ODBCINST.INI")
    sqlServerRegExp =  re.compile('sql.*server', re.I | re.S)

    try:
        for i in range(0, 2048):
            folder = winreg.EnumKey(key, i)
            if sqlServerRegExp.match(folder):
                return folder.strip()
    except WindowsError:
        pass
</code></pre>

<p>Note: if you use the above function, you'll need to also import these two libraries: winreg and re</p>

<p>Then you use the odbc API 1 information as defined here: <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0248/" rel="nofollow">http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0248/</a></p>

<p>Your connection interface string should look something like this (assuming you are using my above method for getting the ODBC driver name, and it is a trusted connection):</p>

<pre><code>dbString = "Driver={SQLDriver};Server=[SQL Server];Database=[Database Name];Trusted_Connection=yes;".replace('{SQLDriver}', '{' + getSQLServerDriver() + '}')
</code></pre>

<p>This method has many down sides.  It is clumsy because of only supporting ODBC API 1, and there are a couple minor bugs in either the API or the ODBC driver that I've run across, but it does get the job done in all versions of CPython in Windows.</p>
