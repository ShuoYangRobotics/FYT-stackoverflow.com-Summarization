<h3>Question (ID-4046166):</h3><h2>Easy to navigate online Python reference manual?</h2><p>I'm looking for some reference pages for Python similar to PHP.net's documentation. i.e., something that provides a clear, simple list of all the classes and methods within a module that I can click to get more information, such as the arguments. Having descriptions below each class/method makes it harder to find what you're looking for.</p>

<hr>

<p>Haven't got the answer I'm looking for, so I'm in the process of creating such an index. <del>Version 1 should be ready in a few hours hopefully.</del> <a href="http://programanddesign.com/pydocs/" rel="nofollow">link</a></p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>First few lines of the built-in docs seem fine to me:</p>

<pre><code>from datetime import time
help(time)
</code></pre>

<p>Prints:</p>

<pre><code>class time(__builtin__.object)
 |  time([hour[, minute[, second[, microsecond[, tzinfo]]]]]) --&gt; a time object
 |
 |  All arguments are optional. tzinfo may be None, or an instance of
 |  a tzinfo subclass. The remaining arguments may be ints or longs.
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import datetime
&gt;&gt;&gt; help(datetime.time)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Personally, I find these two techniques helpful:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Import the module <code>datetime</code> and then doing <code>help(datetime.time)</code>. The output is much better and gives mostly what you need. </p></li>
<li><p>Using <code>effbot's</code> reference. You can check out the datetime one <a href="http://effbot.org/librarybook/datetime.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I usually Google <code>Effbot &lt;module&gt;</code> for a short description of the module and a working example. Very helpful in times. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>More specifically, <a href="http://effbot.org/librarybook/" rel="nofollow">this</a> is what I am talking about.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The standard online reference manual <a href="http://docs.python.org/search.html?q=datetime&amp;check_keywords=yes&amp;area=default" rel="nofollow">has a search function</a> that works reasonably well.</p>

<p>The search for <code>datetime</code> linked to above provides a list that includes the contents of the datetime module, methods/properties on the datetime class, several references to datetime from elsewhere in the library, and a bunch of C API references.</p>

<p>Looking in a <strong>reference manual</strong> presupposes to some extent that you know what you are looking for.</p>

<p>It sounds like maybe you want a list of methods/properties for the class to be displayed in the left-hand nav? If so, it might be worth putting in a request for this to the docs folks to see if it something that could be changed.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You could try</p>

<pre><code>python -m pydoc -p 8000
</code></pre>

<p>then go to <code>http://localhost:8000</code></p>

<p>Probably still not what you're looking for, but it's another option.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Perhaps someone should simply use iframes (or actual frames) to put these together:</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.python.org/library" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/library</a>
./reference</p>

<p>Maybe take you an hour with BeautifulSoup, re, and urllib2.</p>

<p>I've found Ctrl-f applied to ./library works ok.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Easy-to-navigate python reference manual:</p>

<p>Go to the obvious(?) place -- Python Library manual, datetime module: <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/datetime.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/library/datetime.html</a></p>

<p>In the table of contents in the panel on the left, notice "8.1.5 time Objects". Click on the link.</p>

<p>Read the top of the page:</p>

<p>class datetime.time(hour[, minute[, second[, microsecond[, tzinfo]]]])</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> OK, so we want "utcoffset" and it's not at the top of the page. Try this in your browser: <code>&lt;Ctrl-F&gt;</code>, type "utcoffset" (without the quotes), <code>&lt;Enter&gt;</code></p>

<p>Alternative: (may be available only on Windows and Linux) -- a CHM version of the docs is included with Windows Python distributions and I've heard that it can be used on Linux as well. Start it up, click on Index, type "utcoffset" (without the quotes), <code>&lt;Enter&gt;</code> and it'll display three options -- it's a method of datetime.(datetime|time|tzinfo)</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>@Mark - for some reason I can't post comments.</p>

<p>I completely agree with you. Been coding in PHP for years, and their documentation is the best I've found - Java's is in a similar vein but a little more complicated to view.</p>

<p>I want to see the same as you - a scannable list of functions and methods, arguments plus types, defaults and whether they're optional and return types.</p>

<p>It's not rocket science. I honestly don't know how people do anything quickly in Python until they know it inside out. It's ridiculous that I have to Google instead of using the language's own documentation system. </p>

<p>The whole set-up of the python docs is targetted at people who already know what they're looking for, whether that's the Python docs web site, or pydoc itself. And forget about opening a python shell every time I want to do something and using 'help'. Seriously? Use CTRL-F on the page? I don't know specifically what I'm looking for.</p>

<p>If I knew which class a method was part, or the specific name of the method or function I'm looking for the docs could be almost usable, although still slow and waffly. But when I don't know whether I'm looking for <code>join</code> or <code>implode</code> or whatever, it is pretty much useless.</p>

<p>A case in point - I'm trying to find out <em>quickly</em> how to work with and raise an OSError. The docs laboriously mention in a textual description that there is an <code>errno</code> attribute. Where's the constructor documented? Not on <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/exceptions.html#exceptions.OSError" rel="nofollow">the exceptions page</a>. Not linked to. No idea what arguments it takes. Can't find out easily the methods on it or attributes. I should see bullet points and relevant code in an easily scannable list. What a waste of time. Shame since I like the language.</p>

<p>PS - so my answer is for someone to create python docs in the style of PHP.</p>

<p>==== UPDATE ====</p>

<p>This is exactly what I was looking for: <a href="http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/stdlib/" rel="nofollow">Epydoc</a>. WTF did it take me 2 days of Googling to find it?</p>
