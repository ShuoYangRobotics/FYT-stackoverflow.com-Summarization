<h3>Question (ID-2500358):</h3><h2>Bash or python for changing spacing in files</h2><p>I have a set of 10000 files. In all of them, the second line, looks like:</p>

<pre><code>AAA 3.429 3.84
</code></pre>

<p>so there is just one space (requirement) between AAA and the two other columns. The rest of lines on each file are completely different and correspond to 10 columns of numbers.</p>

<p>Randomly, in around 20% of the files, and due to some errors, one gets</p>

<pre><code>BBB  3.429 3.84
</code></pre>

<p>so now there are two spaces between the first and second column.</p>

<p>This is a big error so I need to fix it, changing from 2 to 1 space in the files where the error takes place.</p>

<p>The first approach I thought of was to write a bash script that for each file reads the 3 values of the second line and then prints them with just one space, doing it for all the files.</p>

<p>I wonder what do oyu think about this approach and if you could suggest something better, bashm python or someother approach.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-9):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Performing line-based changes to text files is often simplest to do in <code>sed</code>.</p>

<pre><code>sed -e '2s/  */ /g' infile.txt
</code></pre>

<p>will replace any runs of multiple spaces with a single space.  This may be changing more than you want, though.</p>

<pre><code>sed -e '2s/^\([^ ]*\)  /\1 /' infile.txt
</code></pre>

<p>should just replace instances of two spaces after the first block of space-free text with a single space (though I have not tested this).</p>

<p>(<em>edit:</em> inserted <code>2</code> before <code>s</code> in each instance to tie the edit to the second line, specifically.)</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Use sed.</p>

<pre><code>for file in *
do
  sed -i '' '2s/  / /' "$file"
done
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>-i ''</code> flag means to edit in-place without a backup.</p>

<p>Or use ed!</p>

<pre><code>for file in *
do
  printf "2s/  / /\nwq\n" |ed -s "$file"
done
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>if the error always can occur at 2nd line, </p>

<pre><code>for file in file*
do
    awk 'NR==2{$1=$1}1' file &gt;temp
    mv temp "$file"    
done
</code></pre>

<p>or sed</p>

<pre><code>sed -i.bak '2s/  */ /' file* # do 2nd line
</code></pre>

<p>Or just pure bash scripting</p>

<pre><code>i=1
while read -r line
do
  if [ "$i" -eq 2 ];then
    echo $line
  else
    echo "$line"
  fi
  ((i++))
done &lt;"file"
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I am going to be different and go with AWK:</p>

<pre><code>awk '{print $1,$2,$3}' file.txt &gt; file1.txt
</code></pre>

<p>This will handle any number of spaces between fields, and replace them with one space</p>

<p>To handle a specific line you can add line addresses:</p>

<pre><code>awk 'NR==2{print $1,$2,$3} NR!=2{print $0}' file.txt &gt; file1.txt
</code></pre>

<p>i.e. rewrite line 2, but leave unchanged the other lines.</p>

<p>A line address can be a regular expression as well:</p>

<pre><code>awk '/regexp/{print $1,$2,$3} !/regexp/{print}' file.txt &gt; file1.txt
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Since it seems every column is separated by one space, another approach not yet mentioned is to use tr to squeeze all multi spaces into single spaces:
<br>
tr -s " " &lt; infile > outfile</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I don't quite understand, but yes, <code>sed</code> is an option. I don't think any POSIX compliant version of <code>sed</code> has an in file option (-i), so a fully POSIX compliant solution would be.</p>

<pre><code>sed -e 's/^BBB  /BBB /' &lt;file&gt; &gt; &lt;newfile&gt;
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>This answer assumes you don't want to mess with any except the second line.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys, os
for fname in sys.argv[1:]:
    with open(fname, "r") as fin:
        line1 = fin.readline()
        line2 = fin.readline()
        fixedLine2 = " ".join(line2.split()) + '\n'
        if fixedLine2 == line2:
            continue
        with open(fname + ".fixed", "w") as fout:
            fout.write(line1)
            fout.write(line2)
            for line in fin:
                fout.write(line)
    # Enable these lines if you want the old files replaced with the new ones.
    #os.remove(fname)
    #os.rename(fname + ".fixed", fname)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Use sed:</p>

<pre><code>sed -e 's/[[:space:]][[:space:]]/ /g' yourfile.txt &gt;&gt; newfile.txt
</code></pre>

<p>This will replace any two adjacent spaces with one. The use of [[:space:]] just makes it a little bit clearer</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><pre><code>sed -i -e '2s/  / /g' input.txt
</code></pre>

<p>-i: edit files in place</p>
