<h3>Question (ID-7869589):</h3><h2>Which Python user interface library can I use for 2D games?</h2><p>I want to create a 2D game on Python with heavy user interface: windows, buttons, text input, etc. So far I've been using PyGame for a few simple games.</p>

<p>The game is a 2D MUD, with the standard rendering loop to draw stuff on the screen. I need the user interface to interact with the game entities like sales, blacksmith, etc.</p>

<p>I am looking for something like a mix of Pygame and wxPython/pyQT/pyGTK.</p>

<p>Which libraries can I use?</p>

Sadly there isnÂ´t a <a href="http://clanlib.org/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Clanlib</a> python binding like for <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/clanperl/" rel="nofollow">perl</a> and <a href="http://clanruby.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">ruby</a>. That would be, probably, the ideal choice.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You can use the popular <a href="http://www.pyglet.org" rel="nofollow">Pyglet</a> game library along with <a href="http://www.wxpython.org" rel="nofollow">wxPython</a>, the cross platform GUI library. An example of how to do this:</p>

<p><a href="http://pyglet.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/experimental/wxtest.py" rel="nofollow">http://pyglet.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/experimental/wxtest.py</a></p>

<p>Additionally, if you want to use pure Pyglet, you can use <a href="http://code.google.com/p/kytten/" rel="nofollow">Kytten</a>, a pure Python GUI library built on the top of Pyglet.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Not sure if it fits your use, but <a href="http://pygame.org/project/108/" rel="nofollow">PGU</a> is fit for pygame because it lets you use your own render loop, and tie into it.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/librpg/" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/librpg/</a> maybe what you need</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>tkinter is one choice. It has a canvas widget that is very easy to use -- you can draw objects (lines, circles, etc) as well as embed images (for tiles, for example). And of course it comes with a standard collection of widgets (buttons, comboboxes, listboxes, menus, etc) that can either be embedded in a canvas or used in the more traditional sense. </p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Take a look at <a href="http://librocket.com/" rel="nofollow">librocket</a>. It supports python scripting as well..</p>
