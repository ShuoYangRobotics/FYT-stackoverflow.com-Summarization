<h3>Question (ID-5316284):</h3><h2>Python: run one function until another function finishes</h2><p>I have two functions, <code>draw_ascii_spinner</code> and <code>findCluster(companyid)</code>.</p>

<p>I would like to: </p>

<ol>
<li>Run <code>findCluster(companyid)</code> in the backround and while its processing....  </li>
<li>Run <code>draw_ascii_spinner</code> until <code>findCluster(companyid)</code> finishes</li>
</ol>

<p>How do I begin to try to solve for this (Python 2.7)?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You can use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html" rel="nofollow">multiprocessing</a>. Or, if <code>findCluster(companyid)</code> has sensible stopping points, you can turn it into a generator along with <code>draw_ascii_spinner</code>, to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>for tick in findCluster(companyid):
    ascii_spinner.next()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Use threads:</p>

<pre><code>import threading, time

def wrapper(func, args, res):
    res.append(func(*args))

res = []
t = threading.Thread(target=wrapper, args=(findcluster, (companyid,), res))
t.start()
while t.is_alive():
    # print next iteration of ASCII spinner
    t.join(0.2)
print res[0]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>This can be done with threads. FindCluster runs in a separate thread and when done, it can simply signal another thread that is polling for a reply.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You'll want to do some research on threading, the general form is going to be this</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a new thread for findCluster and create some way for the program to know the method is running - simplest in Python is just a global boolean</li>
<li>Run draw_ascii_spinner in a while loop conditioned on whether it is still running, you'll probably want to have this thread sleep for a short period of time between iterations</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's a short tutorial in Python -  <a href="http://linuxgazette.net/107/pai.html" rel="nofollow">http://linuxgazette.net/107/pai.html</a></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Generally, you will use Threads. Here is a simplistic approach which assumes, that there are only two threads: 1) the main thread executing a <code>task</code>, 2) the spinner thread:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python

import time
import thread

def spinner():
    while True:
        print '.'
        time.sleep(1)

def task():
    time.sleep(5)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    thread.start_new_thread(spinner, ())
    # as soon as task finishes (and so the program)
    # spinner will be gone as well
    task()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Run <code>findCluster()</code> in a thread (the Threading module makes this very easy), and then <code>draw_ascii_spinner</code> until some condition is met.</p>

<p>Instead of using <code>sleep()</code> to set the pace of the spinner, you can wait on the thread's <code>wait()</code> with a timeout.</p>
