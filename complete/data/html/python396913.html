<h3>Question (ID-396913):</h3><h2>In Python, how do I find the date of the first Monday of a given week?</h2><p>If I have a certain week number (eg 51) and a given year (eg 2008), how do I find the date of the first Monday of that same week?</p>

<p>Many thanks</p>

&gt;&gt;&gt; time.asctime(time.strptime('2008 50 1', '%Y %W %w'))
'Mon Dec 15 00:00:00 2008'

<p>Assuming the first day of your week is Monday, use <code>%U</code> instead of <code>%W</code> if the first day of your week is Sunday.  See the documentation for <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/time.html#time.strptime" rel="nofollow">strptime</a> for details.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Fixed week number.  The <code>%W</code> directive is 0-based so week 51 would be entered as 50, not 51.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Week 51 of 2008 started with Monday December 15:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; d = date(2008, 1, 1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; d + timedelta(days=-d.weekday(), weeks=50)
datetime.date(2008, 12, 15)
</code></pre>

<p>Week 1 of 2009 started on December 29:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; d = date(2009, 1, 1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; d + timedelta(days=-d.weekday(), weeks=0)
datetime.date(2008, 12, 29)
</code></pre>

<p>Found a <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/custom.html?year=2008&amp;country=21&amp;wno=1&amp;moon=on&amp;hol=25" rel="nofollow">web calendar that shows week numbers</a>. And then there's always <a href="http://vecka.nu" rel="nofollow">vecka.nu</a> (Vecka means week in Swedish, nu means now.)</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>PEZ's and Gerald Kaszuba's solutions work under assumption that January 1st will always be in the first week of a given year. This assumption is not correct for ISO calendar, see <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/datetime.html#datetime.date.isocalendar" rel="nofollow">Python's docs</a> for reference. For example, in ISO calendar, week 1 of 2010 actually starts on Jan 4, and Jan 1 of 2010 is in week 53 of 2009. An ISO calendar-compatible solution:</p>

<pre><code>from datetime import date, timedelta

def week_start_date(year, week):
    d = date(year, 1, 1)    
    delta_days = d.isoweekday() - 1
    delta_weeks = week
    if year == d.isocalendar()[0]:
        delta_weeks -= 1
    delta = timedelta(days=-delta_days, weeks=delta_weeks)
    return d + delta
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>This seems to work, assuming week one can have a Monday falling on a day in the last year.    </p>

<pre><code>from datetime import date, timedelta

def get_first_dow(year, week):
    d = date(year, 1, 1)
    d = d - timedelta(d.weekday())
    dlt = timedelta(days = (week - 1) * 7)
    return d + dlt
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Anybody interested in these sorts of questions should check out the smash-hit bestseller <a href="http://emr.cs.iit.edu/home/reingold/calendar-book/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">Calendrical Calculations</a> by Reingold and Dershowitz.  Before there were books there was a journal paper, which is the <strong>most requested reprint in the history of <em>Software---Practice &amp; Experience</em></strong>.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><pre><code>from datetime import date, timedelta

def first_monday(year, week):
    d = date(year, 1, 4)  # The Jan 4th must be in week 1  according to ISO
    return d + timedelta(weeks=(week-1), days=-d.weekday())
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I have slightly modified the script of Vaidas K. in a way that it will return the beginning of the week and the end day of the week.</p>

<pre><code>from datetime import datetime, date, timedelta

def weekbegend(year, week):
    """
    Calcul du premier et du dernier jour de la semaine ISO
    """
    d = date(year, 1, 1)    
    delta_days = d.isoweekday() - 1
    delta_weeks = week
    if year == d.isocalendar()[0]:
        delta_weeks -= 1
    # delta for the beginning of the week
    delta = timedelta(days=-delta_days, weeks=delta_weeks)
    weekbeg = d + delta
    # delta2 for the end of the week
    delta2 = timedelta(days=6-delta_days, weeks=delta_weeks)
    weekend = d + delta2
    return weekbeg, weekend
</code></pre>

<p>Soyou can use it that way.</p>

<pre><code>weekbeg, weekend = weekbegend(2009, 1)
begweek = weekbeg.strftime("%A %d %B %Y")
endweek = weekend.strftime("%A %d %B %Y")
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Use the string formatting found in the time module. <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/current/library/time.html#time.strftime" rel="nofollow">Detailed explanation of the formats used</a></p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import time
&gt;&gt;&gt; time.strptime("51 08 1","%U %y %w")
(2008, 12, 22, 0, 0, 0, 0, 357, -1)
</code></pre>

<p>The date returned is off by one week according to the calendar on my computer, maybe that is because weeks are indexed from 0?</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>Look at the documentation <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/time.html" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>

<p>The rest is up to you.</p>
