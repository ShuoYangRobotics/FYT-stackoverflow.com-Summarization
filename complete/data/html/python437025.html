<h3>Question (ID-437025):</h3><h2>How to implement a python REPL that nicely handles asynchronous output?</h2><p>I have a Python-based app that can accept a few commands in a simple read-eval-print-loop. I'm using <code>raw_input('&gt; ')</code> to get the input. On Unix-based systems, I also <code>import readline</code> to make things behave a little better. All this is working fine.</p>

<p>The problem is that there are asynchronous events coming in, and I'd like to print output as soon as they happen. Unfortunately, this makes things look ugly. The "> " string doesn't show up again after the output, and if the user is halfway through typing something, it chops their text in half. It should probably redraw the user's text-in-progress after printing something.</p>

<p>This seems like it must be a solved problem. What's the proper way to do this?</p>

<p>Also note that some of my users are Windows-based.</p>

<p>TIA</p>

<p>Edit: The accepted answer works under Unixy platforms (when the readline module is available), but if anyone knows how to make this work under Windows, it would be much appreciated!</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python2.6

from __future__ import print_function

import readline
import threading

PROMPT = '&gt; '

def interrupt():
    print() # Don't want to end up on the same line the user is typing on.
    print('Interrupting cow -- moo!')
    print(PROMPT, readline.get_line_buffer(), sep='', end='')

def cli():
    while True:
        cli = str(raw_input(PROMPT))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    threading.Thread(target=cli).start()
    threading.Timer(2, interrupt).start()
</code></pre>

<p>I don't think that stdin is thread-safe, so you can end up losing characters to the interrupting thread (that the user will have to retype at the end of the <code>interrupt</code>). I exaggerated the amount of <code>interrupt</code> time with the <code>time.sleep</code> call. The <code>readline.get_line_buffer</code> call won't display the characters that get lost, so it all turns out alright.</p>

<p>Note that stdout itself isn't thread safe, so if you've got multiple interrupting threads of execution, this can still end up looking gross.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Why are you writing your own REPL using <code>raw_input()</code>?  Have you looked at the <code>cmd.Cmd</code> class?  <strong>Edit:</strong> I just found the <a href="http://www.alittletooquiet.net/software/sclapp/" rel="nofollow">sclapp</a> library, which may also be useful.</p>

<p>Note: the <code>cmd.Cmd</code> class (and sclapp) may or may not directly support your original goal; you may have to subclass it and modify it as needed to provide that feature.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>run this:</p>

<pre><code>python -m twisted.conch.stdio
</code></pre>

<p>You'll get a nice, colored, async REPL, <strong>without using threads</strong>. While you type in the prompt, the event loop is running.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>look into the code module, it lets you create objects for interpreting python code also (shameless plug) <a href="https://github.com/iridium172/PyTerm" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/iridium172/PyTerm</a> lets you create interactive command line programs that handle raw keyboard input (like ^C will raise a KeyboardInterrupt).</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>It's kind of a non-answer, but I would look at <a href="http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/" rel="nofollow">IPython</a>'s code to see how they're doing it.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I think you have 2 basic options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Synchronize your output (i.e. block until it comes back)</li>
<li>Separate your input and your (asyncronous) output, perhaps in two separate columns.</li>
</ol>
