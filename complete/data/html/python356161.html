</blockquote>

<p>As mentioned by you follow <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow">PEP 8</a> for the main text, and <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/" rel="nofollow">PEP 257</a> for docstring conventions</p>

<p>Along with Python Style Guides, I suggest that you refer the following:</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I follow these <a href="http://jaynes.colorado.edu/PythonGuidelines.html" rel="nofollow">guidelines</a>. I think they are exactly the same than PEP 8, but are more synthetic and based on examples.</p>

<p>If you are using wxPython you might also want to <a href="http://wiki.wxpython.org/wxPython%20Style%20Guide" rel="nofollow">check these</a> too.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>PEP 8 is good, the only thing that i wish it came down harder on was the Tabs-vs-Spaces holy war. </p>

<p>Basically if you are starting a project in python, you need to choose Tabs or Spaces and then shoot all offenders on sight. </p>

<p>An excerpt:</p>

<pre><code># dict's setdefault method turns this:
if key in dictobj:
    dictobj[key].append(val)
else:
    dictobj[key] = [val]
# into this:
dictobj.setdfault(key,[]).append(val)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I follow it extremely rigorously.  The only god before PEP-8 is existing code bases.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Yes, I try to follow it as closely as possible.</p>

<p>I don't follow any other coding standards.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I stick to PEP-8 very closely.</p>

<p>There are three specific things that I can't be bothered to change to PEP-8.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Avoid extraneous whitespace immediately inside parentheses, brackets or braces.</p>

<p>Suggested: <code>spam(ham[1], {eggs: 2})</code></p>

<p>I do this anyway:  <code>spam( ham[ 1 ], { eggs: 2 } )</code></p>

<p>Why?  30+ years of ingrained habit is snuggling ()'s up against function names or (in C) statements keywords.  Starting with Fortran IV in the 70's.</p></li>
<li><p>Use spaces around arithmetic operators:</p>

<p>Suggested:  <code>x = x * 2 - 1</code></p>

<p>I do this anyway: <code>x= x * 2 - 1</code></p>

<p>Why?  Gries' The Science of Programming suggested this as a way to emphasize the connection between assignment and the variable who's state is being changed.</p>

<p>It doesn't work well for multiple assignment or augmented assignment, for that I use lots of spaces.</p></li>
<li><p>For function names, method names and instance variable names</p>

<p>Suggested:  lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.</p>

<p>I do this anyway: camelCase</p>

<p>Why?  20+ years of ingrained habit of camelCase, starting with Pascal in the 80's.</p></li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>I follow the PEP8, it is a great piece of coding style.</p>
