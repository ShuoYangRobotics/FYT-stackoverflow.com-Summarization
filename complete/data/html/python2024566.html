<h3>Question (ID-2024566):</h3><h2>Access outer class from inner class in python</h2><p>I have a situation like so...</p>

<pre><code>class Outer(object):

    def some_method(self):
        # do something

    class Inner(object):
        def __init__(self):
            self.Outer.some_method()    # &lt;-- this is the line in question
</code></pre>

<p>How can I access the <code>Outer</code> class's method from the <code>Inner</code> class?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> -- Thanks for the responses.  I'm concluding that I need to re-assess how I had designed this to be implemented and come up with a more robust method.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The methods of a nested class cannot directly access the instance attributes of the outer class. </p>

<p>Note that it is not necessarily the case that an instance of the outer class exists even when you have created an instance of the inner class.</p>

<p>In fact, it is often recommended against using nested classes, since the nesting does not imply any particular relationship between the inner and outer classes.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Do you mean to use inheritance, rather than nesting classes like this? What you're doing doesn't make a heap of sense in Python.</p>

<p>You can access the <code>Outer</code>'s some_method by just referencing <code>Outer.some_method</code> within the inner class's methods, but it's not going to work as you expect it will. For example, if you try this:</p>

<pre><code>class Outer(object):

    def some_method(self):
        # do something

    class Inner(object):
        def __init__(self):
            Outer.some_method()
</code></pre>

<p>...you'll get a TypeError when initialising an <code>Inner</code> object, because <code>Outer.some_method</code> expects to receive an <code>Outer</code> instance as its first argument. (In the example above, you're basically trying to call <code>some_method</code> as a class method of <code>Outer</code>.)</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>maybe I'm mad but this seems very easy indeed - the thing is to make your inner class inside a method of the outer class... </p>

<pre><code>def do_sthg( self ):
    ...

def messAround( self ):

    outerClassSelf = self

    class mooble():
        def do_sthg_different( self ):
            ...
            outerClassSelf.do_sthg()
</code></pre>

<p>Plus... "self" is only used by convention, so you could do this:</p>

<pre><code>def do_sthg( self ):
    ...

def messAround( outerClassSelf ):

    class mooble():
        def do_sthg_different( self ):
            ...
            outerClassSelf.do_sthg()
</code></pre>

<p>It might be objected that you can't then create this inner class from outside the outer class... but this ain't true:</p>

<pre><code>class Bumblebee():

    def do_sthg( self ):
        print "sthg"

    def giveMeAnInnerClass( outerClassSelf ):

        class mooble():
            def do_sthg_different( self ):
                print "something diff\n"
                outerClassSelf.do_sthg()
        return mooble
</code></pre>

<p>then, somewhere miles away:</p>

<pre><code>blob = Bumblebee().giveMeAnInnerClass()()
blob.do_sthg_different()    
</code></pre>

<p>even push the boat out a bit and extend this inner class (NB to get super() to work you have to change the class signature of mooble to "class mooble( object )"</p>

<pre><code>class InnerBumblebeeWithAddedBounce( Bumblebee().giveMeAnInnerClass() ):
    def bounce( self ):
        print "bounce"

    def do_sthg_different( self ):
        super( InnerBumblebeeWithAddedBounce, self ).do_sthg_different()
        print "and more different"


ibwab = InnerBumblebeeWithAddedBounce()    
ibwab.bounce()
ibwab.do_sthg_different()

<p>Tweaked to suite your question, it is the answer:</p>

<pre><code>class Outer(object):
    def some_method(self):
        # do something

    class _Inner(object):
        def __init__(self, outer):
            outer.some_method()
    def Inner(self):
        return Inner(self)
</code></pre>

<p>Iâ€™m sure you can somehow write a decorator for this or something :)<br>

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Another possibility:</p>

<pre><code>class _Outer (object):
    # Define your static methods here, e.g.
    @staticmethod
    def subclassRef ():
        return Outer

class Outer (_Outer):
    class Inner (object):
        def outer (self):
            return _Outer

        def doSomething (self):
            outer = self.outer ()
            # Call your static mehthods.
            cls = outer.subclassRef ()
            return cls ()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You're trying to access Outer's class instance, from inner class instance. So just use factory-method to build Inner instance and pass Outer instance to it.</p>

<pre><code>class Outer(object):

    def createInner(self):
        return Outer.Inner(self)

    class Inner(object):
        def __init__(self, outer_instance):
            self.outer_instance = outer_instance
            self.outer_instance.somemethod()

        def inner_method(self):
            self.outer_instance.anothermethod()
</code></pre>
