<h3>Question (ID-9082099):</h3><h2>Python, loop through files in a folder and do a word count</h2><p>I am new to python and I need to write a script that counts all the words in all the txt files in a directory. This is what I have so far, the else works when just opening a txt file, but when I enter a directory it fails. I know I need an append somewhere, I have tried it a few different ways but with little luck.</p>

<p>*edit I would like the results to be lumped together. So far its 2 separate results. I tried making a new list and having it appended with counter. but it broke. Thanks again, this is a good community</p>

<pre><code>import re
import os
import sys
import os.path
import fnmatch
import collections

def search( file ):

    if os.path.isdir(path) == True:
        for root, dirs, files in os.walk(path):
            for file in files:
                words = re.findall('\w+', open(file).read().lower())
                ignore = ['the','a','if','in','it','of','or','on','and','to']
                counter=collections.Counter(x for x in words if x not in ignore)
                print(counter.most_common(10))

    else:
        words = re.findall('\w+', open(path).read().lower())
        ignore = ['the','a','if','in','it','of','or','on','and','to']
        counter=collections.Counter(x for x in words if x not in ignore)
        print(counter.most_common(10))

path = input("Enter file and path, place ' before and after the file path: ")
search(path)

raw_input("Press enter to close: ")

<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Change line 14 to:</p>

<pre><code>words = re.findall('\w+', open(os.path.join(root, file)).read().lower())
</code></pre>

<p>Also, if you replace the input line with</p>

<pre><code>path = raw_input("Enter file and path")
</code></pre>

<p>Then you won't need to include ' before and after the path</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>When iterating the results of <code>os.walk</code>, <code>file</code> will contain just the filename without the directory containing it. You need to join the directory name with the filename:</p>

<pre><code>for root, dirs, files in os.walk(path):
    for name in files:
        file_path = os.path.join(root, name)
        #do processing on file_path here
</code></pre>

<p>I recommend moving the code that processes a file to its own function - this way you won't need to write it twice, and it will be easier to debug problems.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>It looks like the parameter for the function definition is wrong.  It should be:</p>

<pre><code>def search(path):
</code></pre>

<p>The <em>ignore</em> is correct but can be made faster by using a set instead of a list:</p>

<pre><code>ignore = set(['the','a','if','in','it','of','or','on','and','to'])
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise, this is nice looking code :-)</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Change to:</p>

<pre><code>for file in files:
    fullPath="%s/%s"%(path,file)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>It's because the "files" list only contains the file names, not the full paths.
You have to use :</p>

<p>import os.path </p>

<p>...</p>

<p>and replace "open(file)" by "open(os.path.join(root,file))".</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I suggest looking at <a href="http://www.dabeaz.com/generators-uk/index.html" rel="nofollow">generator tricks for system programmers by David M. Beazley</a>. it shows how to create little generator loops to do everything you have here. Basically, using the <a href="http://www.dabeaz.com/generators-uk/gengrep.py" rel="nofollow">gengrep</a> example, but replacing grep with word counting:</p>

<pre><code># gencount.py
#
# Count the words in  a sequence of lines

import re, collections
def gen_count(lines):
    patc = re.compile('\w+')
    ignore = ['the','a','if','in','it','of','or','on','and','to']
    for line in lines:
        words = patc.findall(line)
        counter=collections.Counter(x for x in words if x not in ignore)
        for count in counter.most_common(10):
            yield count

# Example use

if __name__ == '__main__':
    from genfind import  gen_find
    from genopen import  gen_open
    from gencat  import  gen_cat
    path = raw_input("Enter file and path, place ' before and after the file path: ")

    findnames = gen_find("*.txt",path)
    openfiles = gen_open(findnames)
    alllines = gen_cat(openfiles)

    currcount = gen_count(alllines)
    for c in currcount:
        print c

<li>You should have two functions: one that goes through a file and counts the words, and another that goes through the files in a directory and recursively calls itself when it finds directories. The per-file function should take a full path to the file and open the file itself.</li>
<li>Reading the whole file in at once might run you out of memory. A line-by-line approach is better. Even better than that would be to write a generator function that reads, say, 4K at a time and outputs individual words, but that might be going overboard for this assignment.</li>
<li>Look at <code>os.path.walk()</code>.</li>
<li>Use <code>raw_input</code> if you're using Python 2. People <em>will</em> ignore that "quote the path" prompt.</li>
</ul>
