<h3>Question (ID-285132):</h3><h2>With what kind of IDE (if any) you build python GUI projects?</h2><p>Is there any IDE (like VS) with drag and drop support for building python GUI, connecting to dbs etc?
Eventhough I am an emacs guy, I find it much easier to create GUI with VS.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-9):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The short answer is "no".  There is not a swiss-army-knife like IDE that is both a full-featured Python code-editor and a full-featured WYSIWYG GUI editor.  However, there are several stand-alone tools that make creating a GUI easier and there are a myriad of code editors, so if you can handle having two windows open, then you can accomplish what you are trying to.</p>

<p>As for stand-alone GUI editors, which you choose is going to depend on what library you choose to develop your GUI with.  I would recommend using <a href="http://www.gtk.org/" rel="nofollow">GTK+</a>, which binds to Python via <a href="http://www.pygtk.org/" rel="nofollow">PyGtk</a> and has the <a href="http://glade.gnome.org/" rel="nofollow">Glade</a> GUI designer.  I believe that there are other GUI libraries for Python that have WYSIWYG designers (Qt, Tkinter, wxWindows, etc.), but GTK+ is the one I have the most experience with so I will leave the others for other commentators.</p>

<p>Note, however, that the designer in this case is not at all language dependent.  It just spits out a .glade file that could be loaded into any language that has GTK+ bindings.  If you are looking for a designer that produces raw Python code (like the Code-Behind model that VS.Net uses), then I am not aware of any.</p>

<p>As for general code-editing IDE's (that do not include a GUI designer), there are <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments" rel="nofollow">many</a>, of which <a href="http://pydev.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">PyDev</a>/<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/" rel="nofollow">Eclipse</a> is probably the most Visual Studio-like.</p>

<p>(Revised for clarity.)</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Also for PyGTK, there is <a href="http://gazpacho.sicem.biz/" rel="nofollow">Gazpacho</a>, it's pure python which makes adding your own custom widgets easier, and already has gtkbuilder support.</p>

<p>I took over maintenance of the project a few months ago, and we plan to release it under the umbrella of the <a href="http://pida.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">PIDA IDE</a>, in a more Visual Studio-like setup. Patches accepted!</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>For GUI only, I find VisualWx (<a href="http://visualwx.altervista.org/" rel="nofollow">http://visualwx.altervista.org/</a>) to be very good for designing wxPython apps under Windows.</p>

<p>For GUI + database, dabo (<a href="http://dabodev.com/" rel="nofollow">http://dabodev.com/</a>) is probably a good answer.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>If your into QT <a href="http://die-offenbachs.de/eric/index.html" rel="nofollow">EricIDE</a> is a good choice</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I'm not really a Pythonista, but I <em>am</em> a Mac user and I appreciate a good, native interface in the apps I write and use. So, if I were to use Python for a GUI app on the Mac, I'd use PyObjC with Interface Builder and Xcode, rather than a cross-platform solution.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/" rel="nofollow">Eclipse</a> has python support.</p>

<p>There's also <a href="http://www.python.org/idle/doc/idle2.html" rel="nofollow">IDLE</a> or <a href="http://www.wingware.com/" rel="nofollow">Wingware</a>, though I'm not sure of their GUI support.</p>

<p>I'm sure a good <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=python+ide" rel="nofollow">google search</a> would turn up more.</p>

<p>But in the end, I doubt it.  Python is dependent on third-party widget sets like Qt, Tk, Gtk, wxWidgets, etc for GUI support.  Each of those will have their own system for laying things out.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>You can try <a href="http://boa-constructor.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">Boa Constructor</a> or <a href="http://www.dabodev.com/" rel="nofollow">Dabo</a></p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>I'm a GNOME guy, so I prefer PyGTK. The standard GUI builder for that is the <a href="http://glade.gnome.org/" rel="nofollow">Glade Interface Designer</a> (until it transitions to GtkBuilder).</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>For <a href="http://wxpython.org/" rel="nofollow">wxPython</a> I use <a href="http://xrced.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">xrced</a> to make GUI definitions contained in xml files, I find this way to be elegant and scalable.</p>

<p><a href="http://wxformbuilder.org/" rel="nofollow">wxformbuilder</a> is also good.</p>

<p>As for the IDE, I'm a <a href="http://www.wingware.com/" rel="nofollow">WingIDE</a> fan.</p>
