<h3>Question (ID-259160):</h3><h2>Did anyone try Portable Python?</h2><p>I have recently discovered <a href="http://www.portablepython.com/" rel="nofollow">Portable Python</a> as a very interesting tool. I am a linux user, and I am frutstrated when I come to machines that does not come "battery included". </p>

<p>This is cool because it's non obtrusive : I don't want to install Python in any windows that passed in my hands...</p>

<p>But I don't know if it's reliable. If I make a product exhibition with it, would it be risky ?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You may want to check out <a href="http://web2py.com/" rel="nofollow">web2py</a>.  The windows executable includes python and does run without installation for example from a usb drive, like portable python. But it includes more goodies such as a web server, web based editor and plug and play web applications.</p>

<p>web2py is stable (currently version  1.46)</p>

<p>web2py exposes a python shell</p>

<pre><code>web2py.exe -S yourappname -M
</code></pre>

<p>There is also a web based python shell available.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I have been using Portable Python for about 3 months and have had no problems with it. You don't get the features of Movable Python but Portable Python is free.</p>

<p>I have it on a thumbdrive that I take to work (Windows computers) so I can work on projects there. Then I can take it home and import the projects into Linux/Mac for refinement.</p>

<p>I have installed wxPython, wxGlade, and <a href="http://www.instantdjango.com/" rel="nofollow">portable Django</a> on the thumbdrive also, creating an all-in-one Python development environment.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>There is another alternative: <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/movpy/" rel="nofollow">Movable Python</a></p>

<p>From its web site:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Movable Python is a distribution of
  Python for Windows that doesn't need
  to be installed. It easily fits onto a
  USB memory stick or flash drive.
  Python on a stick. Smile</p>
  
  <p>It includes an IDE and many common
  Python extensions, to make Movable
  Python a portable Build, Test, and Run
  environment. It has a nice GUI to
  launch programs and control its
  behaviour.</p>
</blockquote>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I think <a href="http://www.activestate.com/activepython/" rel="nofollow">ActivePython</a> might be a better fit for what you're trying to do.  It comes as a zip file that is easily usable on any Windows machine, is available for versions from 1.6 through 3.1, and doesn't carry any kind of "we'll eat a puppy if you use this in production" disclaimer.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>From the Download page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Important!</p>
  
  <p>This is beta software and it is NOT
  recomended for production
  environments. Recomended use is for
  development/showcasing/experimenting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the other hand, if you're doing product exhibition, you'll be doing it on a machine that you can test with before hand and make sure that everything works as expected.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Do you want to make a portable demo of some python code? The better solution is to use <a href="http://www.py2exe.org/" rel="nofollow">Py2Exe</a> or a similar tool and make a portable executable. </p>
