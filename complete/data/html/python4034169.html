<h3>Question (ID-4034169):</h3><h2>How can I use HTML + Javascript to build a python GUI?</h2><p>I have been experimenting with Appcelerator Titanum yesterday and I think it's cool when it comes to Javascript.  </p>

<p>Python features on Appcelerator Titanum are so limited (can't use some modules for example).  </p>

<p><strong>My question is How can I use html &amp; javascript as a GUI tool for a <em>real python application</em> ?</strong>  </p>

<p>I am running windows 7 and i was thinking of using <strong>webkit</strong> for that purpose but couldn't know how to work with it in python.  </p>

<p>I am planning to make a standalone executable using py2exe as I don't know if the users always have python and the appropriate modules installed.</p>

<p>You run a web server on your desktop.  For example, this: <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/simplehttpserver.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/library/simplehttpserver.html</a>  In a few lines of code you can provide a complete HTTP server that will serve your HTML and Javascript to a browser.</p>

<p>Hard to parse that.  It either indicates too much coffee or no familiarity with punctuation.</p>

<p>Randomly, I'll pick the following words as possibly being meaningful.</p>

<p>You run a web server on your desktop.  The web server provides html and javascript pages to a browser -- also running on your desktop.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>If you're after webkit bindings for Python, look at PyQt, which includes Webkit, as well as wxWebkit (<a href="http://wxwebkit.wxcommunity.com/" rel="nofollow">http://wxwebkit.wxcommunity.com/</a>) if you're using wxWidgets. This lets you embed webkit in a Qt or Wxwidgets app so that you won't have to go through a browser.</p>

<p>If you do use this, then you can either use a web server in Python, like others have mentioned, or you can control the Webkit control directly (though I'm not sure how practical this is).</p>

<p>Beyond that, there's also Pyjamas Desktop (<a href="http://pyjs.org/" rel="nofollow">http://pyjs.org/</a>), which lets you use Pyjamas to build the application, then run it.</p>

<p>But I'm not sure if it runs on Windows.</p>

<p>PyQt and Webkit would work on Windows.</p>

<p>But really. If you want to make a desktop application you are better of with just PyQt ;)</p>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I assume you are mobilizing a web-application for cross platform access.</p>

<p>If so have you considered abstracting the cross platform access at the web-app presentation layer ?</p>

<p>Appcelerator / Webkit does not provide true native look-and-feel on mobile devices but this is where a new technology can help. </p>
