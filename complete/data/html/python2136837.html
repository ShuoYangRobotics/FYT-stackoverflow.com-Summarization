<h3>Question (ID-2136837):</h3><h2>Process to convert simple Python script into Windows executable</h2><p>I wrote a script that will help a Windows user in her daily life. I want to simply send her the .exe and not ask her to install python, dlls or have to deal with any additional files.</p>

<p>I've read plenty of the stackoverflow entries regarding compiling Python scripts into executable files. I am a bit confused as there are many options but some seem dated (no updates since 2008) and none were simple enough for me not to be asking this right now after a few hours spent on this. </p>

<p>I'm hoping there's a better, up-to-date way to do this.</p>

<p>I looked into:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/pylunch/" rel="nofollow">pylunch</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.py2exe.org/" rel="nofollow">py2exe</a></li>
<li><a href="http://cx-freeze.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">cx_Freeze</a></li>
<li><a href="http://svn.pythonmac.org/py2app/py2app/trunk/doc/index.html" rel="nofollow">py2app</a> (only for Mac)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.pyinstaller.org/" rel="nofollow">pyinstaller</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bbfreeze/" rel="nofollow">bbfreeze</a></li>
</ul>

<p>but either I couldn't get them to work or couldn't understand how to get the result I need. The closest I got was with py2exe but it still gave me the MSVCR71.dll</p>

<p>I would appreciate a step-by-step answer as I was also unable to follow some of the tweaking answers here that require some prior understanding of how to use py2exe or some of the other tools.</p>

<p>I'm using Python 2.5 as one of the modules is only available for that version.</p>

<p>There's a simple PyInstaller tutorial <a href="http://bytes.com/topic/python/insights/579554-simple-guide-using-pyinstaller" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  If you have any questions about using it, please post them...</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Using py2exe, include this in your setup.py:  </p>

<pre><code>from distutils.core import setup
import py2exe, sys, os

sys.argv.append('py2exe')

setup(
    options = {'py2exe': {'bundle_files': 1}},
    windows = [{'script': "YourScript.py"}],
    zipfile = None,
)
</code></pre>

<p>then you can run it through command prompt / Idle, both works for me. Hope it helps</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I would join @Nicholas in recommending <a href="http://www.pyinstaller.org/" rel="nofollow">PyInstaller</a> (with the <code>--onefile</code> flag), but <em>be warned</em>: do <strong>not</strong> use the "latest release", PyInstaller 1.3 -- it's <em>years</em> old.  Use the "pre-release" 1.4, download it <a href="http://www.pyinstaller.org/changeset/latest/trunk?old_path=%2F&amp;format=zip" rel="nofollow">here</a> -- or even better the code from the <a href="http://www.pyinstaller.org/export/latest/trunk/" rel="nofollow">svn repo</a> -- install SVN and run <code>svn co <a href="http://svn.pyinstaller.org/trunk" rel="nofollow">http://svn.pyinstaller.org/trunk</a> pyinstaller</code>.</p>

<p>As @Nicholas implies, dynamic libraries cannot be <em>run</em> from the same file as the rest of the executable -- but fortunately they can be <em>packed</em> together with all the rest in a "self-unpacking" executable that will unpack itself into some temporary directory as needed; PyInstaller does a good job at this (and at many other things -- <code>py2exe</code> is more popular, but <code>pyinstaller</code> in my opinion is preferable in all other respects).</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>you may want to see if your app can run under IronPython. If so, you can compile it to an exe

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>The other way you can do is use any of those program and pack it to self extracting exe by using <strong>WinRAR</strong> or archiving softwares, set the main exe file to load after extract.
They will extract it to TEMP folder and will run the main exe for you.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>If you use IronPython (I'm developing a commercial software in it be aware that it requires .NET Framework 2.0 )</p>
