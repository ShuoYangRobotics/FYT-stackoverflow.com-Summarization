<h3>Question (ID-3643065):</h3><h2>Replace non-numeric characters</h2><p>I need to replace non-numeric chars from a string.</p>

<p>For example, "8-4545-225-144" needs to be "84545225144"; "$334fdf890==-" must be "334890".</p>

<p>How can I do this?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><pre><code>''.join(c for c in S if c.isdigit())
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>It is possible with regex.</p>

<pre><code>import re

...

return re.sub(r'\D', '', theString)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><code>filter(str.isdigit, s)</code> is faster and IMO clearer than anything else listed here.</p>

<p>It will also throw a TypeError if s is a unicode type. Depending on what definition of "digits" you want, this can be more or less useful than the alternative <code>filter(type(s).isdigit, s)</code>, slightly slower but still faster than the re and comprehension versions for me.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Although if you are a poor sucker stuck with Python 3, you will need to use <code>"".join(filter(str.isdigit, s))</code> which puts you firmly in the realm of equivalently bad performance. Such progress.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Let's time the <code>join</code> and the <code>re</code> versions:    </p>

<pre><code>In [3]: import re

In [4]: def withRe(theString): return re.sub('\D', '', theString)
   ...:

In [5]:

In [6]: def withJoin(S): return ''.join(c for c in S if c.isdigit())
   ...:


In [11]: s = "8-4545-225-144"

In [12]: %timeit withJoin(s)
100000 loops, best of 3: 6.89 us per loop

In [13]: %timeit withRe(s)
100000 loops, best of 3: 4.77 us per loop
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>join</code> version is much nicer, compared to the <code>re</code> one, but unfortunately is 50% slower. So if the performance is an issue, the elegance might need to be sacrificed. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<pre><code>In [16]: def withFilter(s): return filter(str.isdigit, s)
   ....:
In [19]: %timeit withFilter(s)
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.75 us per loop
</code></pre>

<p>It looks like <code>filter</code> is the performance and readability winner</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Although a little more complicated to set up, using the <code>translate()</code> string method to delete the characters as shown below can as much as 4-6 times faster than using <code>join()</code> or <code>re.sub()</code> according to timing tests I performed -- so if it is something done many times, you might want to consider using this instead.</p>

<pre><code>nonnumerics = ''.join(c for c in ''.join(chr(i) for i in range(256)) if not c.isdigit())

astring = '123-$ab #6789'
print astring.translate(None, nonnumerics)
# 1236789
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I prefer regular expressions, so here's a way if you like</p>

<pre><code>import re
myStr = '$334fdf890==-'
digts = re.sub('[^0-9]','',myStr) 
</code></pre>

<p>This should replace all nonnumeric occurences with '' i.e. with nothing. So digts variable should be '334890'</p>
