<h3>Question (ID-4618298):</h3><h2>randomly mix lines of 3 million-line file</h2><p>Everything is in the title. I'm wondering if any one knows a quick and with reasonable memory demands way of randomly mixing all the lines of a 3 million lines file. I guess it is not possible with a simple vim command, so any simple script using python or fortran may be an option too... I tried with python by using a random number generator, but did not manage to find a simple way out.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

with open('the_file','r') as source:
    data = [ (random.random(), line) for line in source ]
data.sort()
with open('another_file','w') as target:
    for _, line in data:
        target.write( line )
</code></pre>

<p>That should do it.  3 million lines will fit into most machine's memory unless the lines are HUGE (over 512 characters).</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Takes only a few seconds in Python:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import random
&gt;&gt;&gt; lines = open('3mil.txt').readlines()
&gt;&gt;&gt; random.shuffle(lines)
&gt;&gt;&gt; open('3mil.txt', 'w').writelines(lines)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>On many systems the <code>sort</code> shell command takes <code>-R</code> to randomize its input.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Here's another version</p>

<p>At the shell, use this.</p>

<pre><code>python decorate.py | sort | python undecorate.py
</code></pre>

<p>decorate.py</p>

<pre><code>import sys
import random
for line in sys.stdin:
    sys.stdout.write( "{0}|{1}".format( random.random(), line ) )
</code></pre>

<p>undecorate.py</p>

<pre><code>import sys
for line in sys.stdin:
    _, _, data= line.partition("|")
    sys.stdout.write( line )
</code></pre>

<p>Uses almost no memory.  </p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>This is the same as Mr. Kugelman's, but using vim's built-in python interface:</p>

<pre><code>:py import vim, random as r; cb = vim.current.buffer ; l = cb[:] ; r.shuffle(l) ; cb[:] = l
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Found this page which has a solution (not sure it will work or not):

<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>If you do <em>not</em> want to load everything into memory and sort it there, you <em>have</em> to store the lines on disk while doing random sorting. That will be very slow.</p>

<p>Here is a very simple, stupid and slow version. Note that this may take a surprising amount of diskspace, and it will be very slow. I ran it with 300.000 lines, and it takes several minutes. 3 million lines could very well take an hour. So: Do it in memory. Really. It's not that big.</p>

<pre><code>import os
import tempfile
import shutil
import random
tempdir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
print tempdir

files = []
# Split the lines:
with open('/tmp/sorted.txt', 'rt') as infile:
    counter = 0    
    for line in infile:
        outfilename = os.path.join(tempdir, '%09i.txt' % counter)
        with open(outfilename, 'wt') as outfile:
            outfile.write(line)
        counter += 1
        files.append(outfilename)

with open('/tmp/random.txt', 'wt') as outfile:
    while files:
        index = random.randint(0, len(files) - 1)
        filename = files.pop(index)
        outfile.write(open(filename, 'rt').read())

shutil.rmtree(tempdir)
</code></pre>

<p>Another version would be to store the files in an SQLite database and pull the lines randomly from that database. That is probably going to be faster than this.</p>
