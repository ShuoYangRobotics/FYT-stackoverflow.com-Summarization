<p>My solution:</p>

<pre><code>#returns a list of the divisors of a given number
def Divs(Number):
    Divisors = []

    for i in range(2 , int(Number**0.5) + 1):
        if Number % i == 0:
            Divisors.append(i)

    for q in range(len(Divisors)):
        if Divisors[q] != (Number / Divisors[q]):
            Divisors.append(Number / Divisors[q])

    Divisors.insert(0,1)
    return Divisors

#returns a list of abundant numbers up to and including the limit
def AbList(limit):
    Abundant = []

    for i in range(11,limit + 1):
        if sum(Divs(i)) &gt; i:
            Abundant.append(i)

    return Abundant

#Finds the sum of all positive integers that cannot be written as the
#sum of two abundant numbers...
def AbSum(limit):
    Abundant = AbList(limit)
    NoAbSum = 0
    for i in range(1 , limit):
        AbSum = 0
        x = 0
        for x in Abundant:
            if i - x in Abundant[:i]:
                AbSum = 1
                break
        if AbSum == 0:
            NoAbSum += i
    return NoAbSum

<p>Alright, so this took my 3.4 GhZ processor about 15 minutes to solve. I have spent hours searching for a better way, but I simply can't think of anything. For now, I'm not concerned with the first two functions, because together they take less than a second to run. The third function is the kicker here. It runs through the range of numbers up to the limit (in this case, 20000-something), and each time, it runs through the list of abundant numbers, subtracting each from the current number, then checking that answer against the list of abundant numbers. If there is a match, the loop breaks and tries again with the next number, all the way up to the limit.</p>

<p>I know there has got to be a better way of doing this. Any suggestions? Also, a disclaimer: I'm somewhat new to programming. Go easy on me :)</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You're testing every number between 1 and the limit (let's say 30000) against every abundant number, so you're doing roughly 30000 * 7428 iterations; and you're checking if the result is in a list, which is a very slow operation -- it checks every item on the list until it finds a match!</p>

<p>Instead, you should <em>generate</em> every number that is a sum of two abundant numbers. At the most, that would take 7428 * 7428 iterations -- fewer if properly executed (hint: avoid checking both a + b and b + a by ensuring that b is always >= a; and as someone else suggested, be sure to stop when sums get too large). Mark those numbers off a list of numbers below <code>limit</code> and sum the remaining numbers. </p>

<p>In other words:</p>

<pre><code>[... 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43 ...]
</code></pre>

<p>becomes</p>

<pre><code>[... 31, 0, 33, 34, 35, 0, 37, 0, 39, 0, 41, 0, 43 ...]
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Edit: After playing with implementations for a few minutes, I can confidently say that <code>if i - x in Abundant[:i]:</code> is the problem. The first python solution posted to Project Euler's p23 forum is essentially a clever implementation of your algorithm, the only major difference being that it uses a <em>set</em> of abundant numbers instead of a list. It solves the problem on an Atom processor in 15 seconds; when I changed it to use a list, after fifteen minutes, it still hadn't solved the problem. </p>

<p>Moral of the story: <code>x in list</code> is SLOW.</p>

<p>Still, generating the sums directly is faster than subtracting and checking. :)</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><pre><code>    for x in Abundant:
        if i - x in Abundant[:i]:
            AbSum = 1
            break
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the <code>in</code> expression here takes O(i) time, and thus the loop is O(nÂ²).  You can improve this to O(n) if you use a <code>set</code> instead of a <code>list</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Let's start by searching a little bit, and find out the largest number not expressible as the sum of two abundant numbers is actually 20161. Then, we can solve the problem with a simple set membership test. Plus, it runs pretty fast. :-)</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
from math import sqrt

def d(n):
    sum = 1
    t = sqrt(n)
    # only proper divisors; start from 2.
    for i in range(2, int(t)+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            sum += i + n / i
    # don't count the square root twice!
    if t == int(t):
        sum -= t
    return sum

limit = 20162
sum = 0
# it's a set, after all. sets are faster than lists for our needs.
abn = set()
for n in range(1, limit):
    if d(n) &gt; n:
        abn.add(n)
    # if the difference of the number we're examining and every number in the set
    # is in the set, then the number is the sum of two abundant numbers.
    # otherwise, we must add it to our sum in question.
    if not any( (n-a in abn) for a in abn ):
        sum += n

<p>Runs in 0.6463340939061518 seconds on average on an i5, based on <code>timeit</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>One thing that would help is bailing out of your inner loop once the abundant numbers go larger than the one you're testing.</p>

<p>I also don't understand this bit of your code:</p>

<pre><code> for q in range(len(Divisors)):
    if Divisors[q] != (Number / Divisors[q]):
        Divisors.append(Number / Divisors[q])
</code></pre>

<p>Once you have verified that the modulo is 0, it's a divisor. I don't know why you're doing an identity check essentially.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Your code looks like it might benefit from map, filter or list comprehension in favour of those for loops.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You can use a simple mathematical trick: The sum of all numbers that <em>can not be written</em> as a sum of two abundant numbers is the sum of <em>all numbers</em> minus the numbers that <em>can be written</em> as a sum of two abundant numbers:</p>

<pre><code> solution = sum(range(limit)) - sum(all_two_sums(abundant_numbers))
</code></pre>

<p>(<code>sum(range(limit))</code> can also be simplified with math, but you might not find it unless you're Gauss ;-))</p>

<p>You already have a list of abundant numbers, so it's relatively easy to create the set of numbers that <em>can</em> be written as the sum of two abundant numbers and where the sum is smaller than the limit. Just make sure you have no duplicate numbers, a Python <code>set</code> does that.</p>
