<h3>Question (ID-333995):</h3><h2>How to detect that Python code is being executed through the debugger?</h2><p>Is there a simple way to detect, within Python code, that this code is being executed through the Python debugger?</p>

<p>I have a small Python application that uses Java code (thanks to JPype). When I'm debugging the Python part, I'd like the embedded JVM to be given debug options too.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Python debuggers (as well as profilers and coverage tools) use the <code>sys.settrace</code> function (in the <code>sys</code> module) to register a callback that gets called when interesting events happen.</p>

<p>If you're using Python 2.6, you can call <code>sys.gettrace()</code> to get the current trace callback function. If it's not <code>None</code> then you can assume you should be passing debug parameters to the JVM.</p>

<p>It's not clear how you could do this pre 2.6.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>From taking a quick look at the pdb docs and source code, it doesn't look like there is a built in way to do this.  I suggest that you set an environment variable that indicates debugging is in progress and have your application respond to that.</p>

<pre><code>$ USING_PDB=1 pdb yourprog.py
</code></pre>

<p>Then in yourprog.py:</p>

<pre><code>import os
if os.environ.get('USING_PDB'):
    # debugging actions
    pass
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You can try to peek into your stacktrace.</p>

<p>when you try this in a debugger session:</p>

<p>import inspect
inspect.getouterframes(inspect.currentframe()
you will get a list of framerecords and can peek for any frames that refer to the pdb file.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>A solution working with Python 2.4 (it should work with any version superior to 2.1) and Pydev:</p>

<pre><code>import inspect

def isdebugging():
  for frame in inspect.stack():
    if frame[1].endswith("pydevd.py"):
      return True
  return False
</code></pre>

<p>The same should work with pdb by simply replacing <code>pydevd.py</code> with <code>pdb.py</code>. As do3cc suggested, it tries to find the debugger within the stack of the caller.</p>

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>If you're using Pydev, you can detect it in such way:</p>

<pre><code>import sys
if 'pydevd' in sys.modules: 
    print "Debugger"
else:
    print "commandline"
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Another way to do it hinges on how your python interpreter is started.  It requires you start Python using -O for production and with no -O for debugging.  So it does require an external discipline that might be hard to maintain .. but then again it might fit your processes perfectly.</p>

<p>From the python docs (see "Built-in Constants" <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/constants.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> or <a href="http://docs.python.org/release/3.1.3/library/constants.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>):</p>

<pre><code>__debug__
This constant is true if Python was not started with an -O option.
</code></pre>

<p>Usage would be something like:</p>

<pre><code>if __debug__:
    print 'Python started without optimization'
</code></pre>
