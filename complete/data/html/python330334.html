<h3>Question (ID-330334):</h3><h2>Parsing a string for nested patterns</h2><p>What would be the best way to do this.</p>

<p>The input string is </p>

<pre><code>&lt;133_3&gt;&lt;135_3&gt;&lt;116_2&gt;The other system worked for about 1 month&lt;/116_2&gt; got some good images &lt;137_3&gt;on it then it started doing the same thing as the first one&lt;/137_3&gt; so then I quit using either camera now they are just sitting and collecting dust.&lt;/135_3&gt;&lt;/133_3&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>the expected output is </p>

<pre><code>{'The other system worked for about 1 month got some good images on it then it started doing the same thing as the first one so then I quit \
using either camera now they are just sitting and collecting dust.':[133, 135],

'The other system worked for about 1 month': [116],

'on it then it started doing the same thing as the first one':[137]

}
</code></pre>

<p>that seems like a recursive regexp search but I can't figure out how exactly.</p>

<p>I can think of a tedious recursive function as of now, but have a feeling that there should be a better way.</p>

<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Take an XML parser, make it generate a DOM (Document Object Model) and then build a recursive algorithm that traverses all the nodes, calls "text()" in each node (that should give you the text in the current node and all children) and puts that as a key in the dictionary.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Use expat or another XML parser; it's more explicit than anything else, considering you're dealing with XML data anyway.</p>

<p>However, note that XML element names can't start with a number as your example has them.</p>

<p>Here's a parser that will do what you need, although you'll need to tweak it to combine duplicate elements into one dict key:</p>

<pre><code>from xml.parsers.expat import ParserCreate

open_elements = {}
result_dict = {}

def start_element(name, attrs):
    open_elements[name] = True

def end_element(name):
    del open_elements[name]

def char_data(data):
    for element in open_elements:
        cur = result_dict.setdefault(element, '')
        result_dict[element] = cur + data

if __name__ == '__main__':
    p = ParserCreate()

    p.StartElementHandler = start_element
    p.EndElementHandler = end_element
    p.CharacterDataHandler = char_data

    p.Parse(u'&lt;_133_3&gt;&lt;_135_3&gt;&lt;_116_2&gt;The other system worked for about 1 month&lt;/_116_2&gt; got some good images &lt;_137_3&gt;on it then it started doing the same thing as the first one&lt;/_137_3&gt; so then I quit using either camera now they are just sitting and collecting dust.&lt;/_135_3&gt;&lt;/_133_3&gt;', 1)

    print result_dict

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><pre><code>from cStringIO   import StringIO
from collections import defaultdict
####from xml.etree   import cElementTree as etree
from lxml import etree

xml = "&lt;e133_3&gt;&lt;e135_3&gt;&lt;e116_2&gt;The other system worked for about 1 month&lt;/e116_2&gt; got some good images &lt;e137_3&gt;on it then it started doing the same thing as the first one&lt;/e137_3&gt; so then I quit using either camera now they are just sitting and collecting dust. &lt;/e135_3&gt;&lt;/e133_3&gt;"

d = defaultdict(list)
for event, elem in etree.iterparse(StringIO(xml)):
    d[''.join(elem.itertext())].append(int(elem.tag[1:-2]))

print(dict(d.items()))
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>{'on it then it started doing the same thing as the first one': [137], 
'The other system worked for about 1 month': [116],

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I think a grammar would be the best option here. I found a link with some information:
<a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/python/2006/01/26/pyparsing.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/python/2006/01/26/pyparsing.html</a></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Note that you can't actually solve this by a regular expression, since they don't have the expressive power to enforce proper nesting.</p>

<p>Take the following mini-language:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>A certain number of "(" followed by the same number of ")", no matter what the number.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>You could make a regular expression very easily to represent a super-language of this mini-language (where you don't enforce the equality of the number of starts parentheses and end parentheses). You could also make a regular expression very easilty to represent any finite sub-language (where you limit yourself to some max depth of nesting). But you can never represent this exact language in a regular expression.</p>

<p>So you'd have to use a grammar, yes.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Here's an unreliable inefficient recursive regexp solution:</p>

<pre><code>import re

re_tag = re.compile(r'&lt;(?P&lt;tag&gt;[^&gt;]+)&gt;(?P&lt;content&gt;.*?)&lt;/(?P=tag)&gt;', re.S)

def iterparse(text, tag=None):
    if tag is not None: yield tag, text
    for m in re_tag.finditer(text):
        for tag, text in iterparse(m.group('content'), m.group('tag')):
            yield tag, text

def strip_tags(content):
    nested = lambda m: re_tag.sub(nested, m.group('content'))
    return re_tag.sub(nested, content)


txt = "&lt;133_3&gt;&lt;135_3&gt;&lt;116_2&gt;The other system worked for about 1 month&lt;/116_2&gt; got some good images &lt;137_3&gt;on it then it started doing the same thing as the first one&lt;/137_3&gt; so then I quit using either camera now they are just sitting and collecting dust. &lt;/135_3&gt;&lt;/133_3&gt;"
d = {}
for tag, text in iterparse(txt):
    d.setdefault(strip_tags(text), []).append(int(tag[:-2]))

print(d)
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>{'on it then it started doing the same thing as the first one': [137], 
 'The other system worked for about 1 month': [116], 
 'The other system worked for about 1 month got some good images on it then it started doing the same thing as the first one so then I quit using \
 either camera now they are just sitting and collecting dust. ': [133, 135]}
