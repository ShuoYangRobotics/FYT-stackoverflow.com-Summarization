<h3>Question (ID-3114252):</h3><h2>One-liner to check whether an iterator yields at least one element?</h2><p>Currently I'm doing this:</p>

<pre><code>try:
    something = iterator.next()
    # ...
except StopIteration:
    # ...
</code></pre>

<p>But I would like an expression that I can place inside a simple <code>if</code> statement.
Is there anything built-in which would make this code look less clumsy?</p>

<p><code>any()</code> returns <code>False</code> if an iterable is empty, but it will potentially iterate over all the items if it's not.
I only need it to check the first item.</p>

<hr>

<p>Someone asks what I'm trying to do.
I have written a function which executes an SQL query and yields its results.
Sometimes when I call this function I just want to know if the query returned anything and make a decision based on that.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>In Python 2.6+, if name <code>sentinel</code> is bound to a value which the iterator can't possibly yield,</p>

<pre><code>if next(iterator, sentinel) is sentinel:
    print('iterator was empty')
</code></pre>

<p>If you have no idea of what the iterator might possibly yield, make your own sentinel (e.g. at the top of your module) with</p>

<pre><code>sentinel = object()
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise, you could use, in the sentinel role, any value which you "know" (based on application considerations) that the iterator can't possibly yield.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>This isn't really cleaner, but it shows a way to package it in a function losslessly:</p>

<pre><code>def has_elements(iter):
  from itertools import tee
  iter, any_check = tee(iter)
  try:
    any_check.next()
    return True, iter
  except StopIteration:
    return False, iter

has_el, iter = has_elements(iter)
if has_el:
  # not empty
</code></pre>

<p>This isn't really pythonic, and for particular cases, there are probably better (but less general) solutions, like the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#next" rel="nofollow">next</a> default. </p>

<pre><code>first = next(iter, None)
if first:
  # Do something
</code></pre>

<p>This isn't general because None can be a valid element in many iterables. </p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><code>any</code> won't go beyond the first element if it's True. In case the iterator yields something false-ish you can write <code>any(True for _ in iterator)</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>you can use:</p>

<pre><code>if zip([None], iterator):
    # ...
else:
    # ...
</code></pre>

<p>but it's a bit nonexplanatory for the code reader</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>This is an overkill iterator wrapper that generally allows to check whether there's a next item (via conversion to boolean).  Of course pretty inefficient.</p>

<pre><code>class LookaheadIterator ():

    def __init__(self, iterator):
        self.__iterator = iterator
        try:
            self.__next      = next (iterator)
            self.__have_next = True
        except StopIteration:
            self.__have_next = False

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def next (self):
        if self.__have_next:
            result = self.__next
            try:
                self.__next      = next (self.__iterator)
                self.__have_next = True
            except StopIteration:
                self.__have_next = False

            return result

        else:
            raise StopIteration

    def __nonzero__(self):
        return self.__have_next

x = LookaheadIterator (iter ([]))
print bool (x)
print list (x)

x = LookaheadIterator (iter ([1, 2, 3]))
print bool (x)
print list (x)
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>False
[]
True
[1, 2, 3]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p><code>__length_hint__</code> <em>estimates</em> the length of <code>list(it)</code> - it's private method, though:</p>

<pre><code>x = iter( (1, 2, 3) )
help(x.__length_hint__)
      1 Help on built-in function __length_hint__:
      2 
      3 __length_hint__(...)
      4     Private method returning an estimate of len(list(it)).
