<h3>Question (ID-1947030):</h3><h2>Ternary Operator - Python</h2><pre><code>def val():
    var = float(raw_input("Age:"))
    status = ("Working","Retired")[var&gt;65]
    print "You should be:",status
</code></pre>

<p>I was looking on how the ternary operator is implemented in python. I found the code mentioned above as a substitute (from what i have read, found that the ternary operator does not exist, I will be happy to know more about it.). I couldn't understand how the code works, can anyone explain me how actually the code is working. Am also interested to know why the ternary operator doesn't exist Any references or links about this will be more useful. </p>

<p>ps: The version am using is 2.6.4 on Windows Vista</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-12):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Python has a construct that is sort of like the ternary operator in C, et al. It works something like this:</p>

<pre><code>my_var = "Retired" if age &gt; 65 else "Working"
</code></pre>

<p>and is equivalent to this C code:</p>

<pre><code>my_var = age &gt; 65 ? "Retired" : "Working";
</code></pre>

<p>As for how the code you posted works, let's step through it:</p>

<pre><code>("Working","Retired")
</code></pre>

<p>creates a 2-tuple (an immutable list) with the element "Working" at index 0, and "Retired" at index 1.</p>

<pre><code>var&gt;65
</code></pre>

<p>returns True if var is greater than 65, False if not. When applied to an index, it is converted into 1 (True) or 0 (False). Thus, this boolean value provides an index into the tuple created on the same line.</p>

<p>Why hasn't Python always had a ternary operator? The simple answer is the Guido van Rossum, the author of Python, didn't like/didn't want it, apparently believing that it was an unnecessary construct that could lead to confusing code (and anyone who's seen massively-nested ternary operators in C can probably agree). But for Python 2.5, he relented and added the grammar seen above.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Python (2.5 and above) does indeed have a syntax for what you are looking for:</p>

<pre><code>x = foo if condition else bar
</code></pre>

<p>If <code>condition</code> is True, <code>x</code> will be set to <code>foo</code>, otherwise it will be set to <code>bar</code>.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; age = 68
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 'Retired' if age &gt; 65 else 'Working'
&gt;&gt;&gt; x
'Retired'
&gt;&gt;&gt; age = 35
&gt;&gt;&gt; y = 'Retired' if age &gt; 65 else 'Working'
&gt;&gt;&gt; y
'Working'
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>because True casts to 1 and False casts to 0 so if var = 70</p>

<pre><code>("Working","Retired")[var&gt;65]
</code></pre>

<p>becomes</p>

<pre><code>("Working", "Retired")[1]
</code></pre>

<p>a nice little shortcut ... but I find it can be a little confusing with anything but a simple condition, so I would go with TM's suggestion</p>

<pre><code>"Retired" if var &gt; 65 else "Working"
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><h3>indexing into a list</h3>

<p>The use of</p>

<pre><code>[expression_when_false, expression_when_true][condition] # or
(expression_when_false, expression_when_true)[condition]
</code></pre>

<p>takes advantage of the fact that in Python True equals (but isn't!) 1 and False equals (but isn't!) 0. The expression above constructs a list of two elements, and uses the result of <em>condition</em> to index in the list and return only one expression. The drawback of this method is that both expressions are evaluated.</p>

<h3>and-or shortcuts</h3>

<p>Since the creation of Python, there was a form of this operation:</p>

<pre><code>condition and expression_when_true or expression_when_false
</code></pre>

<p>This takes a shortcut and evaluates only one expression, but has a bug-prone drawback: the *expression_when_true* <strong>must not</strong> evaluate to a non-true value, otherwise the result is *expression_when_false*. <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> are "short-circuiting" in Python, and the following rules apply:</p>

<pre><code>a and b #→ a if a is false, else b
a or b  #→ a if a is true, else b
</code></pre>

<p>If <em>condition</em> is false, then *expression_when_true* is never evaluated and the result is *expression_when_false*. OTOH, if <em>condition</em> is true, then the result is the result of (*expression_when_true* or *expression_when_false*); consult the table above.</p>

<h3>ternary conditional operator</h3>

<p>Of course, since Python 2.5, there is a ternary conditional operator:</p>

<pre><code>expression_when_true if condition else expression_when_false
</code></pre>

<p>The strange (if you are accustomed to the C-like ternary conditional operator) order of the operands is attributed <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.5/whatsnew/pep-308.html" rel="nofollow">to many things</a>; the general intention is that <em>condition</em> should be true most of the time, so that the most common output comes first and is most visible.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>In Python 2.6 and up:</p>

<pre><code>print "You should be {0}.".format("retired" if var&gt;65 else "working")
</code></pre>

<p>In Python 3.1 and up:</p>

<pre><code>print ("You should be {}.".format("retired" if var&gt;65 else "working"))
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>in the code that you posted the following line is emulating ternary:</p>

<pre><code>status = ("Working","Retired")[var&gt;65]
</code></pre>

<p>here tuple <code>("Working","Retired")</code> accessed with an index <code>[var&gt;65]</code> which evaluates to either <code>True</code> (<code>1</code>) or <code>False</code> (<code>0</code>). When it's accessed with index <code>0</code>, <code>status</code> will be <code>'Working'</code>; if index is <code>1</code> then it'll be <code>`Retired'</code>. It's a fairly obscure way to do conditional assignment, use the normal ternary syntax that was introduced in py2.5 as was said.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>this is the form with the python ternary operator</p>

<pre><code>def val():
    var = float(raw_input("Age:"))
    status = "Retired" if var &gt; 65 else "Working"
    print "You should be:",status
</code></pre>

<p>the code you showed is a bit tricky: it creates a two elements tuple whose elements are at position 0 and 1. to select the right element it uses a condition which return a boolean but booleans in python are integers so you can use it as <em>special</em> indexes (they can be either 0 or 1).</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>There was originally no ternary operator because "Explicit is better than implicit", and it was seen as unpythonic. I don't like python's ternary op too much, either, but it exists:</p>

<pre><code>x = foo if condition else bar
</code></pre>

<p>as shown by TM.</p>

<p>As for <code>status = ("Working","Retired")[var&gt;65]</code>, 
<code>var &gt; 65</code> returns a boolean value: either True or False; however, Python treats boolean types quite weakly: <code>True</code> is <code>1</code> and <code>False</code> is <code>0</code> in some contexts. You can check it out by doing <code>&gt;&gt;&gt; True == 1</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><pre><code>status = ("Working","Retired")[var&gt;65]
</code></pre>

<p>This line works as a ternary operator because the expression <code>var&gt;65</code> returns 1 or 0, depending on whether <code>var</code> is bigger than 65 or not.  So if <code>var&gt;65</code>, then the line becomes this:</p>

<pre><code>status = ("Working","Retired")[1]
</code></pre>

<p>that is, the second element of the sequence <code>("Working","Retired")</code>.  It looks odd but not if you write it like this instead:</p>

<pre><code>status_sequence = ("Working","Retired")
status = status_sequence[1]
</code></pre>

<p>so <code>status = "Retired"</code>.</p>

<p>Similarly, if <code>var&lt;=65</code> then it becomes</p>

<pre><code>status = ("Working","Retired")[0]
</code></pre>

<p>and <code>status = "Working"</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>Only the "status =" line of that code implements something like the ternary operator.</p>

<pre><code>status = ("Working","Retired")[var&gt;65]
</code></pre>

<p>This creates a two-element tuple, with strings 'Working' at index 0, and 'Retired' at index 1.  Following this, it indexes into that tuple to pick one of the two items, using the results of the expression <code>var &gt; 65</code>.</p>

<p>This expression will return True (equivalent to 1, thus picking 'Retired') if the value of var is greater than 65.  Otherwise it will return False (equivalent to 0, thus picking 'Working').</p>

<p>There is a key difference between this approach and the ternary operator, however, although it doesn't matter in your particular example.  With the tuple-indexing approach, both values are evaluated but only one is returned.  With the ternary operator, only one of the two values is actually evaluated; this is referred to as "short-circuit" behaviour.  It can matter in cases like this:</p>

<pre><code>status = funcA() if var &gt; 65 else funcB()
status = (funcB(), funcA())[var &gt; 65]
</code></pre>

<p>In the first case, either funcA() is called <em>or</em> funcB() is called, but never both.  In the latter case, both are called first, and the results are stored in the tuple -- then only one is picked and the tuple is discarded.</p>

<p>This is especially important to understand if either funcA() or funcB() have "side-effects", meaning they change other data as they execute.</p>
<br /><b>#10</b><br /><p>trying to give a complete answer based on the answers given here.</p>

<p>the way you found (please don't use this one because it is not very readable):</p>

<pre><code>def val():
    var = float(raw_input("Age:"))
    status = ("Working","Retired")[var&gt;65]
    print "You should be:",status
</code></pre>

<p>using the python 2.5+ syntax:</p>

<pre><code>def val():
    var = float(raw_input("Age:"))
    status = "Working" if var&gt;65 else "Retired"
    print "You should be:",status
</code></pre>

<p>using the other common method still preferred by some people:</p>

<pre><code>def val():
    var = float(raw_input("Age:"))
    status = var&gt;65 and "Working" or "Retired"
    print "You should be:",status
</code></pre>

<p><del>i personally tend to use the last since the order of the operands is the same as the C ternary operator.</del></p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
found some problems with the last approach (thx Roberto Bonvallet).<br>
from wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>this code would break if op1 could be
  a "falsy" value (None, False, 0, an
  empty sequence or collection, …) as
  the expression would return op2
  (whether it was truthy or falsy)
  instead of the (falsy) op1</p>
</blockquote>

<p>so my final suggestion would be to <strong>use the 2.5+ ternary operator</strong> since it is simple, readable and offers short-circuit behavior.</p>
<br /><b>#11</b><br /><h2>Short-circuit boolean expressions</h2>

<p>There is also an option to short-circuit logical operations:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; (2+2 == 4) and "Yes" or "No"
'Yes'
&gt;&gt;&gt; (2+2 == 5) and "Yes" or "No"
'No'
</code></pre>

<p>In your example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; (int(raw_input("Age: ")) &gt; 65) and "Retired" or "Working"
Age: 20
'Working'
&gt;&gt;&gt; (int(raw_input("Age: ")) &gt; 65) and "Retired" or "Working"
Age: 70
'Retired'
</code></pre>
