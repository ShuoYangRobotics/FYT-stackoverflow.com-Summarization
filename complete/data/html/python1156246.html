<h3>Question (ID-1156246):</h3><h2>Having Django serve downloadable files</h2><p>I want users on the site to be able to download files whose paths are obscured so they cannot be directly downloaded.</p>

<p>For instance, I'd like the URL to be something like this, "http://example.com/download/?f=somefile.txt</p>

<p>And on the server, I know that all downloadable files reside in a folder "/home/user/files/".</p>

<p>Is there a way to make Django serve that file for download as opposed to trying to find a URL and View to display it?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>For the "best of both worlds" you could combine S.Lott's solution with the <a href="http://www.google.com.ng/search?q=mod%5Fxsendfile&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">xsendfile module</a>: django generates the path to the file (or the file itself), but the actual file serving is handled by Apache/Lighttpd. Once you've set up mod_xsendfile, integrating with your view takes a few lines of code:</p>

<pre><code>response = HttpResponse(mimetype='application/force-download')
response['Content-Disposition'] = 'attachment; filename=%s' % smart_str(file_name)
response['X-Sendfile'] = smart_str(path_to_file)
# It's usually a good idea to set the 'Content-Length' header too.
# You can also set any other required headers: Cache-Control, etc.
return response
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, this will only work if you have control over your server, or your hosting company has mod_xsendfile already set up.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>A "download" is simply an HTTP header change.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/request-response/#telling-the-browser-to-treat-the-response-as-a-file-attachment" rel="nofollow">http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/request-response/#telling-the-browser-to-treat-the-response-as-a-file-attachment</a> for how to respond with a download.</p>

<p>You only need one URL definition for <code>"/download"</code>.</p>

<p>The request's <code>GET</code> or <code>POST</code> dictionary will have the <code>"f=somefile.txt"</code> information.</p>

<p>Your view function will simply merge the base path with the "<code>f</code>" value, open the file, create and return a response object.  It should be less than 12 lines of code.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>S.Lott has the "good"/simple solution, and elo80ka has the "best"/efficient solution.  Here is a middle "better"/middle solution - no server setup, but more efficient for large files than the naive fix.</p>

<p><a href="http://djangosnippets.org/snippets/365/" rel="nofollow">http://djangosnippets.org/snippets/365/</a></p>

<p>Basically django still handles serving the file, but does not load the whole thing into memory at once.  This allows your server to (slowly) server a big file without ramping up the memory usage.</p>

<p>Again, S.Lott's X-SendFile is still better for larger files.  But if you can't or don't want to bother with that, then this middle solution will gain you better efficiency without the hassle.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>It was mentioned above that the mod_xsendfile method does not allow for non-ASCII characters in filenames.</p>

<p>For this reason, I have a patch available for mod_xsendfile that will allow any file to be sent, as long as the name is url encoded, and the additional header:</p>

<pre><code>X-SendFile-Encoding: url
</code></pre>

<p>Is sent as well.</p>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Django recommend that you use another server to serve static media (another server running on the same machine is fine.) They recommend the use of such servers as <a href="http://www.lighttpd.net/" rel="nofollow">lighttp</a>. </p>

<p>This is very simple to set up. However. if 'somefile.txt' is generated on request (content is dynamic) then you may want django to serve it.</p>

<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Another project to have a look at: <a href="http://readthedocs.org/docs/django-private-files/en/latest/usage.html" rel="nofollow">http://readthedocs.org/docs/django-private-files/en/latest/usage.html</a>
Looks promissing, haven't tested it myself yet tho.</p>

<p>Basically the project abstracts the mod_xsendfile configuration and allows you to do things like:</p>

<pre><code>from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from private_files import PrivateFileField

def is_owner(request, instance):
    return (not request.user.is_anonymous()) and request.user.is_authenticated and
                   instance.owner.pk = request.user.pk

class FileSubmission(models.Model):
    description = models.CharField("description", max_length = 200)
        owner = models.ForeignKey(User)
    uploaded_file = PrivateFileField("file", upload_to = 'uploads', condition = is_owner)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Is there any way to return a file and a redirect?  </p>

<p>Ideally:</p>

<p>1) The user would click a link</p>

<p>2) A dynamically generated file would download</p>

<p>3) The user would be redirected to another page</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
