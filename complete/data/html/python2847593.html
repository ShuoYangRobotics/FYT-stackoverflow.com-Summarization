<h3>Question (ID-2847593):</h3><h2>Stack recommendations for small/medium-sized web application in Python</h2><p>I'm looking for some recommendations for a python web application. We have some memory restrictions and we try to keep it small and lean.</p>

<p>We thought about using WSGI (and a python webserver) and build the rest ourself. We already have a template engine we'd like to use, but we are open for some suggestions regarding the whole request handling (the controller). </p>

<p>The application has to run in a single process and the requests have to be processed with multiple threads.</p>

<p>We've looked at django, but we are a not sure if it fits into our memory budget.</p>

<p>Your feedback is very welcome!</p>

<p>Cheers,
Reto</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You can run an django application in 20 mb memory easily. probably a django application will use less memory than 20mb. </p>

<p>I want to advise you to check webpy and cherrypy</p>

<p>but I'm big fan of django. if you have 20 mb memory to run application, django will give you everythig it has.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I'd go for <a href="http://bottle.paws.de/" rel="nofollow">bottle</a>. It has all the conciseness of web.py but with some nice routing features.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I've been using <a href="http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/" rel="nofollow">Werkzeug</a> because it's more a small collection of really useful components than a whole framework.  It runs behind a wsgi server of your choice (and comes with a built-in one).  If you want something even easier, <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/" rel="nofollow">Flask</a> might be worth a look.  Also, you might want to bookmark the rather speedy <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/2/" rel="nofollow">Jinja</a> in case your template engine doesn't pan out.  Those folks over at pocoo.org have been releasing some nice stuff.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You could take a look at <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/" rel="nofollow">Twisted</a>, which has a module twisted.web. That seems to be fairly light-weight. I'm currently using it, and with a simple app it starts almost instantaneously, so it can't be all that resource intensive :)</p>

<p>I don't know whether Twisted uses different threads.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>webpy (http://webpy.org/) is a very minimal memory footprint but highly usable framework. But it all depends on how complex your application is going to be. </p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Also please take a look at WHIFF.  It's tiny and very flexible <a href="http://whiffdoc.appspot.com" rel="nofollow">whiff documentation</a></p>
