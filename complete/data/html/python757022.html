<h3>Question (ID-757022):</h3><h2>How do you serialize a model instance in Django?</h2><p>There is a lot of documentation on how to serialize a Model QuerySet but how do you just serialize to json the fields of a Model Instance?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You can easily use a list to wrap the required object and that's all what django serializers need to correctly serialize it, eg.:</p>

<pre><code># assuming obj is a model instance
serialized_obj = serializers.serialize('json', [ obj, ])
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>It sounds like what you're asking about involves serializing the data structure of a Django model instance for interoperability.  The other posters are correct: if you wanted the serialized form to be used with a python application that can query the database via Django's api, then you would wan to serialize a queryset with one object.  If, on the other hand, what you need is a way to re-inflate the model instance somewhere else without touching the database or without using Django, then you have a little bit of work to do.</p>

<p>Here's what I do:</p>

<p>First, I use <a href="http://deron.meranda.us/python/demjson/" rel="nofollow"><code>demjson</code></a> for the conversion.  It happened to be what I found first, but it might not be the best.  My implementation depends on one of its features, but there should be similar ways with other converters.</p>

<p>Second, implement a <code>json_equivalent</code> method on all models that you might need serialized.  This is a magic method for <code>demjson</code>, but it's probably something you're going to want to think about no matter what implementation you choose.  The idea is that you return an object that is directly convertible to <code>json</code> (i.e. an array or dictionary).  If you really want to do this automatically:</p>

<pre><code>def json_equivalent(self):
    dictionary = {}
    for field in self._meta.get_all_field_names()
        dictionary[field] = self.__getattribute__(field)
    return dictionary
</code></pre>

<p>This will not be helpful to you unless you have a completely flat data structure (no <code>ForeignKeys</code>, only numbers and strings in the database, etc.).  Otherwise, you should seriously think about the right way to implement this method.</p>

<p>Third, call <code>demjson.JSON.encode(instance)</code> and you have what you want.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>What's wrong with serializing a QuerySet that has just a single model instance?</p>

<pre><code>data = serializers.serialize("xml", SomeModel.objects.get(pk=1))
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>It doesn't seem you can serialize an instance, you'd have to serialize a QuerySet of one object.</p>

<pre><code>from django.core import serializers
from models import *

def getUser(request):
    return HttpResponse(json(Users.objects.filter(id=88)))
</code></pre>

<p>I run out of the <code>svn</code> release of django, so this may not be in earlier versions.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><pre><code>ville = UneVille.objects.get(nom='lihlihlihlih')
....
blablablab
.......

return HttpResponse(simplejson.dumps(ville.__dict__))
</code></pre>

<p>I return the dict of my instance</p>

<p>so it return something like {'field1':value,"field2":value,....}</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>how about this way:</p>

<pre><code>def ins2dic(obj):
    SubDic = obj.__dict__
    del SubDic['id']
    del SubDic['_state']
return SubDic
</code></pre>

<p>or exclude anything you don't want.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I solved this problem by adding a serialization method to my model:</p>

<pre><code>def toJSON(self):
    import simplejson
    return simplejson.dumps(dict([(attr, getattr(self, attr)) for attr in [f.name for f in self._meta.fields]]))
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the verbose equivalent for those averse to one-liners:</p>

<pre><code>def toJSON(self):
    fields = []
    for field in self._meta.fields:
        fields.append(field.name)

    d = {}
    for attr in fields:
        d[attr] = getattr(self, attr)

    import simplejson
    return simplejson.dumps(d)
</code></pre>

<p><code>_meta.fields</code> is an ordered list of model fields which can be accessed from instances and from the model itself.</p>
