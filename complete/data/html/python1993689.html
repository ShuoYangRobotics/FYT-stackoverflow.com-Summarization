<h3>Question (ID-1993689):</h3><h2>Learning Python and using dictionaries</h2><p>I'm working through exercises in <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/s_lott/books/python/html/p02/p02c05_maps.html" rel="nofollow">Building Skills in Python</a>, which to my knowledge don't have any published solutions.</p>

<p>In any case, I'm attempting to have a dictionary count the number of occurrences of a certain number in the original list, before duplicates are removed.  For some reason, despite a number of variations on the theme below, I cant seem to increment the value for each of the 'keys' in the dictionary.</p>

<p>How could I code this with dictionaries?</p>

<pre><code>dv = list()
# arbitrary sequence of numbers
seq = [2,4,5,2,4,6,3,8,9,3,7,2,47,2]

# dictionary counting number of occurances
seqDic = { }

for v in seq:
    i = 1
    dv.append(v)
    for i in range(len(dv)-1):
        if dv[i] == v:
            del dv[-1]
            seqDic.setdefault(v)
            currentCount = seqDic[v]
            currentCount += 1
            print currentCount # debug
            seqDic[v]=currentCount
print "orig:", seq
print "new: ", dv
print seqDic

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from collections import defaultdict

&gt;&gt;&gt; seq = [2,4,5,2,4,6,3,8,9,3,7,2,47,2]

&gt;&gt;&gt; seqDic = defaultdict(int)

&gt;&gt;&gt; for v in seq:
...     seqDic[v] += 1

&gt;&gt;&gt; print seqDic
defaultdict(&lt;type 'int'&gt;, {2: 4, 3: 2, 4: 2, 5: 1, 6: 1, 7: 1, 8: 1, 9: 1, 47: 1})

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I'm not really sure what you try to do .. count how often each number appears?</p>

<pre><code>#arbitrary sequence of numbers
seq = [2,4,5,2,4,6,3,8,9,3,7,2,47,2]

#dictionary counting number of occurances
seqDic = {}

### what you want to do, spelled out
for number in seq:
    if number in seqDic: # we had the number before
        seqDic[number] += 1
    else: # first time we see it
        seqDic[number] = 1

#### or:
for number in seq:
    current = seqDic.get(number, 0) # current count in the dict, or 0
    seqDic[number] = current + 1

### or, to show you how setdefault works
for number in seq:
    seqDic.setdefault(number, 0) # set to 0 if it doesnt exist
    seqDic[number] += 1 # increase by one

print "orig:", seq
print seqDic

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><code>defaultdict</code> is not <code>dict</code> (it's a subclass, and may do too much of the work for you to help you learn via this exercise), so here's a simple way to do it with plain <code>dict</code>:</p>

<pre><code>dv = list()
# arbitrary sequence of numbers
seq = [2,4,5,2,4,6,3,8,9,3,7,2,47,2]

# dictionary counting number of occurances
seqDic = { }

for i in seq:
  if i in seqDic:
    seqDic[i] += 1
  else:
    dv.append(i)
    seqDic[i] = 1
</code></pre>

<p>this simple approach works particularly well here because you need the <code>if i in seqDic</code> test anyway for the purpose of building <code>dv</code> as well as <code>seqDic</code>.  Otherwise, simpler would be:</p>

<pre><code>for i in seq:
  seqDic[i] = 1 + seqDic.get(i, 0)
</code></pre>

<p>using the handy method <code>get</code> of <code>dict</code>, which returns the second argument if the first is not a key in the dictionary.  If you like this idea, here's a solution that <em>also</em> builds <code>dv</code>:</p>

<pre><code>for i in seq:
  seqDic[i] = 1 + seqDic.get(i, 0)
  if seqDic[i] == 1: dv.append(i)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: If you don't case about the order of items in <code>dv</code> (rather than wanting <code>dv</code> to be in the same order as the first occurrence of item in <code>seq</code>), then just using (after the simple version of the loop)</p>

<pre><code>dv = seqDic.keys()
</code></pre>

<p>also works (in Python 2, where <code>.keys</code> returns a list), and so does</p>

<pre><code>dv = list(seqDic)
</code></pre>

<p>which is fine in both Python 2 <strong>and</strong> Python 3.  Under the same hypothesis (that you don't care about the order of items in <code>dv</code>) there are also other good solutions, such as</p>

<pre><code>seqDic = dict.fromkeys(seq, 0)
for i in seq: seqDic[i] += 1
dv = list(seqDic)
</code></pre>

<p>here, we first use the <code>fromkeys</code> class method of dictionaries to build a new dict which already has <code>0</code> as the value corresponding to each key, so we can then just increment each entry without such precautions as <code>.get</code> or membership checks.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>How about this:</p>

<pre><code>#arbitrary sequence of numbers
seq = [2,4,5,2,4,6,3,8,9,3,7,2,47,2]

#dictionary counting number of occurances
seqDic = { }

for v in seq:
    if v in seqDic:
        seqDic[v] += 1
    else:
        seqDic[v] = 1

dv = seqDic.keys()

print "orig:", seq
print "new: ", dv
print seqDic
</code></pre>

<p>It's clean and I think it demonstrates what you are trying to learn how to do in a simple manner. It is possible to do this using defaultdict as others have pointed out, but knowing how to do it this way is instructive too.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Or, if you use Python3, you can use <code>collections.Counter</code>, which is essentially a <code>dict</code>, albeit subclassed.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from collections import Counter
&gt;&gt;&gt; seq = [2,4,5,2,4,6,3,8,9,3,7,2,47,2]
&gt;&gt;&gt; Counter(seq)
Counter({2: 4, 3: 2, 4: 2, 5: 1, 6: 1, 7: 1, 8: 1, 9: 1, 47: 1}
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><pre><code>for v in seq:
    try:
        seqDic[v] += 1
    except KeyError:
        seqDic[v] = 1
</code></pre>

<p>That's the way I've always done the inner loop of things like this.</p>

<p>Apart from anything else, it's significantly faster than testing membership before working on the element, so if you have a few hundred thousand elements it saves a lot of time.</p>
