<h3>Question (ID-1780922):</h3><h2>How do I encode a 4-byte string as a single 32-bit integer?</h2><p>First, a disclaimer. I'm not a CS grad nor a math major, so simplicity is important. </p>

<p>I have a four-character string (e.g. "isoy") that I need to pass as a single 32-bit integer field. Of course at the other end, I need to decode it back to a string. The string will only contain A-Z, and case is not important, if that helps.</p>

<p>The funny part is that I'm starting with PowerShell on the sending end and Linux at the receiving end. I can use Perl or Python there, with a preference for Python. I don't actually need answers in each language, I'm most interested in a PowerShell (C# also good) example for going both ways.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>For Python, <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/struct.html?highlight=struct.pack#struct.pack" rel="nofollow">struct.unpack</a> does the job (to make a 4-byte string into an int -- <code>struct.pack</code> goes the other way):</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import struct
&gt;&gt;&gt; struct.unpack('i', 'isoy')[0]
2037347177
&gt;&gt;&gt; struct.pack('i', 2037347177)
'isoy'
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>(you can use different formats to ensure big-endian or little-endian encoding, if you need that -- <code>'&gt;i'</code> and <code>'&lt;i'</code> respectively -- instead of just plain <code>'i'</code> which uses whatever encoding is native to the machine).</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>To 32-bit unsigned integer:</p>

<pre><code>uint x = BitConverter.ToUInt32(Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes("isoy"), 0); // 2037347177
</code></pre>

<p>To string:</p>

<pre><code>string s = Encoding.ASCII.GetString(BitConverter.GetBytes(x));      // "isoy"
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.bitconverter.aspx" rel="nofollow">BitConverter</a> uses the native endianness of the machine.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Using PowerShell syntax you can do it this way (pretty much like dtb solution):</p>

<pre><code>PS&gt; $x = [BitConverter]::ToUInt32([byte[]][char[]]'isoy', 0)
PS&gt; [char[]][BitConverter]::GetBytes($x) -join ''
isoy
</code></pre>

<p>You do have to watch out for endian-ness on the Linux side.  If it is running on an Intel processor I believe should be fine (same endian-ness as the PowerShell side).</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><pre><code>// string -&gt; int    

uint ret = 0;
for ( int i = 0; i &lt; 4; ++i )
{
  ret |= ( str[i] &lt;&lt; ( i * 8 ) );
}

// int -&gt; string
for ( int i = 0; i &lt; 4; ++i )
{
  str[i] = ( ret &gt;&gt; ( i * 8 ) ) &amp; 0xff;
}
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Please take a look at the struct standard library module in Python's Manual. It has two functions for this: <code>struct.pack</code> and <code>struct.unpack</code>. You can use the 'L' (unsigned long) format character for this.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Aside from byte packing, you can also consider that your 26-character alphabet can be encoded as 0-25 instead of A-Z.</p>

<p>So without worrying about big and little endians, you can go from "letters" to a number like this:</p>

<pre><code>val=letter0+letter1*26+letter2*26*26+letter3*26*26*26;
</code></pre>

<p>to go from val back to letters, you do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>letter0=val%26;
letter1=(val/26)%26;
letter2=(val/(26*26))%26;
letter3=(val/(26*26*26))%26;
</code></pre>

<p>where "%" is your language's modulus operator and "/" is an integer division.</p>

<p>You'll obviously need a way to get from 'A'-'Z' to 0-25 and back. That's language dependent.</p>

<p>You can easily put this into loops. I show the loops unrolled to make things a bit more obvious.</p>

<p>It's more common to pack letters into bytes, so you can use <strong>shift</strong> and <strong>and</strong> bitwise operations to encode and decode. But by doing it the way I show above, you could pack <strong>six</strong> letters into a 32-bit number, rather than just four. Which is nice, since you can hold things like stock market ticker symbols in a single 32-bit value (mutual funds ticker symbols are 5 characters).</p>
