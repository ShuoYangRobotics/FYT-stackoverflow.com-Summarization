<h3>Question (ID-677811):</h3><h2>Python and MySQL: is there an alternative to MySQLdb?</h2><p>Is there a module written purely in Python that will allow a script to communicate with a MySQL database? I've already tried MySQLdb without success. It requires too much: GCC, zlib, and openssl. I do not have access to these tools; even if I did, I don't want to waste time getting them to work together. I'm looking for tools that will make my work easier.</p>

<p>Can someone point me in the direction of a MySQL Python module written in Python? If not, tips on writing my own code for communicating with MySQL would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Tony</p>

<p>I haven't found any code for it though. But according to a <a href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2009/1/8/the-sad-state-of-mysql-python#comment-864" rel="nofollow">blog comment</a>, it's more than vaporware.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Lately there is also <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/oursql/" rel="nofollow">oursql</a> (<a href="http://packages.python.org/oursql/" rel="nofollow">docs</a>), which has various advantages over MySQLdb and other existing drivers -- listed at the top of the documentation.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You can find pre-built binary packages for MySQLdb and its dependencies for most operating systems.</p>

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Thanks everyone for your answers. Since I'm working with a small database (a few hundred records, mainly names and addresses) I've decided to use SQLite. I just discovered it. It seems to be perfectly suited for my purposes; it was simple to install (took about two minutes) and works well with Python. I'm stuck with Python 2.4 so I can't use the sqlite3 module, but I'm able to communicate with the database by using Python's 'subprocess.Popen' function and command-line parameters.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Without a doubt MySQLdb is the best solution, but if you can't use itâ€¦</p>

<p>If you have <code>libmysqlclient</code>.[<code>so</code>|<code>dll</code>], you could access it directly using <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/ctypes.html" rel="nofollow">ctypes</a> module. </p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>As mentioned in earlier answer, MySQL Connector/Python implements the MySQL Server/Client completely in Python. No compiling, just installing.</p>

<p>It's not complete yet, but it should have enough to keep you going.

<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>As far as I know there is no direct alternative.  The only thing I can think of is to use ODBC instead, via <a href="http://pyodbc.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">pyodbc</a>.  The MySQL site has an ODBC connector you can <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/odbc/5.1.html" rel="nofollow">download</a>.  But I've never used this approach myself, so I can't say how well it will work.</p>
