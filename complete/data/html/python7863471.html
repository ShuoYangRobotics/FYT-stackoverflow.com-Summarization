<h3>Question (ID-7863471):</h3><h2>Rock Paper Scissors in Python</h2><p>I am trying to write a Python program and I am having a hard time getting my score. I have written it as a value returning function and every time I run the program it seems to skip the step where it retrieves the score unless I include an else statement which it will automatcially jump the the else statement.
I will attach the full code below.
Thank you very much for any help, I'm greatful!
This is also my first time posting in this forum I apologize if I screw something up. </p>

<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>There's so much wrong with this, it's hard to know where to start (but don't get discouraged)... </p>

<p>First of all, it looks like (mostly from your use of <code>input</code> vs. <code>raw_input</code> and your parens with your print statements) you're using Python 3, which already is going to limit the amount of help you get.  Most people are still using Python 2.6 or 2.7.  But with that out of the way...</p>

<p>The main remaining issues addressing your question are:</p>

<p>First: you're using strings for player input (e.g. '1', '2', '3'), and numbers for computer choice (e.g. 1, 2, 3).  So you need to compare them as such.  In other words, instead of:</p>

<pre><code>if computer == 1 and play == 2:
</code></pre>

<p>You would need to say:</p>

<pre><code>if computer == 1 and play == '2':
</code></pre>

<p>Second: you're trying to reference one function's variables in another one, and that won't work.  If you want your <code>computer_wins</code>, etc. variables to be global, you need to initialize them at the global scope, e.g. right after your "#constants" are declared and before you get into <code>main</code>.  Then in any function that uses them, you must say e.g. <code>global computer_wins</code> to indicate they are global and not local.</p>

<p>Once you get these issues addressed, it should work a bit better, but you'll still need to do a lot of cleanup and keep working on it!  </p>

<p>Keep at it, and soon it will be natural for you.</p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>A couple quick notes from quickly skimming the code:</p>

<p>In <code>get_score()</code> you could add an else clause to handle any ties that happen and you wouldn't have to check for it explicitly in <code>play_game()</code></p>

<p>Move the <code>import random</code> to the top of the file. imports are generally always found at the top of the file. Also, there's no need to re-import every time you want a random number.</p>

<p>Not sure if this is a typo, cause <code>play</code> seems to always hold an integer, but you have <code>play == True</code> and <code>play == False</code> inside <code>play_game()</code>. If you want to make <code>play</code> contain either <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>, you need to be using a single equals sign, eg, <code>play = True</code>. But this doesn't seem to make sense because you're comparing <code>play</code> to <code>computer</code> as if they're integers.</p>

<p>Also, what are you trying to accomplish with the <code>score</code> variable in the <code>get_score()</code> method?</p>

<p>Ah, if you made the <code>get_score()</code> method return something so you know who won the match it would be helpful. You can't access <code>computer_wins</code> or <code>player_wins</code> inside the <code>get_score()</code> method because they were defined inside <code>main()</code>. A simple way to do this is return an int from <code>get_score()</code>. here is a rather C-style way of handling it (returning -1/0/1). something like (pseudo code):</p>

<pre><code>def get_score():
  score = 0
  if computer wins:
      score = -1
  elif player wins:
      score = 1

  return score


winner = get_score()
if winner == 0:
    print 'tie game'
elif winner == 1
    print 'the player won'
else:
    print 'the computer won'
