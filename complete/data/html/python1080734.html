<h3>Question (ID-1080734):</h3><h2>Changes to Python since Dive into Python</h2><p>I've been teaching myself Python by working through <a href="http://www.diveintopython.net/" rel="nofollow">Dive Into Python</a> by Mark Pilgrim. I thoroughly recommend it, as do <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34570/what-is-the-best-quick-read-python-book-out-there/34608#34608">other Stack Overflow users</a>.</p>

<p>However, the last update to Dive Into Python was five years ago. I look forward to reading the new <a href="http://diveintopython3.net/" rel="nofollow">Dive into Python 3</a> When I make the switch to 3.x, but for now, using django means I'll stick to 2.x.</p>

<p>I'm interested to know what new features of Python I'm missing out on, if I've used Dive Into Python as my primary resource for learning the language. A couple of examples that I've come across are</p>

<ul>
<li>itertools</li>
<li>ElementTree</li>
</ul>

<p>Is there anything else I'm missing out on?</p>

<p>edit: As Bastien points out in his answer, I could just read the <a href="http://docs.python.org/whatsnew/" rel="nofollow">What's New in Python</a> pages, but sometimes it's fun to discover a useful tip on Stack Overflow rather than struggle through the complete, comprehensive answer in the official documentation.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Check out <a href="http://docs.python.org/whatsnew/" rel="nofollow">What's New in Python</a>. It has all the versions in the 2.x series. Per Alex's comments, you'll want to look at all Python 2.x for x > 2.</p>

<p>Highlights for day-to-day coding:</p>

<p><em>Enumeration</em>: Instead of doing:</p>

<pre><code>for i in xrange(len(sequence)):
    val = sequence[i]
    pass
</code></pre>

<p>You can now more succinctly write:</p>

<pre><code>for i, val in enumerate(iterable):
    pass
</code></pre>

<p>This is important because it works for non-getitemable iterables (you would otherwise have to use an incrementing index counter alongside value iteration).</p>

<p><em>Logging</em>: a sane alternative to print-based debugging, standardized in a Log4j-style library module.</p>

<p><em>Booleans</em>: True and False, added for clarity: <code>return True</code> clearer intention than <code>return 1</code>.</p>

<p><em>Generators</em>: An expressive form of lazy evaluation</p>

<pre><code>evens = (i for i in xrange(limit) if i % 2 == 0)
</code></pre>

<p><em>Extended slices</em>: Builtins support strides in slices.</p>

<pre><code>assert [1, 2, 3, 4][::2] == [1, 3]
</code></pre>

<p><em>Sets</em>: For O(1) lookup semantics, you no longer have to do:</p>

<pre><code>pseudo_set = {'foo': None, 'bar': None}
assert 'foo' in pseudo_set
</code></pre>

<p>You can now do:</p>

<pre><code>set_ = set(['foo', 'bar'])
assert 'foo' in set_
</code></pre>

<p><em>Reverse iteration</em>: <code>reversed(sequence)</code> is more readable than <code>sequence[::-1]</code>.</p>

<p><em>Subprocess</em>: Unifies all the ways you might want to invoke a subprocess -- capturing outputs, feeding input, blocking or non-blocking.</p>

<p><em>Conditional expressions</em>: There's an issue with the idiom:</p>

<pre><code>a and b or c
</code></pre>

<p>Namely, when b is falsy. <code>b if a else c</code> resolves that issue.</p>

<p><em>Context management</em>: Resource acquisition/release simplified via the <code>with</code> statement.</p>

<pre><code>with open(filename) as file:
    print file.read()
# File is closed outside the `with` block.
</code></pre>

<p><em>Better string formatting</em>: Too much to describe -- see Python documentation under <code>str.format()</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Mark(author of the book) had <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/8miar/im%5Fnew%5Fto%5Fpython%5Fshould%5Fi%5Fread%5Fdive%5Finto%5Fpython%5F3/c09s45y" rel="nofollow">some comments</a> on this. I've shamelessly copied the related paragraph here:<br />
"""If you choose Python 2, I can only recommend "Dive Into Python" chapters 2-7, 13-15, and 17. The rest of the book is horribly out of date."""</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Here's a couple of examples of the sort of answer I was thinking of:</p>

<h3>Conditional Expressions</h3>

<p>Instead of the <a href="http://www.diveintopython.net/power_of_introspection/and_or.html#d0e9975" rel="nofollow">and-or trick</a>, 2.5 offers a new way to write <a href="http://docs.python.org/whatsnew/2.5.html?highlight=with_statement#pep-308-conditional-expressions" rel="nofollow">conditional expressions</a>.</p>

<pre><code>#and-or trick:
x = condition and 'true_value' or 'false_value'

#new in 2.5:
x = 'true_value' if condition else 'false_value'
</code></pre>

<h3>Testing for keys in dictionaries</h3>

<p>has_key() <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=has_key#dict.has_key" rel="nofollow">is deprecated</a> in favor of key in d.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;d={'key':'value','key2':'value2'}
&gt;&gt;&gt;'key1' in d
 True
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>A few "minor" features were added in 2.4 and are pervasive in new 2.x python code: decorator (2.4) and try/except/finally clauses. Before you could not do:</p>

<pre><code>try:
    do_something()
except FunkyException:
    handle_exception():
finally:
    clean_up()
</code></pre>

<p>Both are essentially syntactic sugar, though, since you could do the same, just with a bit more code.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><pre><code>import antigravity
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/python.png" rel="nofollow">See the documentation</a></p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I suggest that you read the “what's in Python 2.x?” documents.
Some things that may have missed:</p>

<ul>
<li>New-style classes (allows standard types subtyping, properties, ...).</li>
<li>The <code>with</code> keyword, which helps allocating and releasing resources.</li>
</ul>
