<h3>Question (ID-867936):</h3><h2>Python: Elegant way of dual/multiple iteration over the same list</h2><p>I've written a bit of code like the following to compare items with other items further on in a list.  Is there a more elegant pattern for this sort of dual iteration?</p>

<pre><code>jump_item_iter = (j for j in items if some_cond)
try:
    jump_item = jump_item_iter.next()
except StopIteration:
    return
for item in items:
    if jump_item is item:
        try:
            jump_item = jump_iter.next()
        except StopIteration:
            return
    # do lots of stuff with item and jump_item
</code></pre>

<p>I don't think the "<code>except StopIteration</code>" is very elegant</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>To hopefully make it clearer, I want to visit each item in a list and pair it with the next item further on in the list (jump_item) which satisfies some_cond.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-17):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>As far as I can see any of the existing solutions work on a general one shot, possiboly infinite iter**ator**, all of them seem to require an iter**able**.</p>

<p>Heres a solution to that.</p>

<pre><code>def batch_by(condition, seq):
    it = iter(seq)
    batch = [it.next()]
    for jump_item in it:
        if condition(jump_item):
            for item in batch:
                yield item, jump_item
            batch = []
        batch.append(jump_item)
</code></pre>

<p>This will easily work on infinite iterators:</p>

<pre><code>from itertools import count, islice
is_prime = lambda n: n == 2 or all(n % div for div in xrange(2,n))
print list(islice(batch_by(is_prime, count()), 100))
</code></pre>

<p>This will print first 100 integers with the prime number that follows them.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I have no idea what <code>compare()</code> is doing, but 80% of the time, you can do this with a trivial dictionary or pair of dictionaries.  Jumping around in a list is a kind of linear search. Linear Search -- to the extent possible -- should always be replaced with either a direct reference (i.e., a dict) or a tree search (using the bisect module).</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>How about this?</p>

<pre><code>paired_values = []
for elmt in reversed(items):
    if &lt;condition&gt;:
        current_val = elmt
    try:
        paired_values.append(current_val)
    except NameError:  # for the last elements of items that don't pass the condition
        pass
paired_values.reverse()

for (item, jump_item) in zip(items, paired_values):  # zip() truncates to len(paired_values)
    # do lots of stuff
</code></pre>

<p>If the first element of items matches, then it is used as a jump_item.  This is the only difference with your original code (and you might want this behavior).</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The following iterator is time and memory-efficient:</p>

<pre><code>def jump_items(items):
    number_to_be_returned = 0
    for elmt in items:
        if &lt;condition(elmt)&gt;:
            for i in range(number_to_be_returned):
                yield elmt
            number_to_be_returned = 1
        else:
            number_to_be_returned += 1

for (item, jump_item) in zip(items, jump_items(items)):
    # do lots of stuff
</code></pre>

<p>Note that you may actually want to set the first number_to_be_returned to 1...</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Write a generator function:</p>

<pre><code>def myIterator(someValue):
    yield (someValue[0], someValue[1])

for element1, element2 in myIterator(array):
     # do something with those elements.
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I have no idea what you're trying to do with that code. But I'm 99% certain that whatever it is could probably be done in 2 lines. I also get the feeling that the '==' operator should be an 'is' operator, otherwise what is the compare() function doing? And what happens if the item returned from the second jump_iter.next call also equals 'item'? It seems like the algorithm would do the wrong thing since you'll compare the second and not the first.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>You could put the whole iteration into a single try structure, that way it would be clearer:</p>

<pre><code>jump_item_iter = (j for j in items if some_cond)
try:
    jump_item = jump_item_iter.next()
    for item in items:
        if jump_item is item:
            jump_item = jump_iter.next()

    # do lots of stuff with item and jump_item

 except StopIteration:
     pass
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>So you want to compare pairs of items in the same list, the second item of the pair having to meet some condition. Normally, when you want to compare pairs in a list use <code>zip</code> (or <code>itertools.izip</code>):</p>

<pre><code>for item1, item2 in zip(items, items[1:]):
    compare(item1, item2)
</code></pre>

<p>Figure out how to fit your <code>some_cond</code> in this :)</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>Are you basically trying to compare every item in the iterator with every other item in the original list?</p>

<p>To my mind this should just be a case of using two loops, rather than trying to fit it into one.</p>

<pre>
<code>
filtered_items = (j for j in items if some_cond)
for filtered in filtered_items:
    for item in items:
        if filtered != item:
            compare(filtered, item)
</code>
</pre>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>Here is one simple solution that might look a little cleaner: </p>

<pre><code>for i, item in enumerate(items):
    for next_item in items[i+1:]:
        if some_cond(next_item):
            break
    # do some stuff with both items
</code></pre>

<p>The disadvantage is that you check the condition for next_item multiple times. But you can easily optimize this:</p>

<pre><code>cond_items = [item if some_cond(item) else None for item in items]
for i, item in enumerate(items):
    for next_item in cond_items[i+1:]:
        if next_item is not None:
            break
    # do some stuff with both items
</code></pre>

<p>However, both solutions carry more overhead than the original solution from the question. And when you start using counters to work around this then I think it is better to use the iterator interface directly (as in the original solution).</p>
<br /><b>#10</b><br /><p>My first answer was wrong because I didn't quite understand what you were trying to achieve.  So if I understand correctly (this time, I hope), you want the main <code>for item in items:</code> to "chase" after an iterator that filters out some items. Well, there's not much you can do, except maybe wrap this into a <code>chase_iterator(iterable, some_cond)</code> generator, which would make your main code a little more readable.</p>

<p>Maybe that a more readable approach would be an "accumulator approach" (if the order of the compare() don't matter), like:</p>

<pre><code>others = []
for item in items:
    if some_cond(item):
        for other in others:
            compare(item, other)
        others = []
    else:
        others.append(item)
</code></pre>

<p>(man, I'm beginning to hate Stack Overflow... too addictive...)</p>
<br /><b>#11</b><br /><pre><code>for i in range( 0, len( items ) ):
    for j in range( i+1, len( items ) ):
        if some_cond:
            #do something
            #items[i] = item, items[j] = jump_item
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#12</b><br /><p>With just iterators</p>

<pre><code>def(lst, some_cond):
      jump_item_iter = (j for j in lst if som_cond(j))
      pairs = itertools.izip(lst, lst[1:])
      for last in jump_item_iter:
        for start, start_next in itertools.takewhile(lambda pair: pair[0] &lt; last, pairs):
          yield start, last
        pairs = itertools.chain([(start_next, 'dummy')], pairs)
</code></pre>

<p>with the input: range(10) and some_cond = lambda x : x % 2
gives [(0, 1), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 7), (6, 7), (7, 9), (8, 9)]
(same that your example)</p>
<br /><b>#13</b><br /><p>Even better using itertools.groupby:</p>

<pre><code>def h(lst, cond):
  remain = lst
  for last in (l for l in lst if cond(l)):
    group = itertools.groupby(remain, key=lambda x: x &lt; last)
    for start in group.next()[1]:
      yield start, last
    remain = list(group.next()[1])
</code></pre>

<p>Usage:
lst = range(10)
cond = lambda x: x%2
print list(h(lst, cond))</p>

<p>will print </p>

<pre><code>[(0, 1), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 7), (6, 7), (7, 9), (8, 9)]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#14</b><br /><p>Maybe it is too late, but what about:</p>

<pre><code>l = [j for j in items if some_cond]
for item, jump_item in zip(l, l[1:]):
    # do lots of stuff with item and jump_item
</code></pre>

<p>If l = [j for j in range(10) if j%2 ==0] then the iteration is over: [(0, 2),(2, 4),(4, 6),(6, 8)].</p>
<br /><b>#15</b><br /><p>You could write your loop body as:</p>

<pre><code>import itertools, functools, operator

for item in items:
    jump_item_iter = itertools.dropwhile(functools.partial(operator.is_, item), 
                                         jump_item_iter)

    # do something with item and jump_item_iter
</code></pre>

<p>dropwhile will return an iterator that skips over all those which match the condition (here "<code>is item</code>").</p>
<br /><b>#16</b><br /><p>You could do something like:</p>

<pre><code>import itertools

def matcher(iterable, compare):
    iterator= iter(iterable)
    while True:
        try: item= iterator.next()
        except StopIteration: break
        iterator, iterator2= itertools.tee(iterator)
        for item2 in iterator2:
            if compare(item, item2):
                yield item, item2
</code></pre>

<p>but it's quite elaborate (and actually not very efficient), and it would be simpler if you just did a</p>

<pre><code>items= list(iterable)
</code></pre>

<p>and then just write two loops over <code>items</code>.</p>

<p>Obviously, this won't work with infinite iterables, but your specification can only work on finite iterables.</p>
