<h3>Question (ID-1100924):</h3><h2>Best way to denormalize data in Django?</h2><p>I'm developing a simple web app, and it makes a lot of sense to store some denormalized data. </p>

<p>Imagine a blogging platform that keeps track of Comments, and the BlogEntry model has a "CommentCount" field that I'd like to keep up to date.</p>

<p>One way of doing this would be to use Django signals. </p>

<p>Another way of doing this would be to put hooks directly in my code that creates and destrys Comment objects to synchronously call some methods on BlogEntry to increment/decrement the comment count. </p>

<p>I suppose there are other pythonic ways of accomplishing this with decorators or some other voodoo.  </p>

<p>What is the standard Design Pattern for denormalizing in Django?  In practice, do you also have to write consistency checkers and data fixers in case of errors?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You have managers in Django.</p>

<p>Use a customized manager to do creates and maintain the FK relationships.</p>

<p>The manager can update the counts as the sets of children are updated.</p>

<p>If you don't want to make customized managers, just extend the <code>save</code> method.  Everything you want to do for denormalizing counts and sums can be done in <code>save</code>.</p>

<p>You don't need signals.  Just extend <code>save</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I found <a href="http://github.com/initcrash/django-denorm" rel="nofollow">django-denorm</a> to be useful. It uses database-level triggers instead of signals, but as far as I know, there is also branch based on different approach.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>definitely use <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/signals/#topics-signals" rel="nofollow">signals</a></p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The first approach (signals) has the advantage to loose the coupling between models.<br />
However, signals are somehow more difficult to maintain, because dependencies are less explicit (at least, in my opinion).<br />
If the correctness of the comment count is not so important, you could also think of a cron job that will update it every <em>n</em> minutes.</p>

<p>However, no matter the solution, <strong>denormalizing will make maintenance more difficult</strong>; for this reason I would try to <strong>avoid it</strong> as much as possible, resolving instead to using caches or other techniques -- for example, using <code>with comments.count as cnt</code> in templates may improve performance quite a lot.<br />
Then, if everything else fails, and only in that case, think about what could be the best approach for the specific problem.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Django offers a great and efficient (though not very known) alternative to <strong>counter denormalization</strong>.</p>

<p>It will save your many lines of code and it's really slow since you retrieve the count in the same SQL query.</p>

<p>I will suppose you have these classes:</p>

<pre><code>class BlogEntry(models.Model):
     title = models.CharField()
     ...


class Comment(models.Model):
     body = models.TextField()
     blog_entry = models.ForeignKey(BlogEntry)
</code></pre>

<p>In your views.py, use <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/aggregation/#generating-aggregates-for-each-item-in-a-queryset" rel="nofollow">annotations</a>:</p>

<pre><code>from django.db.models import Count

def blog_entry_list(Request):
    blog_entries = BlogEntry.objects.annotate(count=Count('comment_set')).all()
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>And you will have an extra field per each BlogEntry, that contains the count of comments, plus the rest of fields of BlobEntry.</p>

<p>You can use this extra field in the templates too:</p>

<pre><code>{% for blog_entry in blog_entries %}
  {{ blog_entry.title }} has {{ blob_entry.count }} comments!
{% endfor %}
</code></pre>

<p>This will not only save you coding and maintenance time but it is really efficient (the query takes only a bit longer to be executed).</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Why not just get the set of comments, and find the number of elements, using the <code>count()</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>count = blog_entry.comment_set.count()
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can pass that into your template.</p>

<p>Or, alternative, in the template itself, you can do:</p>

<pre><code>{{ blog_entry.comment_set.count }}
</code></pre>

<p>to get the number of comments.</p>
