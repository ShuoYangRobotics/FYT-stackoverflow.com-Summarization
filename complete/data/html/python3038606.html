<h3>Question (ID-3038606):</h3><h2>Easy ways to investigate unknown Python APIs</h2><p>When studying a snippet of unknown Python code, I occasionally bump into the</p>

<pre><code>varName.methodName()
</code></pre>

<p>pattern.</p>

<p>To figure out what's this, I shall study the code more, find where varName was instantiated, find its type. So if <strong>varName</strong> proves to be an instance of <strong>ClassName</strong> class, I would knew that <strong>methodName()</strong> is a method of <strong>ClassName</strong>.</p>

<p>Sometimes <strong>varName</strong> == <strong>self</strong> and <strong>methodName()</strong> is a method of this class, or a method inherited from some other class, if the current class is subclassing some other classes.</p>

<p>Are there quick ways / tools that could take 'methodName' as input, scan over all installed Python modules and show which classes have <strong>methodName()</strong>?</p>

<p>The closest thing related to this I know of is ipython. If I type a class name, then dot ('.') then TAB, it can show the class members. Instead of a class I could use a name of an object (which is an instance of a certain class) and it would work too. As soon as I choose a method name from the provided options, I can type '?' or '??' and get some help if there's a docstring.</p>

<p>I wonder if ipython can do some intelligent scanning based only on 'methodName' string.</p>

<p>If you know alternatives to ipython that could possibly help with this, please do suggest them.</p>

<p>Edit: as requested, I'm explicitly adding that I would like a way to find methods by method names <strong>not only</strong> in Python source code files. Some Python packages (notably PyQt) contain a lot of .so files, and ipython is able to do completions by presumably importing them first. So a plain text search like grep (or even ctags) won't do the trick here.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You want <a href="http://ctags.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">Exuberant ctags</a> (old ctags doesn't generate tags for Python).</p>

<p>Once you've installed (the way to do that depends on your platform), run it on your files:</p>

<pre><code>$ /usr/local/bin/ctags *py
</code></pre>

<p>(you can run it multiple times to append tags to an existing tag file, have it recurse into subdirectories, etc, all with command-line options) and it makes a <code>tags</code> file like the following (for brevity I'm using a single Python file with one class defining a single method):</p>

<pre><code>$ cat tags
!_TAG_FILE_FORMAT   2   /extended format; --format=1 will not append ;" to lines/
!_TAG_FILE_SORTED   1   /0=unsorted, 1=sorted, 2=foldcase/
!_TAG_PROGRAM_AUTHOR    Darren Hiebert  /dhiebert@users.sourceforge.net/
!_TAG_PROGRAM_NAME  Exuberant Ctags //
!_TAG_PROGRAM_URL   http://ctags.sourceforge.net    /official site/
!_TAG_PROGRAM_VERSION   5.7 //
Foo a.py    /^class Foo(object):$/;"    c
amethod a.py    /^  def amethod(self): pass$/;" m   class:Foo
</code></pre>

<p>Now, quoting <a href="http://linux.byexamples.com/archives/177/vim-with-ctags/" rel="nofollow">this article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let say when you discover a function
  call which you wanna see the
  definition, simply point the cursor to
  that function and press ctrl ] and it
  will bring you there. If you want to
  go back to where you came from, simply
  press ctrl t. Instead of ctrl t, I
  like to use ctrl i and ctrl o to
  travel to forward and backward of the
  check points.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, control-P does (some attempt at) <em>code completion</em> for identifiers found in <code>tags</code>.
(<code>:help tags</code> in vim will give you more details).</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I sometimes inserted <code>help(varName)</code> into my code, so that when that particular function is run, the help file will show up instead. For example, if I have this code:</p>

<pre><code>def foo(bar):
    bar.baz()
</code></pre>

<p>and I want to figure out what class bar is and what .baz does, I just insert this</p>

<pre><code>def foo(bar):
    help(bar)
    help(bar.baz)
    bar.baz()
</code></pre>

<p>then run the script. Another way which is less invasive is to use <code>print type(bar)</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I'd take an interactive approach similar to Lie Ryan's: run the script in debug mode, set a break at the line of interest, and interactively query the variable in question.</p>

<p>This is a more robust approach than your requested "scan the source code looking for matching methodnames" because it's guaranteed to get you the variable you're actually wondering about, rather than returning a set of possibles.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You could use the pydoc utility that comes with most versions of Python.  On windows this is usually C:\PythonXX\Tools\Scripts\pydocgui.pyw (where XX is the Python version).</p>

<p>Running this will launch a small Tkinter window with a search box.  You can search the auto-generated docs for all installed python modules, or open a browser on the top level documentation.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>If you use <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/" rel="nofollow">Eclipse</a> with <a href="http://pydev.org/" rel="nofollow">PyDev</a> for your IDE, you can use the PyDev Globals Browser. You can search for modules, classes, methods and functions. Clicking on a result will open the source file and move the cursor to the line where the object is defined.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.michaelfogleman.com/static/images/pydev_browser.png" alt="alt text"></p>

<p>You can also hit F3 to jump to the definition of a variable that your cursor is on.  For example if your cursor is on a line like <code>import util</code>, hitting F3 will open util.py.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Given that your editor is vim, may I suggest <a href="http://rope.sourceforge.net/ropevim.html" rel="nofollow">ropevim</a>. It uses rope, a Python refactoring library. Two of ropevim's features are "find occurrences" and "goto definition". Both of these will help you navigate your source tree.</p>
