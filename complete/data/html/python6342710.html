<h3>Question (ID-6342710):</h3><h2>How to optimise the solution for problem 15 of project euler?</h2><p>I wrote the following code in python to solve 
<a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=15" rel="nofollow">problem 15 from project euler</a></p>

<pre><code>grid_size = 2
def get_paths(node):
        global paths

        if  node[0]  &gt;= grid_size and node[1] &gt;= grid_size:
                paths += 1
                return
        else:
                if node[0]&lt;grid_size+1 and node[1] &lt; grid_size+1:
                     get_paths((node[0]+1,node[1]))
                     get_paths((node[0],node[1]+1))
        return paths

def euler():
                print get_paths((0,0))

paths = 0
if __name__ == '__main__':
    euler()
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that runs quite well for the example input [grid of size 2] but its been running for hours for a 20 X 20 grid . 
How can i optimise the following code ? 
Is it a kind of breadth first search problem ? [it seems so to me ]
How can i measure the complexity of my solution in its current form ? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You might want to look into the maths behind this problem. It's not necessary to actually iterate through all routes. (In fact, you'll never make the 1 minute mark like that).</p>

<p>I can post a hint but won't do so unless you ask for it, since I wouldn't want to spoil it for you.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
Yes, the algorithm you're using will never really be optimal since there's no way to reduce the search space of your problem. This means that (as pg1989 stated) you'll have to look into alternative means of solving this problem.</p>

<p>As sverre said looking over here might give a nudge in the right direction:

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Your algorithm is exponential, but only because you are re-evaluating get_paths with the same input many times. Adding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization" rel="nofollow">Memoization</a> to it will make it run in time. Also, you'll need to get rid of the global variable, and use return values instead. See also Dynamic Programming for a similar idea.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>The key is not to make your algorithm run faster, as it will (potentially) run in exponential time, no matter how fast each step is. </p>

<p>It is probably better to find another way of computing the answer. Using your (expensive, but correct) solution as a comparison for small values is probably a sanity-preserver during the algorithm optimization effort.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>This question provides some good insight into optimization. The code is in c# but the algorithms are applicable. Watch out for spoilers, though.</p>

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>It can be solved by simple observation of the pattern for small grids, and determining a straightforward formula for larger grids.  There are over 100 billion paths for a 20x20 grid and any iterative solution will take too long to compute.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>When solving problems on Project Euler, think about the math behind the problem for a long time before starting to code. This problem can be solved without any code whatsoever.</p>

<p>We're trying to count the number of ways through a grid. If you observe that the number of moves <em>down</em> and <em>right</em> do not change regardless of the path, then you only need to worry about the order in which you move down and right. So in the 2x2 case, the following combinations work:</p>

<pre><code>DDRR 
DRDR
RDRD
RRDD
RDDR
DRRD
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that if we pick where we put the <em>R</em> moves, the placement of the <em>D</em> moves is determined. So really we only have to choose, from the 4 movement slots available, which get the <em>R</em> moves. Can you think of a mathematical operation that does this?</p>
