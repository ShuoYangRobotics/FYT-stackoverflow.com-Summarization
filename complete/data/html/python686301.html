<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: consider <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/" rel="nofollow">Learning Python The Hard Way</a>, too. </p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I'd recommend the free e-book <a href="http://openbookproject.net/thinkCSpy/index.xhtml" rel="nofollow">How to Think Like a Computer Scientist - Learning With Python</a></p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>People at my work have the same question. If you're just starting to learn python, I recommend the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don't buy or read any python books.</li>
<li>Give yourself half a day to walk through the excellent online tutorial: <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/tutorial/index.html</a></li>
<li>Bookmark the tutorial and the library reference in your browser: <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/library/index.html</a></li>
<li>Go write some code!</li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I'd highly recommend <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0596007973" rel="nofollow">the Python Cookbook</a>, especially if you're past the "Teach yourself Python" stage and are wanting to solidify your knowledge.  It's a really useful book with a lot of practical solutions to practical problems, all done in a pythonic manner.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>The "Which Python book should I get?" question gets asked a lot around here, so be sure to check the archives for other suggestions.</p>

<p>I agree with the <a href="http://diveintopython.net" rel="nofollow">Dive into Python</a> references.  If you are interested in some of the newer features, check out the work-in-progress <a href="http://diveintopython3.ep.io/" rel="nofollow">Dive into Python 3</a>.</p>

<p>Also, I'm making my way through <a href="http://corepython.com/" rel="nofollow">Core Python Programming</a> and have been impressed so far.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>This is the best starting place for Python: <a href="http://diveintopython.net/" rel="nofollow">Dive into Python</a>.</p>

<p>You can even buy a book-copy if you'd like but the online version is free.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>If you're set on the O'Reilly book, it may be a good idea to wait to get the coverage on Python 2.6 (and likely 3.0).</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>I'd not buy printed book at all. Python is evolving so fast, that books don't cover new features even in the moment you buy it. For example that O'Reilly book (2<sup>nd</sup> ed.) is already 2 years old and <strong>does NOT even cover Python 2.5</strong>. </p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>I learned Python recently by using Dive Into Python downloaded from Mark Pilgrim's site, plus a lot of Google and Stack Overflow searches.   Then, I ordered Python Cookbook so that I could do explore topics deeper than what can be found in introductory books or web searches.  It seems that there is so much content online for free that buying a printed book is not really necessary.</p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>If you already know how to program, then I would recommend not getting Learning Python. It's much longer than it needs to be to cover the material it does. However, if you're looking for a good introduction to programming by way of Python then the book would work just fine.</p>
<br /><b>#10</b><br /><p>If i were you, I would read, in order:</p>
