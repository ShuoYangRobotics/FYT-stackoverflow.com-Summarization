<h3>Question (ID-2965271):</h3><h2>Forced naming of parameters in python</h2><p>In python you may have a function definition:</p>

<pre><code>def info(object, spacing=10, collapse=1)
</code></pre>

<p>which could be called in any of the following ways:</p>

<pre><code>info(odbchelper)                    
info(odbchelper, 12)                
info(odbchelper, collapse=0)        
info(spacing=15, object=odbchelper)
</code></pre>

<p>thanks to python's allowing of any-order arguments, so long as they're named. </p>

<p>The problem we're having is as some of our larger functions grow, people might be adding parameters between <code>spacing</code> and <code>collapse</code>, meaning that the wrong values may be going to parameters that aren't named.  In addition sometimes it's not always clear as to what needs to go in.  We're after a way to force people to name certain parameters - not just a coding standard, but ideally a flag or pydev plugin?</p>

<p>so that in the above 4 examples, only the last would pass the check as all the parameters are named.</p>

<p>Odds are we'll only turn it on for certain functions, but any suggestions as to how to implement this - or if it's even possible would be appreciated.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>This isn't a coding problem, it's a social problem. By creating the code you are creating a contract -- give me these arguments in this order and I'll give you a result. Sometime later, someone is choosing to break that contract. To what end? Why would someone on your team think it's OK to make a backwards-incompatible change in such a manner?</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>I realized that using <code>**kwargs</code> would not solve the problem. If your programmers change function arguments as they wish, one could, for example, change the function to this:</p>

<pre><code>def info(foo, **kwargs):
</code></pre>

<p>and the old code would break again (because now every function call has to include the first argument).</p>

<p>It really comes down to what Bryan says.</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>(...) people might be adding parameters between <code>spacing</code> and <code>collapse</code> (...)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In general, when changing functions, new arguments should always go to the end. Otherwise it breaks the code. Should be obvious.<br>
If someone changes the function so that the code breaks, this change has to be rejected.<br>
(As Bryan says, it is like a contract)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(...) sometimes it's not always clear as to what needs to go in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By looking at the signature of the function (i.e <code>def info(object, spacing=10, collapse=1)</code> ) one should immediately see that every argument that has <strong>not</strong> a default value, is mandatory.<br>
<strong><em>What</em></strong> the argument is for, should go into the docstring.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>Old answer (kept for completeness)</em>:</p>

<p><strike>
This is probably not a good solution:</p>

<p>You can define functions this way:</p>

<pre><code>def info(**kwargs):
    ''' Some docstring here describing possible and mandatory arguments. '''
    spacing = kwargs.get('spacing', 15)
    obj = kwargs.get('object', None)
    if not obj:
       raise ValueError('object is needed')
</code></pre>

<p><code>kwargs</code> is a dictionary that contains any keyword argument. You can check whether a mandatory argument is present and if not, raise an exception.</p>

<p>The downside is, that it might not be that obvious anymore, which arguments are possible, but with a proper docstring, it should be fine.</p>

<p></strike></p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You could use the <code>**</code> operator:</p>

<pre><code>def info(**kwargs):
</code></pre>

<p>this way people are forced to use named parameters.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You could declare your functions as receiving <code>**args</code> only. That would mandate keyword arguments but you'd have some extra work to make sure only valid names are passed in. </p>

<pre><code>def foo(**args):
   print args

foo(1,2) # Raises TypeError: foo() takes exactly 0 arguments (2 given)
foo(hello = 1, goodbye = 2) # Works fine.
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><pre><code>def cheeseshop(kind, *arguments, **keywords):
</code></pre>

<p>in python if use *args that means you can pass n-number of arguments for this parameter - which will be come a list inside function to access</p>

<p>and if use **kw that means its keyword arguments, that can be access as dict - you can pass n-number of kw args, and if you want to restrict that user must enter the sequence and arguments in order then don't use * and ** - (its pythonic way to provide generic solutions for big architectures...)</p>

<p>if you want to restrict your function with default values then you can check inside it</p>

<pre><code>def info(object, spacing, collapse)
  spacing = spacing or 10
  collapse = collapse or 1
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>As other answers say, changing function signatures is a bad idea.  Either add new parameters to the end, or fix every caller if arguments are inserted.</p>

<p>If you still want to do it, use a <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=240808" rel="nofollow">function decorator</a> and the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/inspect.html" rel="nofollow">inspect.getargspec</a> function.  It would be used something like this:</p>

<pre><code>@require_named_args
def info(object, spacing=10, collapse=1):
    ....
</code></pre>

<p>Implementation of <code>require_named_args</code> is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>

<p>I would not bother.  It will be slow every time the function is called, and you will get better results from writing code more carefully.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I don't get why a programmer will add a parameter in between two others in the first place. </p>

<p>If you want the function parameters to be used with names (e.g. <code>info(spacing=15, object=odbchelper)</code> ) then it shouldn't matter what order they are defined in, so you might as well put the new parameters at the end. </p>

<p>If you do want the order to matter then can't expect anything to work if you change it!</p>
