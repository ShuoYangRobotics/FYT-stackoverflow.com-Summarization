<h3>Question (ID-136739):</h3><h2>Python language API</h2><p>I'm starting with Python coming from java. </p>

<p>I was wondering if there exists something similar to JavaDoc API where I can find the class, its methods and and example of how to use it.</p>

<p>I've found very helpul to use <em>help( thing )</em> from the Python ( command line ) </p>

<p>I have found this also:</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.python.org/">http://docs.python.org/</a></p>

<p><a href="http://docs.python.org/modindex.html">http://docs.python.org/modindex.html</a></p>

<p>But it seems to help when you already the class name  you are looking for. In JavaDoc API I have all the classes so if I need something I scroll down to  a class that "sounds like" what I need. Or some times I just browse all the classes to see what they do, and when I need a feature my brain recalls me   <em>We saw something similar in the javadoc remember!?</em> </p>

<p>But I don't seem to find the similar in Python ( yet ) and that why I'm posting this questin. </p>

<p>BTW I know that I would eventually will read this:</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/lib.html">http://docs.python.org/lib/lib.html</a></p>

<p>But, well, I think it is not today.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if you're looking for something more sophisticated, but it does the trick.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The standard python library is fairly well documented. Try jumping into python and importing a module say "os" and running:</p>

<pre><code>import os   
help(os)
</code></pre>

<p>This reads the doc strings on each of the items in the module and displays it. This is exactly what pydoc will do too.</p>

<p>EDIT: <a href="http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">epydoc</a> is probably exactly what you're looking for: </p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><a href="http://docs.python.org/modindex.html" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is a list of all the modules in python, not sure if that's what you're really after.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I've downloaded Python 2.5 from Python.org and It does not contains pydoc.</p>

<p>But it has ( the substitute I guess ) pydocgui...</p>

<pre><code>C:\Python25&gt;dir Tools\Scripts\pydocgui.pyw

<p>This launches a webserver and shows what I was looking for. All the modules plus all the classes that come with the platform.</p>

<p>The Doc dir contains the same as in:</p>

<p>Thanks a lot for guide me  to pydoc.</p>

<p>I suggest that you're making a mistake.  The lib doc has "the class, its methods and and example of how to use it."   It <em>is</em> what you are looking for.  </p>

<p>I use both Java and Python all the time.  Dig into the library doc, you'll find everything you're looking for.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>If you're working on Windows <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/activepython/index.mhtml" rel="nofollow">ActiveState Python</a> comes with the documentation, including the library reference in a searchable help file.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>It doesn't directly answer your question (so I'll probably be downgraded), but you may be interested in <a href="http://www.jython.org/Project/" rel="nofollow">Jython</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jython is an implementation of the high-level, dynamic, object-oriented language Python written in 100% Pure Java, and seamlessly integrated with the Java platform. It thus allows you to run Python on any Java platform.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since you are coming from Java, Jython may help you leverage Python while still allowing you to use your Java knowledge.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>You can set the <em>environment variable</em> <strong>PYTHONDOCS</strong> to point to where the python documentation is installed.</p>

<p>On my system, it's in <em>/usr/share/doc/python2.5</em></p>

<p>So you can define this variable in your <em>shell profile</em> or somewhere else depending on your system:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>export PYTHONDOCS=/usr/share/doc/python2.5</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, if you open an interractive python console, you can call the help system. For exemple:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; help(Exception)
&gt;&gt;&gt; Help on class Exception in module exceptions:

&gt;&gt;&gt; class Exception(BaseException)
&gt;&gt;&gt;  |  Common base class for all non-exit exceptions.
&gt;&gt;&gt;  |  
&gt;&gt;&gt;  |  Method resolution order:
&gt;&gt;&gt;  |      Exception
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Documentation is here:</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-pydoc.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/lib/module-pydoc.html</a></p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>Also try</p>

<pre><code>pydoc -p 11111
</code></pre>

<p>Then type in web browser <a href="http://localhost:11111" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:11111</a></p>

<p>EDIT: of course you can use any other value for port number instead of 11111</p>
