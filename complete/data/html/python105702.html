<h3>Question (ID-105702):</h3><h2>Making a beta code for a public django site</h2><p>I'm about to put a beta version of the site I'm working on up on the web. It needs to have a beta code to restrict access. The site is written in django.</p>

<p>I don't want to change the fundamental Auth system to accommodate a beta code, and I don't care particularly that the security of the beta code is iron-clad, just that it's a significant stumbling block.</p>

<p>How should I do this? It's a fairly large project so adding code to every view is far from ideal.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>That solution works well. The Middleware Class I ended up with this this:</p>

<pre><code>from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect

class BetaMiddleware(object):
    """
    Require beta code session key in order to view any page.
    """
    def process_request(self, request):
        if request.path != '/beta/' and not request.session.get('in_beta'):
            return HttpResponseRedirect('%s?next=%s' % ('/beta/', request.path))
</code></pre>

If they don't have it, then have it return a redirect to a "enter beta code" page that, when posted to with the right code, sets that session variable to <code>True</code>.</p>

<p>Making it a public beta then just consists of removing that middleware from your <code>MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES</code> setting.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You can probably restrict access to the entire site via apache with htaccess, taking the problem out of the django's project space entirely.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You should be able to add <code>@login_required</code> decorators across the board and be done with it.  Unless you have a boat-load of view functions, it shouldn't be too horrible.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Do what StackOverflow did.</p>

<p>They had a simple email/password form. It had a single hard-coded password (falkensmaze). When the user gets the password right set a cookie. eg. auth=1</p>

<p>Don't worry about it being unsecure. Who care's if someone hacks into the beta?</p>

<p>Apache/htaccess is also a nice and simple solution.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I'm not sure what version of the Pinax code you're using, but they've built in the ability to close the site off for a private beta so you don't need to do much work yourself.</p>

<p>The link to the specific project template for a private beta site is here: <a href="http://github.com/pinax/pinax/tree/3ad73d1ba44f37365333bae17b507668b0eb7e16/pinax/projects/private_beta_project" rel="nofollow">http://github.com/pinax/pinax/tree/3ad73d1ba44f37365333bae17b507668b0eb7e16/pinax/projects/private_beta_project</a> although I think they might have since added that functionality to all the project templates.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Great snippet but it resulted lots of problems for me related OpenId sessions. So I end up relying on Cookies instead of the Session:</p>

<pre><code>class BetaMiddleware(object):
    """
    Require beta code cookie key in order to view any page.
    """
    set_beta = False
    def process_request(self, request):
        referer = request.META.get('HTTP_REFERER', '')

        if request.method == 'GET' and not 'is_in_beta' in request.COOKIES:
            return HttpResponseRedirect('%s?next=%s' % ('/beta/', request.path))

        if request.method == 'POST' and 'pass' in request.POST:
            code = request.POST['pass']

            if code=='beta':
                self.set_beta = True
                return HttpResponseRedirect('%s' % '/')

    def process_response(self, request, response):        

        if self.set_beta is True:
            response.set_cookie('is_in_beta', '1')
        return response
</code></pre>

<p>It's not secure but that's enough for me. This also works with just a beta html page.</p>
