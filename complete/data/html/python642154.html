<h3>Question (ID-642154):</h3><h2>How to convert strings into integers in python?</h2><p>I have a tuple of tuples from MySQL query like this:</p>

<pre><code>T1 = (('13', '17', '18', '21', '32'),
      ('07', '11', '13', '14', '28'),
      ('01', '05', '06', '08', '15', '16'))
</code></pre>

<p>I'd like to convert all the string elements into integers and put it back nicely to list of lists this time:</p>

<pre><code>T2 = [[13, 17, 18, 21, 32], [7, 11, 13, 14, 28], [1, 5, 6, 8, 15, 16]]
</code></pre>

<p>I tried to achieve it with "eval" but didn't get any decent result yet.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p><code>int()</code> is the Python function to convert a string into an integer value.</p>

<p>If you know the structure of your list (that it simply contains lists, only one level), you could do this:</p>

<pre><code>T2 = [map(int, x) for x in T1]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You can do this with a list comprehension:</p>

<pre><code>T2 = [[int(column) for column in row] for row in T1]
</code></pre>

<p>The inner list comprehension (<code>[int(column) for column in row]</code>) builds a <code>list</code> of <code>int</code>s from a sequence of <code>int</code>-able objects, like decimal strings, in <code>row</code>. The outer list comprehension (<code>[... for row in T1])</code>) builds a list of the results of the inner list comprehension applied to each item in <code>T1</code>.</p>

<p>The code snippet will fail if any of the rows contain objects that can't be converted by <code>int</code>. You'll need a smarter function if you want to process rows containing non-decimal strings.</p>

<p>If you know the structure of the rows, you can replace the inner list comprehension with a call to a function of the row. Eg.</p>

<pre><code>T2 = [parse_a_row_of_T1(row) for row in T1]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>use int() to convert string to int</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I would agree with everyones answers so far but the problem is is that if you do not have all integers they will crash.</p>

<p>If you wanted to exclude non-integers then</p>

<pre><code>T1 = (('13', '17', '18', '21', '32'),
      ('07', '11', '13', '14', '28'),
      ('01', '05', '06', '08', '15', '16'))
new_list = list(list(int(a) for a in b) for b in T1 if a.isdigit())
</code></pre>

<p>This yields only actual digits.  The reason I don't use direct list comprehensions is because list comprehension leaks their internal variables.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I would rather prefer using only comprehension lists:</p>

<pre><code>[[int(y) for y in x] for x in T1]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>If it's only a tuple of tuples, something like <code>rows=[map(int, row) for row in rows]</code> will do the trick. (There's a list comprehension and a call to map(f, lst), which is equal to [f(a) for a in lst], in there.)</p>

<p>Eval is <em>not</em> what you want to do, in case there's something like <code>__import__("os").unlink("importantsystemfile")</code> in your database for some reason.
Always validate your input (if with nothing else, the exception int() will raise if you have bad input).</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Using list comprehensions:</p>

<pre><code>t2 = [map(int, list(l)) for l in t1]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>T3=[]</p>

<pre><code>for i in range(0,len(T1)):
    T3.append([])
    for j in range(0,len(T1[i])):
        b=int(T1[i][j])
        T3[i].append(b)

print T3
</code></pre>
