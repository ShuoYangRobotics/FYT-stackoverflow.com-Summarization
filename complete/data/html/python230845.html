<h3>Question (ID-230845):</h3><h2>Make python enter password when running a csh script</h2><p>I'm writing a python script that executes a csh script in Solaris 10. The csh script prompts the user for the root password (which I know) but I'm not sure how to make the python script answer the prompt with the password. Is this possible? Here is what I'm using to execute the csh script:</p>

<pre><code>import commands

commands.getoutput('server stop')
</code></pre>

<p>Oh, and remember that hard-encoding root's password in a shell or python script is potentially a security hole :D</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Use <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/lib/module-subprocess.html" rel="nofollow">subprocess</a>.  Call Popen() to create your process and use communicate() to send it text.  Sorry, forgot to include the PIPE..</p>

<pre><code>from subprocess import Popen, PIPE

proc = Popen(['server', 'stop'], stdin=PIPE)

proc.communicate('password')
</code></pre>

<p>You would do better do avoid the password and try a scheme like sudo and sudoers.  Pexpect, mentioned elsewhere, is not part of the standard library.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><pre><code>import pexpect
child = pexpect.spawn('server stop')
child.expect_exact('Password:')

child.sendline('password')

print "Stopping the servers..."

index = child.expect_exact(['Server processes successfully stopped.', 'Server is not running...'], 60)
child.expect(pexpect.EOF)
</code></pre>

<p>Did the trick! Pexpect rules!</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Should be able to pass it as a parameter.  something like:</p>

<pre><code>commands.getoutput('server stop -p password')
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>This seems to work better:</p>

<pre><code>import popen2

(stdout, stdin) = popen2.popen2('server stop')

stdin.write("password")
</code></pre>

<p>But it's not 100% yet. Even though "password" is the correct password I'm still getting su: Sorry back from the csh script when it's trying to su to root.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>To avoid having to answer the Password question in the python script I'm just going to run the script as root. This question is still unanswered but I guess I'll just do it this way for now.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>add input= in proc.communicate() make it run, for guys who like to use standard lib</p>

<p>from subprocess import Popen, PIPE</p>

<p>proc = Popen(['server', 'stop'], stdin=PIPE)</p>

<p>proc.communicate(<strong>input=</strong>'password')</p>
