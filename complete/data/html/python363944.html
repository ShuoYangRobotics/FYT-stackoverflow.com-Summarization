<h3>Question (ID-363944):</h3><h2>Python idiom to return first item or None</h2><p>I'm sure there's a simpler way of doing this that's just not occurring to me.</p>

<p>I'm calling a bunch of methods that return a list.  The list may be empty.  If the list is non-empty, I want to return the first item; otherwise, I want to return None.  This code works:</p>

<pre><code>list = get_list()
if len(list) &gt; 0: return list[0]
return None
</code></pre>

<p>It seems to me that there should be a simple one-line idiom for doing this, but for the life of me I can't think of it.  Is there?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>The reason that I'm looking for a one-line expression here is not that I like incredibly terse code, but because I'm having to write a lot of code like this:</p>

<pre><code>x = get_first_list()
if x:
    # do something with x[0]
    # inevitably forget the [0] part, and have a bug to fix
y = get_second_list()
if y:
    # do something with y[0]
    # inevitably forget the [0] part AGAIN, and have another bug to fix
</code></pre>

<p>What I'd like to be doing can certainly be accomplished with a function (and probably will be):</p>

<pre><code>def first_item(list_or_none):
    if list_or_none: return list_or_none[0]

x = first_item(get_first_list())
if x:
    # do something with x
y = first_item(get_second_list())
if y:
    # do something with y
</code></pre>

<p>I posted the question because I'm frequently surprised by what simple expressions in Python can do, and I thought that writing a function was a silly thing to do if there was a simple expression could do the trick.  But seeing these answers, it seems like a function <em>is</em> the simple solution.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-14):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The best way is this:</p>

<pre><code>a = get_list()
return a[0] if a else None
</code></pre>

<p>You could also do it in one line, but it's much harder for the programmer to read:</p>

<pre><code>return (get_list()[:1] or [None])[0]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><pre><code>def get_first(iterable, default=None):
    if iterable:
        for item in iterable:
            return item
    return default
</code></pre>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>x = get_first(get_first_list())
if x:
    ...
y = get_first(get_second_list())
if y:
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>Another option is to inline the above function:</p>

<pre><code>for x in get_first_list() or []:
    # process x
    break # process at most one item
for y in get_second_list() or []:
    # process y
    break
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>The OP's solution is nearly there, there are just a few things to make it more Pythonic.</p>

<p>For one, there's no need to get the length of the list. Empty lists in Python evaluate to False in an if check. Just simply say</p>

<pre><code>if list:
</code></pre>

<p>Additionally, it's a very Bad Idea to assign to variables that overlap with reserved words. "list" is a reserved word in Python.</p>

<p>So let's change that to</p>

<pre><code>some_list = get_list()
if some_list:
</code></pre>

<p>A really important point that a lot of solutions here miss is that <strong>all Python functions/methods return None by default</strong>. Try the following below.</p>

<pre><code>def does_nothing():
    pass

foo = does_nothing()
print foo
</code></pre>

<p>Unless you need to return None to terminate a function early, it's unnecessary to explicitly return None. Quite succinctly, just return the first entry, should it exist.</p>

<pre><code>some_list = get_list()
if some_list:
    return list[0]
</code></pre>

<p>And finally, perhaps this was implied, but just to be explicit (because <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/" rel="nofollow">explicit is better than implicit</a>), you should not have your function get the list from another function; just pass it in as a parameter. So, the final result would be</p>

<pre><code>def get_first_item(some_list): 
    if some_list:
        return list[0]

my_list = get_list()
first_item = get_first_item(my_list)
</code></pre>

<p>As I said, the OP was nearly there, and just a few touches give it the Python flavor you're looking for.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><pre><code>(get_list()[0:1] or [None])[0]
</code></pre>

<p>That should work, but it's a mess.</p>

<p>BTW I didn't use the variable list, because that overwrites the builtin list() function.</p>

<p>Edit:  I had a slightly simpler, but wrong version here earlier.</p>

<p>Here's another approach:</p>

<pre><code>(get_list() + [None])[0]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><pre><code>for item in get_list():
    return item
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Frankly speaking, I do not think there is a better idiom: your is clear and terse - no need for anything "better". Maybe, but this is really a matter of taste, you could change <code>if len(list) &gt; 0:</code> with <code>if list:</code> - an empty list will always evaluate to False.</p>

<p>On a related note, Python is <strong>not</strong> Perl (no pun intended!), you do not have to get the coolest code possible.<br>
Actually, the worst code I have seen in Python, was also very cool :-) and completely unmaintainable.</p>

<p>By the way, most of the solution I have seen here do not take into consideration when list[0] evaluates to False (e.g. empty string, or zero) - in this case, they all return None and not the correct element.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><pre><code>try:
    return a[0]
except IndexError:
    return None
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>For the heck of it, here's yet another possibility.</p>

<pre><code>return None if not get_list() else get_list()[0]
</code></pre>

<p>Benefit:
This method handles the case where get_list is None, without using try/except or assignment. To my knowledge, none of the implementations above can handle this possibility</p>

<p>Downfalls:
get_list() is called twice, quite unnecessarily, especially if the list is long and/or created when the function is called.</p>

<p>The truth is, it's more "Pythonic" in my opinion, to provide code that is readable than it is to make a one-liner just because you can :) I have to admit I am guilty many times of unnecessarily compacting Python code just because I'm so impressed how small I can make a complex function look :)</p>

<p>Edit:
As user "hasen j" commented below, the conditional expression above is new in Python 2.5, as described here: <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.5/whatsnew/pep-308.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.python.org/doc/2.5/whatsnew/pep-308.html</a>. Thanks, hasen!</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>You could use <a href="http://www.refactoring.com/catalog/extractMethod.html" rel="nofollow">Extract Method</a>. In other words extract that code into a method which you'd then call.</p>

<p>I wouldn't try to compress it much more, the one liners seem harder to read than the verbose version. And if you use Extract Method, it's a one liner ;)</p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>isn't the idiomatic python equivalent to C-style ternary operators </p>

<pre><code>cond and true_expr or false_expr
</code></pre>

<p>ie. </p>

<pre><code>list = get_list()
return list and list[0] or None
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#10</b><br /><p>Using the and-or trick:</p>

<pre><code>a = get_list()
return a and a[0] or None</code></pre>
<br /><b>#11</b><br /><p>Several people have suggested doing something like this:</p>

<pre><code>list = get_list()
return list and list[0] or None
</code></pre>

<p>That works in many cases, but it will only work if list[0] is not equal to 0, False, or an empty string.  If list[0] is 0, False, or an empty string, the method will incorrectly return None.</p>

<p>(I've created this bug in my own code one too many times!)</p>
<br /><b>#12</b><br /><p>Out of curiosity, I ran timings on two of the solutions. The solution which uses a return statement to prematurely end a for loop is slightly more costly on my machine with Python 2.5.1, I suspect this has to do with setting up the iterable.</p>

<pre><code>import random
import timeit

def index_first_item(some_list):
    if some_list:
        return some_list[0]


def return_first_item(some_list):
    for item in some_list:
        return item


empty_lists = []
for i in range(10000):
    empty_lists.append([])

assert empty_lists[0] is not empty_lists[1]

full_lists = []
for i in range(10000):
    full_lists.append(list([random.random() for i in range(10)]))

mixed_lists = empty_lists[:50000] + full_lists[:50000]
random.shuffle(mixed_lists)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    ENV = 'import firstitem'
    test_data = ('empty_lists', 'full_lists', 'mixed_lists')
    funcs = ('index_first_item', 'return_first_item')
    for data in test_data:
        print "%s:" % data
        for func in funcs:
            t = timeit.Timer('firstitem.%s(firstitem.%s)' % (
                func, data), ENV)
            times = t.repeat()
            avg_time = sum(times) / len(times)
            print "  %s:" % func
            for time in times:
                print "    %f seconds" % time
            print "    %f seconds avg." % avg_time

def do_something(element):
