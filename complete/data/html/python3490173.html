<h3>Question (ID-3490173):</h3><h2>How can I speed up fetching pages with urllib2 in python?</h2><p>I have a script that fetches several web pages and parses the info.</p>

<p>(An example can be seen at <a href="http://bluedevilbooks.com/search/?DEPT=MATH&amp;CLASS=103&amp;SEC=01" rel="nofollow">http://bluedevilbooks.com/search/?DEPT=MATH&amp;CLASS=103&amp;SEC=01</a> )</p>

<p>I ran cProfile on it, and as I assumed, urlopen takes up a lot of time. Is there a way to fetch the pages faster? Or a way to fetch several pages at once? I'll do whatever is simplest, as I'm new to python and web developing.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance! :)</p>

<p>UPDATE: I have a function called <code>fetchURLs()</code>, which I use to make an array of the URLs I need
so something like <code>urls = fetchURLS()</code>.The URLS are all XML files from Amazon and eBay APIs (which confuses me as to why it takes so long to load, maybe my webhost is slow?)</p>

<p>What I need to do is load each URL, read each page, and send that data to another part of the script which will parse and display the data.</p>

<p>Note that I can't do the latter part until ALL of the pages have been fetched, that's what my issue is.</p>

<p>Also, my host limits me to 25 processes at a time, I believe, so whatever is easiest on the server would be nice :)</p>

<p>I've gotta say, I do like that the sequential fetches performed <em>better</em> for me.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I'm expanding the answer to include a more polished example. I have found a lot hostility and misinformation in this post regarding threading v.s. async I/O. Therefore I also adding more argument to refute certain invalid claim. I hope this will help people to choose the right tool for the right job.</p>

<p>This is a dup to a question 3 days ago.</p>

<p>Python urllib2.open is slow, need a better way to read several urls - Stack Overflow
  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3472515/python-urllib2-open-is-slow-need-a-better-way-to-read-several-urls/3472905#3472905">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3472515/python-urllib2-open-is-slow-need-a-better-way-to-read-several-urls/3472905#3472905</a></p>

<p>I'm polishing the code to show how to fetch multiple webpage in parallel using threads.</p>

<pre><code>import time
import threading
import Queue

# utility - spawn a thread to execute target for each args
def run_parallel_in_threads(target, args_list):
    result = Queue.Queue()
    # wrapper to collect return value in a Queue
    def task_wrapper(*args):
        result.put(target(*args))
    threads = [threading.Thread(target=task_wrapper, args=args) for args in args_list]
    for t in threads:
        t.start()
    for t in threads:
        t.join()
    return result

def dummy_task(n):
    for i in xrange(n):
        time.sleep(0.1)
    return n

# below is the application code
urls = [
    ('http://www.google.com/',),
    ('http://www.lycos.com/',),
    ('http://www.bing.com/',),
    ('http://www.altavista.com/',),
    ('http://achewood.com/',),
]

def fetch(url):
    return urllib2.urlopen(url).read()

run_parallel_in_threads(fetch, urls)
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the application specific code has only 3 lines, which can be collapsed into 1 line if you are aggressive. I don't think anyone can justify their claim that this is complex and unmaintainable. </p>

<p>Unfortunately most other threading code posted here has some flaws. Many of them do active polling to wait for the code to finish. <code>join()</code> is a better way to synchronize the code. I think this code has improved upon all the threading examples so far.</p>

<p><strong>keep-alive connection</strong></p>

<p>WoLpH's suggestion about using keep-alive connection could be very useful if all you URLs are pointing to the same server.</p>

<p><strong>twisted</strong></p>

<p>Aaron Gallagher is a fans of <code>twisted</code> framework and he is hostile any people who suggest thread. Unfortunately a lot of his claims are misinformation. For example he said "-1 for suggesting threads. This is IO-bound; threads are useless here." This contrary to evidence as both Nick T and I have demonstrated speed gain from the using thread. In fact I/O bound application has the most to gain from using Python's thread (v.s. no gain in CPU bound application). Aaron's misguided criticism on thread shows he is rather confused about parallel programming in general.</p>

<p><strong>Right tool for the right job</strong></p>

<p>I'm well aware of the issues pertain to parallel programming using threads, python, async I/O and so on. Each tool has their pros and cons. For each situation there is an appropriate tool. I'm not against twisted (though I have not deployed one myself). But I don't believe we can flat out say that thread is BAD and twisted is GOOD in all situations.</p>

<p>For example, if the OP's requirement is to fetch 10,000 website in parallel, async I/O will be prefereable. Threading won't be appropriable (unless maybe with stackless Python).</p>

<p>Aaron's opposition to threads are mostly generalizations. He fail to recognize that this is a trivial parallelization task. Each task is independent and do not share resources. So most of his attack do not apply.</p>

<p>Given my code has no external dependency, I'll call it right tool for the right job.</p>

<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>

<p>I think most people would agree that performance of this task is largely depend on the networking code and the external server, where the performance of platform code should have negligible effect. However Aaron's benchmark show an 50% speed gain over the threaded code. I think it is necessary to response to this apparent speed gain.</p>

<p>In Nick's code, there is an obvious flaw that caused the inefficiency. But how do you explain the 233ms speed gain over my code? I think even twisted fans will refrain from jumping into conclusion to attribute this to the efficiency of twisted. There are, after all, a huge amount of variable outside of the system code, like the remote server's performance, network, caching, and difference implementation between urllib2 and twisted web client and so on.</p>

<p>Just to make sure Python's threading will not incur a huge amount of inefficiency, I do a quick benchmark to spawn 5 threads and then 500 threads. I am quite comfortable to say the overhead of spawning 5 thread is negligible and cannot explain the 233ms speed difference.</p>

<pre><code>In [274]: %time run_parallel_in_threads(dummy_task, [(0,)]*5)
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.00 s
Out[275]: &lt;Queue.Queue instance at 0x038B2878&gt;

In [276]: %time run_parallel_in_threads(dummy_task, [(0,)]*500)
CPU times: user 0.16 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.16 s
Wall time: 0.16 s

In [278]: %time run_parallel_in_threads(dummy_task, [(10,)]*500)
CPU times: user 1.13 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 1.13 s
Wall time: 1.13 s       &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; This means 0.13s of overhead
</code></pre>

<p>Further testing on my parallel fetching shows a huge variability in the response time in 17 runs. (Unfortunately I don't have twisted to verify Aaron's code).</p>

<pre><code>0.75 s
0.38 s
0.59 s
0.38 s
0.62 s
1.50 s
0.49 s
0.36 s

0.61 s
0.81 s
0.46 s
1.21 s
2.87 s
1.04 s
1.72 s
</code></pre>

<p>My testing does not support Aaron's conclusion that threading is consistently slower than async I/O by a measurable margin. Given the number of variables involved, I have to say this is not a valid test to measure the systematic performance difference between async I/O and threading.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Here is an example using python <code>Threads</code>. The other threaded examples here launch a thread per url, which is not very friendly behaviour if it causes too many hits for the server to handle (for example it is common for spiders to have many urls on the same host)</p>

<pre><code>from threading import Thread
from urllib2 import urlopen
from time import time, sleep

WORKERS=1
urls = ['http://docs.python.org/library/threading.html',
        'http://docs.python.org/library/thread.html',
        'http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html',
        'http://docs.python.org/howto/urllib2.html']*10
results = []

class Worker(Thread):
    def run(self):
        while urls:
            url = urls.pop()
            results.append((url, urlopen(url).read()))

start = time()
threads = [Worker() for i in range(WORKERS)]
any(t.start() for t in threads)

while len(results)&lt;40:
    sleep(0.1)
print time()-start
</code></pre>

<p>Note: The times given here are for 40 urls and will depend a lot on the speed of your internet connection and the latency to the server. Being in Australia, my ping is > 300ms</p>

<p>With <code>WORKERS=1</code> it took 86 seconds to run<br>
With <code>WORKERS=4</code> it took 23 seconds to run<br>
with <code>WORKERS=10</code> it took 10 seconds to run  </p>

<p>so having 10 threads downloading is 8.6 times as fast as a single thread.</p>

<p>Here is an upgraded version that uses a Queue. There are at least a couple of advantages.<br>
1. The urls are requested in the order that they appear in the list<br>
2. Can use <code>q.join()</code> to detect when the requests have all completed<br>
3. The results are kept in the same order as the url list</p>

<pre><code>from threading import Thread
from urllib2 import urlopen
from time import time, sleep
from Queue import Queue

WORKERS=10
urls = ['http://docs.python.org/library/threading.html',
        'http://docs.python.org/library/thread.html',
        'http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html',
        'http://docs.python.org/howto/urllib2.html']*10
results = [None]*len(urls)

def worker():
    while True:
        i, url = q.get()
        # print "requesting ", i, url       # if you want to see what's going on
        results[i]=urlopen(url).read()
        q.task_done()

start = time()
q = Queue()
for i in range(WORKERS):
    t=Thread(target=worker)
    t.daemon = True
    t.start()

for i,url in enumerate(urls):
    q.put((i,url))
q.join()
print time()-start
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The actual wait is probably not in <code>urllib2</code> but in the server and/or your network connection to the server.</p>

<p>There are 2 ways of speeding this up.</p>

<ol>
<li>Keep the connection alive (see this question on how to do that: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1037406/python-urllib2-with-keep-alive">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1037406/python-urllib2-with-keep-alive</a>)</li>
<li>Use multiplle connections, you can use threads or an async approach as Aaron Gallagher suggested. For that, simply use any threading example and you should do fine :) You can also use the <code>multiprocessing</code> lib to make things pretty easy.</li>
</ol>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Fetching webpages obviously will take a while as you're not accessing anything local.  If you have several to access, you could use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/threading.html" rel="nofollow"><code>threading</code></a> module to run a couple at once.</p>

<p>Here's a very crude example</p>

<pre><code>import threading
import urllib2
import time

urls = ['http://docs.python.org/library/threading.html',
        'http://docs.python.org/library/thread.html',
        'http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html',
        'http://docs.python.org/howto/urllib2.html']
data1 = []
data2 = []

class PageFetch(threading.Thread):
    def __init__(self, url, datadump):
        self.url = url
        self.datadump = datadump
        threading.Thread.__init__(self)
    def run(self):
        page = urllib2.urlopen(self.url)
        self.datadump.append(page.read()) # don't do it like this.

print "Starting threaded reads:"
start = time.clock()
for url in urls:
    PageFetch(url, data2).start()
while len(data2) &lt; len(urls): pass # don't do this either.
print "...took %f seconds" % (time.clock() - start)

print "Starting sequential reads:"
start = time.clock()
for url in urls:
    page = urllib2.urlopen(url)
    data1.append(page.read())
print "...took %f seconds" % (time.clock() - start)

for i,x in enumerate(data1):
    print len(data1[i]), len(data2[i])
</code></pre>

<p>This was the output when I ran it:</p>

<pre><code>Starting threaded reads:
...took 2.035579 seconds
Starting sequential reads:
...took 4.307102 seconds
73127 19923
19923 59366
361483 73127
59366 361483
</code></pre>

<p>Grabbing the data from the thread by appending to a list is probably ill-advised (Queue would be better) but it illustrates that there is a difference.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Nowadays there is excellent Python lib that do this for you called <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/" rel="nofollow">requests</a>.</p>

<p>Use standard api of requests if you want solution based on threads or async api (using gevent under the hood) if you want solution based on non-blocking IO.</p>
