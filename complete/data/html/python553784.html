<h3>Question (ID-553784):</h3><h2>Can you use a string to instantiate a class in python?</h2><p>I'm using a builder pattern to seperate a bunch of different configuration possibilities. Basically, I have a bunch of classes that are named an ID (something like ID12345). These all inherit from the base builder class. In my script, I need to instantiate an instance for each class (about 50) every time this app runs. So, I'm trying to see if instead of doing something like this:</p>

<pre><code>ProcessDirector = ProcessDirector()
ID12345 = ID12345()
ID01234 = ID01234()

ProcessDirector.construct(ID12345)
ProcessDirector.construct(ID01234)

ID12345.run()
ID01234.run()
</code></pre>

<p>Can I do something like this (I know this doesn't work):</p>

<pre><code>IDS = ["ID12345", "ID01234"]

ProcessDirector = ProcessDirector()
for id in IDS:
  builder = id() #some how instantiate class from string
  ProcessDirector.construct(builder)
  builder.run()
</code></pre>

<p>That way, when I need to add a new one in the future, all I have to do is add the id to the IDS list, rather than peppering the new ID throughout the code. </p>

<h2>EDIT</h2>

<p>Looks like there are some different opinions based on where the data is coming from. These IDs are entered in a file that no one else has access to. I'm not reading the strings from the command line, and I'd like to be able to do as little alteration when adding a new ID in the future. </p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><strong>Never</strong> use <code>eval()</code> if you can help it. Python has <strong>so</strong> many better options (dispatch dictionary, <code>getattr()</code>, etc.) that you should never have to use the security hole known as <code>eval()</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Not totally sure this is what you want, but it seems like a more Python'y way to instantiate a bunch of classes listed in a string:</p>

<pre><code>class idClasses:
    class ID12345:pass
    class ID01234:pass
# could also be: import idClasses

class ProcessDirector:
    def __init__(self):
        self.allClasses = []

    def construct(self, builderName):
        targetClass = getattr(idClasses, builderName)
        instance = targetClass()
        self.allClasses.append(instance)

IDS = ["ID12345", "ID01234"]

director = ProcessDirector()
for id in IDS:
    director.construct(id)

print director.allClasses
# [&lt;__main__.ID12345 instance at 0x7d850&gt;, &lt;__main__.ID01234 instance at 0x7d918&gt;]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>If you wanted to avoid an eval(), you could just do:</p>

<pre><code>id = "1234asdf"
constructor = globals()[id]
instance = constructor()
</code></pre>

<p>Provided that the class is defined in (or imported into) your current scope.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Simplest way is to just create a dict.</p>

<pre><code>class A(object): 
    pass
class B(object): 
    pass

namedclass = {'ID12345': A, 'ID2': A, 'B': B, 'AnotherB': B,  'ID01234': B}
</code></pre>

<p>Then use it (your code example):</p>

<pre><code>IDS = ["ID12345", "ID01234"]

ProcessDirector = ProcessDirector()
for id in IDS:
    builder = namedclass[id]() 
    ProcessDirector.construct(builder)
    builder.run()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>There's some stuff missing from your question, so I'm forced to guess at the omitted stuff.  Feel free to edit your question to correct the omissions.</p>

<pre><code>class ProcessDirector( object ):
    # does something

class ID12345( SomeKindOfProcess ):
    pass

class ID001234( SomeKindOfProcess ):
    pass

idList= [ID12345, ID01234]

theProcessDirector = ProcessDirector()
for id in idList:
  builder = id() #Instantiate an object from the class object
  theProcessDirector.construct(builder)
  builder.run()
</code></pre>

<p>This works very nicely.  It doesn't instantiate from a string -- in practice you don't often want this.  Sometimes, but rarely.  More commonly, you a list of class objects from which you want instance objects.</p>

<p>If you actually are getting your class names from the command line, then you'd make the following small change.</p>

<pre><code>validClasses = [ ID12345, ID01234 ]
validMap = dict( ( (c.__name__, c) for c in validClasses ) )
nameStrings = [ "ID12345", "ID01234" ] # from your command-line 
idList= [ validMap[s] for s in nameStrings ]
</code></pre>

<p>Everything else remains the same.</p>

<p>[Also, if possible, try to start instance variable names with lowercase letters.  Names which start with Uppercase Letters  are usually class names.]</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>Removed <code>eval</code>.  In spite of the fact that <code>eval()</code> is absolutely <strong>not</strong>  a security hole.  Eval (and <code>exec</code> and <code>execfile</code>) are only a problem if someone specifically grants access to malicious users.</p>
