<h3>Question (ID-1764291):</h3><h2>raw escape in python except last char</h2><p>Why in python I can't use:</p>

<pre><code>r"c:\"
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>When a string must contain the same quote character with with it's started, escaping that character is the only available workaround -- so the design alternative was either to make raw-string literals physically unable to contain their leading quote character, or keep the "backlash escapes" convention, even in string literals, just for quote characters.</p>

<p>Since raw-string literals were designed for handy representation of regular expression patterns (not for DOS / Windows paths!-), and in RE patterns a trailing backslash is never necessary, the design decision was easy (based on the real use case for raw-string literals).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... a raw string cannot end in a single backslash (since the backslash would escape the following quote character).</p>
</blockquote>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Use <code>"c:/"</code> or <code>"c:\\"</code>.  Raw string literals are for escaping escape-sequences, not for including literal backslashes, though they do work that way, except in this exact case.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Its a known case I think, better use "c:\\" for that case.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Even with raw strings, <code>\"</code> causes the <code>"</code> not to be interpreted as the end of the string (though the backslash gets into your string), so <code>r"foo\"bar"</code> would be a legal string. This is convenient enough when writing regex but not great for writing paths. </p>

<p>This is not a big deal as most of the time you should be using <code>os.path</code> and other modules to deal with your paths.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Raw strings were designed to ease
  creating input for processors (chiefly
  regular expression engines) that want
  to do their own backslash escape
  processing. Such processors consider
  an unmatched trailing backslash to be
  an error anyway, so raw strings
  disallow that. In return, they allow
  you to pass on the string quote
  character by escaping it with a
  backslash. These rules work well when
  r-strings are used for their intended
  purpose.</p>
