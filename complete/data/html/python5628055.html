<h3>Question (ID-5628055):</h3><h2>Execute statement every N iterations in Python</h2><p>I have a very long loop, and I would like to check the status every N iterations, in my specific case I have a loop of 10 million elements and I want to print a short report every millionth iteration.</p>

<p>So, currently I am doing just (n is the iteration counter):</p>

<pre><code>if (n % 1000000==0):
    print('Progress report...')
</code></pre>

<p>but I am worried I am slowing down the process by computing the modulus at each iteration, as one iteration lasts just few milliseconds.</p>

<p>Is there a better way to do this? Or shouldn't I worry at all about the modulus operation?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Is it really slowing down? You have to try and see for yourself. It won't be much of a slowdown, but if we're talking about nanoseconds it may be considerable. Alternatively you can convert one 10 million loop to two smaller loops:</p>

<pre><code>m = 1000000
for i in range(10):
    for i in range(m):
        // do sth
    print("Progress report")
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>How about keeping a counter and resetting it to zero when you reach the wanted number? Adding and checking equality is faster than modulo.</p>

<pre><code>printcounter = 0

# Whatever a while loop is in Python
while (...):   
    ...
    if (printcounter == 1000000):
        print('Progress report...')
        printcounter = 0
    ...
    printcounter += 1
</code></pre>

<p>Although it's quite possible that the compiler is doing some sort of optimization like this for you already... but this may give you some peace of mind.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I'd do some testing to see how much time your modulus calls are consuming.  You can use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/timeit.html" rel="nofollow">timeit</a> for that.  If your results indicate a need for time reduction, another approach which eliminates your modulus calculation:</p>

<pre><code>for m in xrange(m_min, m_max):
    for n in xrange(n_min, n_max):
        #do_n_stuff
    print('Progress report...')
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Something like that ? :</p>

<pre><code>for n in xrange(1000000,11000000,1000000):
    for i in xrange(n-1000000,n):
        x = 10/2
    print 'Progress at '+str(i)
</code></pre>

<p>result</p>

<pre><code>Progress at 999999
Progress at 1999999
Progress at 2999999
Progress at 3999999
Progress at 4999999
Progress at 5999999
Progress at 6999999
Progress at 7999999
Progress at 8999999
Progress at 9999999
</code></pre>

<p>.</p>

<p>EDIT</p>

<p>Better:</p>

<pre><code>for n in xrange(0,10000000,1000000):
    for i in xrange(n,n+1000000):
        x = 10/2
    print 'Progress at '+str(i)
</code></pre>

<p>And inspired from pajton:</p>

<pre><code>m = 1000000
for n in xrange(0,10*m,m):
    for i in xrange(n,n+m):
        x = 10/2
    print 'Progress at '+str(i+1)
</code></pre>

<p>I prefer this that I find more immediately readable than the pajton's solution.
It keeps the display of a value depending of <strong>i</strong></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>It's fast enough that I wouldn't worry about it.</p>

<p>If you really wanted to speed it up, you could do this to avoid the modulus</p>

<pre><code>if (n == 1000000):
    n = 0
    print('Progress report...')
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>It's difficult to know how your system will optimize your code without testing. </p>

<p>You could simplify the relational part by realizing that zero is evaluated as false.</p>

<pre><code>if(not N % 10000000)
   do stuff
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>This makes the inner loop lean, and <code>m</code> does not have to be divisible by <code>interval</code>.</p>

<pre><code>m = 10000000
interval = 1000000
i = 0
while i &lt; m:
    checkpoint = min(m, i+interval)
    for j in xrange(i, checkpoint):
        #do something
    i = checkpoint
    print "progress"
</code></pre>
