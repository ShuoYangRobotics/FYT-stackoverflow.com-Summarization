<h3>Question (ID-34328):</h3><h2>How do I make Windows aware of a service I have written in Python?</h2><p>In <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32404/can-i-run-a-python-script-as-a-service-in-windows-how" rel="nofollow" title="Python scripts as Windows service">another question</a> I posted yesterday, I got very good advice on how a Python script could be run as a service in Windows. What I'm left wondering is: How is Windows aware of the services that can be managed in the native tools ("services" window in "administrative tools"). I. e. what is the Windows equivalent of putting a start/stop script in /etc/init.d under Linux?</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>As with most "aware" things in Windows, the answer is "Registry".</p>

<p>Take a look at this Microsoft Knowledge Base article: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/103000" rel="nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/103000</a></p>

<p>Search for "A Win32 program that can be started by the Service Controller and that obeys the service control protocol." This is the kind of service you're interested in.</p>

<p>The service registration (contents of KEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
\myservice) carries information about the service, including things like its executable location, what to do when it fails (halt the OS?), what services must be started before this one, what user it runs as.</p>

<p>As to service control protocol, main() of your program is supposed to invoke a Windows API call, setting up callbacks for start, stop, pause for your service. What you do in those callbacks is all up to you.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Don't muck with the registry directly. User the SC command-line tool. Namely, SC CREATE</p>

<p>I am using this method to run tracd (a python script / server) for trac. </p>

<p>Here are some very clear instructions: <a href="http://www.tacktech.com/display.cfm?ttid=197" rel="nofollow">http://www.tacktech.com/display.cfm?ttid=197</a></p>

<p>It does require some registry editing (very minimal and easy) but will allow you to make any command line / script a windows service. </p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>web2py can run as a windows service. It may help you to look into web2y/gluon/winservice.py.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>A well written service (and most services written as described in the links posted by Espo) are auto-registering, that meaning that when passed "install" on the command line, they should register themselves.</p>
