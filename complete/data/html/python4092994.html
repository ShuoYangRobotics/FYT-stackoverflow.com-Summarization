<h3>Question (ID-4092994):</h3><h2>Unable to install matplotlib on Mac OS X</h2><p>I'm trying to install matplotlib for graphing applications in Python on Mac OS X.  When I run "python setup.py install", it gives me this load of errors: <a href="http://pastebin.com/u7fL37ic" rel="nofollow">http://pastebin.com/u7fL37ic</a>.</p>

<p>A quick snippet:</p>

<p>I installed freetype using MacPorts, and I thought that would fix the issue, but no luck.  Gives me same error as before.  It looks like it can't find the right freetype files:</p>

<p>Where should I put the freetype files so that they can be found?  Right now they're in /opt/local/lib</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>you may also consider using the Enthought distribution (which comes even free for non-commercial usage)
It comes fully installed without any difficulty

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Here's how I did it:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo make -f make.osx fetch deps mpl_build mpl_install
</code></pre>

<p>This will install it in <code>/lib/python2.6/site-packages</code>, just move its contents to <code>/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/</code> for consistency.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I was given a new work computer recently (MacBook Pro OS 10.6.5), and wanted to install numpy + scipy + matplotlib in a Python virtual environment.  I'm not an expert, but the virtual environment seems to allow you to install packages such that they are isolated from the system-wide packages, essentially by redefining the system path in a clever way.  So, for one project I am working on that requires certain versions of these packages, I can install them once and do all of my work for that project there, independently of other changes I make outside the environment.  </p>

<p>After a lot of trial and error, I was able to build a virtual environment with Numpy 1.5.1, Scipy 0.8.0, and Matplotlib 1.0.0 all running flawlessly.  Here's how:</p>

<p>First, install the following four packages:</p>

<ul>
<li>freetype-2.4.4</li>
<li>libpng , version 1.4.5 found at <a href="http://ethan.tira-thompson.org/Mac_OS_X_Ports.html" rel="nofollow">http://ethan.tira-thompson.org/Mac_OS_X_Ports.html</a>.  Installation of matplotlib failed when I tried to install 1.5.0 from source! </li>
<li>pkg-config , version 0.23 </li>
<li>virtualenv for Python2.6</li>
</ul>

<p>(I'm a new user so I can't post links to these, sorry!).</p>

<p>If you install from source, use a standard install:</p>

<ul>
<li>$ ./configure</li>
<li>$ make</li>
<li>$ sudo make install</li>
</ul>

<p>Next, download the source files for numpy, scipy, and matplotlib.</p>

<p>Now it's time to create a virtual environment in folder TESTENV:</p>

<p>$ virtualenv /path/to/dir/TESTENV</p>

<p>Activate the virtual environment:</p>

<p>$ source . /path/to/dir/TESTENV/bin/activate</p>

<p>Now, python packages will be installed within TESTENV as if it were the root installation directory.  What worked for me was to execute:</p>

<p>$ python setupegg.py install</p>

<p>in the numpy, scipy, and matplotlib source folders (in that order).</p>

<p>Hope that helps!</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I would highly recommend the <a href="http://stronginference.com/scipy-superpack/" rel="nofollow">StrongInference Scipy Superpack</a>. It works with the built-in Apple supplied Python on 10.6 Snow Leopard. It's friendly to both 32-bit and 64-bit installs. It does not require installing a separate Python distribution or package managers like Macports or Fink.</p>

<p>Use it by first downloading the shell script from <a href="http://stronginference.com/scipy-superpack/" rel="nofollow">this page</a>. Then:</p>

<pre><code>sh superpack_10.6_2011.03.07.sh
</code></pre>

<p>or replace <code>superpack_10.6_2011.03.07.sh</code> with the name of the latest shell script as they update it from time to time.</p>

<p>To use it, make sure you type in ipython and not python!</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I followed this <a href="http://www.thisisthegreenroom.com/2011/installing-python-numpy-scipy-matplotlib-and-ipython-on-lion/" rel="nofollow">page's instructions</a>. I got stuck at </p>

<pre><code>pip install -e git+https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib#egg=matplotlib-dev
</code></pre>

<p>Then I did:</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib.git
cd matplotlib
python setup.py build
python setup.py install
</code></pre>

<p>Checked my installation by typing in terminal:</p>

<pre><code>python
import matplotlib
print matplotlib.__version__
print matplotlib.__file__
</code></pre>

<p>I got version 0.10.0 dev (as of this writing) and path /usr/local/Cellar/...</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I like using the brew, and none of the top three explanations worked or were enticing to me. However, I did look some more, and found this brew friendly explanation and solution:</p>

<p><a href="https://jholewinski.wordpress.com/2011/07/21/installing-matplotlib-on-os-x-10-7-with-homebrew" rel="nofollow">https://jholewinski.wordpress.com/2011/07/21/installing-matplotlib-on-os-x-10-7-with-homebrew</a></p>

<p>Summary: libpng on Snow Leopard isn't on friendly terms with matplotlib. You can manually install the un-released matplotlib to work around it:</p>

<pre><code>brew install python
brew install gfortran
brew install pkg-config
easy_install pip
pip install numpy
git clone https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib.git
cd matplotlib
python setup.py build
python setup.py install
</code></pre>
