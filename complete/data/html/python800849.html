<h3>Question (ID-800849):</h3><h2>Nice IDE for wxPython or Tkinter GUI Development</h2><p>I've had a little experience developing small command-line apps with Python, I want to move on to developing GUI's with Python, from all the GUI frameworks for Python the ones I feel most inclined to are wxPython and Tkinter but I don't want to code all the GUI by myself at this time.</p>

<p>Is there any good GUI IDE for any of this frameworks? It doesn't need to be free or open source as I'm willing to pay, as long as it's worth the money.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I will talk only about WxPython because it's the only toolkit I have experience with. TkInter is nice to write small programs (then it doesn't require a GUI Designer), but is not really appropriate for large application development.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://wxformbuilder.org" rel="nofollow">wxFormBuilder</a> is really good. But it generates only .XRC files you need to load in your program. And this becomes a little tricky. (<strong>Edit</strong>: wxFormBuilder can generate .py files directly now, and just need to subclass them when you use)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.dialogblocks.com/" rel="nofollow">DialogBlocks</a> and <a href="http://www.roebling.de/" rel="nofollow">wxDesigner</a> are two commercial software which can generate Python code directly. I didn't tested these much because of their price.</li>
<li>wxGlade is I think not yet mature enough for large programs, but it's worth a try.</li>
</ul>

<p>After trying all these, I realized they had all flaws and that nothing is better than just writing the GUI in an editor. The problem is the extended learning curve. But then you will be much more faster and your code will be much more flexible than when using a GUI designer.</p>

<p>Have a look at this <a href="http://wiki.wxpython.org/wxPythonPit%20Apps" rel="nofollow">list of major applications</a> written with wxpython. You will probably see that none of these use a GUI Designer, there must be a reason for this.
You then understand <strong>gs</strong> is right when saying that either you switch to PyQt or you write your application by hand. I had a look at Qt Designer in the past and thought this was what I needed. Unfortunately PyQt has some license restrictions.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>This may not answer your question directly, but I chose <a href="http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro" rel="nofollow">PyQt</a> because there were no good UI designers for wxPython.</p>

<p>It seems like either you write your UIs by hand or switch to PyQt.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong><br />
Because Nokia and Riverbankcomputing couldn't agree on a LGPL solution Nokia decided to build its own bindings: <a href="http://www.pyside.org/" rel="nofollow">PySide</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><a href="http://boa-constructor.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">Boa Constructor </a> has a WxPython GUI builder.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I use xrced (comes with wxPython). The GUI is defined in xml files, you have an autogenerated python file that automates some initialization then you subclass those autogenerated classes and do the rest of the initialization by hand. I find that this is a good way to blend the elegance of hand-written GUI code with ease of GUI code generation.</p>

<p>For the code I use <a href="http://www.wingware.com/" rel="nofollow">WingIDE</a>, it's helpfull to have a good debuger and good source code completion when dealing with large libraries (or frameworks if you will) like wxPython.</p>

<p>If you want more automation (and so, uglier code) try the latest version of <a href="http://boa-constructor.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">Boa</a>, there are some nice introductory screencasts for it at <a href="http://showmedo.com/videos/series?name=wKQrywla5" rel="nofollow">ShowMeDo.com</a></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I've used wxGlade for a few mission-critical apps. If you're a little weak in wx, it can be rough, but once you get used to it, its a great tool.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Try <a href="http://visualwx.altervista.org/" rel="nofollow">VisualWx</a>. I think the GUI designer is very good; however the IDE is fairly rudimentary (no code completion, debugging, etc.). My work pattern is to have VisualWx and a good editor like Komodo Edit/Netbeans/etc. open at the same time and switch between them as needed. </p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Not really a GUI IDE but it leds you define Tkinter GUIs in a JSON file: <a href="https://github.com/tmetsch/pytkgen" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/tmetsch/pytkgen</a></p>
