<h3>Question (ID-5544549):</h3><h2>Combining multiple for loops in Python</h2><p>Let's say, we have and list of objects in variable called "articles", each object has a member "tags" (which is simple list).</p>

<p>Expected output: all tags in all articles, joined in a single list.</p>

<p>In multiple lines, solution would be:</p>

<pre><code>arr = []
for article in articles:
    for tag in article.tags:
       arr.append(tag)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, how can we write this in single line instead of 4?</p>

<p>This syntax is invalid:</p>

<pre><code>arr = [tag for tag in article.tags for article in articles]
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks!</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>It's invalid because <code>article</code> doesn't exist by the time the first loop is parsed.</p>

<pre><code>arr = [tag for article in articles for tag in article.tags]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Perhaps</p>

<pre><code>arr = [tag for tag in (a.tags for a in articles)]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You are actually looping in the order that you don't want to order:</p>

<p>what you want is:</p>

<pre><code>result = [ tag for article in articles for tag in article.tags ]
</code></pre>

<p>To translate what you were doing in your example would be:</p>

<pre><code>for tag in article.tags:
    for article in articles:
       #code
</code></pre>

<p>which doesn't make much sense.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Try this:</p>

<pre><code>import itertools
it = itertools.chain.from_iterable(article.tags for article in articles)
l  = list(it) # if you really need a list and not an iterator
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>If you want <em>unique</em> tags, you might be better served by</p>

<pre><code>import operator
tags = reduce(operator.__or__, (set(article.tags) for article in articles), set())
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>For Python 3, you would need to</p>

<pre><code>from functools import reduce
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>The initializer <code>set()</code> is returned if the sequence is empty, rather than throwing an error.</p></li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>This is already answered multiple times, but it can be helpful to break lines and indent:</p>

<pre><code>arr = [tag 
       for article in articles
           for tag in article.tags]
</code></pre>

<p>This has the advantage of </p>

<ol>
<li>Making it more readable if you needed to do some kind of projection on tag (like getting <code>(tag.name, tag.description, tag.count)</code> or some other tuple or transformation of a tag) </li>
<li>Making the syntax for nested generator expressions more readable to a beginner</li>
<li>Making complex nested generator expressions more readable</li>
</ol>
