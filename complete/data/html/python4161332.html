<h3>Question (ID-4161332):</h3><h2>How can I include python script in a HTML file?</h2><p>How do I put this python script:</p>

<pre><code>a = ['f','d','s','a']
x = -1
scope = vars()
for i in a:
    scope['x']+=1
    print a[x]
</code></pre>

<p>inside of a html file.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>If your web server supports it, you could run it as a CGI script to output an HTML file - more information here: <a href="http://www.penzilla.net/tutorials/python/cgi/" rel="nofollow">http://www.penzilla.net/tutorials/python/cgi/</a></p>

<p>You would need to modify your script to ouput valid HTML, but that tutorial should get you started.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Something like this, if you want to create an html, not necessarily display it:</p>

<pre><code> html_file = open('namehere.html','w')
 a = ['f','d','s','a']
 x = -1
 scope = vars()
 data = ''
 for i in a: #TIP: use a generator
     scope['x']+=1
     data += a[x]
     data += '\n'
 html_file.write(data)
 html_file.close()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>if the script is in a server , you can run it using remote funcion call through JSON-RPC<br>
you may refer the <a href="http://json-rpc.org/" rel="nofollow">JSON-RPC documentation here</a></p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Surround it with a <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag and you're golden.</p>

<p>But seriously, I think what you are trying to do is print fdsa, which would would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
fdsa
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>What you have there is not really a python script.  You might need to correct that first, and then give a little more explanation what you are trying to do.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Perhaps CGI is what you are looking for:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.penzilla.net/tutorials/python/cgi/" rel="nofollow">http://www.penzilla.net/tutorials/python/cgi/</a></p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>print "Content-Type: text/html"     # HTML is following
print                               # blank line, end of headers

print "&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;pre&gt;"
a = ['f','d','s','a']
x = -1
scope = vars()
for i in a:
    scope['x']+=1
    print a[x]
print "&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps.  Good luck!</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Not possible. Python isn't like PHP; I can't just do this</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
</code></pre>

<p>And be good to go.</p>

<p>However, if your web server has a Python interpreter (most all do, these days), you can write CGI (common gateway interface) scripts to make Python code run on your webpage.</p>

<p>If you're trying to generate dynamic content (like change words in HTML), Javascript or PHP is better. Python is more suited to web applications.</p>
