<h3>Question (ID-591839):</h3><h2>Is there a python equivalent of the prefuse visualization toolkit?</h2><p>The <a href="http://prefuse.org/" rel="nofollow">prefuse visualization toolkit</a> is pretty nice, but for Java.  I was wondering if there was something similar for python.  My primary interest is being able to navigate dynamic graphs.</p>

<p>Something along the lines of:</p>

<p>Add prefuse to your path:</p>

<p><code>export JYTHONPATH=$JYTHONPATH:prefuse.jar</code></p>

<p>and</p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import prefuse</code></p>

<p>from your jython machinery</p>

<p>this <a href="http://github.com/fajran" rel="nofollow">guy</a> has an example of using prefuse from jython <a href="http://gist.github.com/32288" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You might want to check out <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/rasmus/summon/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">SUMMON</a>, a visualization system that uses python but handles fairly large data sets.  There's an impressive video of visualizing and navigating a massive tree.  (Can't post the link because I'm a first time poster.  It's on the SUMMON front page.)</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If you're using a Mac, check out <a href="http://nodebox.net/code/index.php/Home" rel="nofollow">NodeBox</a>. One extension it offers is a <a href="http://nodebox.net/code/index.php/Graphing" rel="nofollow">graph library</a> that looks pretty good. Poke around in the <a href="http://nodebox.net/code/index.php/Gallery" rel="nofollow">NodeBox gallery</a> some to find something similar to your problem and it should have some helpful links.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>This is well after OP, but just in case:</p>

<p><a href="http://dkbza.org/pydot.html" rel="nofollow">pydot</a>. Allows generation &amp; rendering of graphs.  If you need graph algorithms (transitive closure etc.) also look at pygraphlib which extends and integrates pydot.</p>

<p>Note that neither allows interactive editing of the rendered diagram.  They both use graphviz to generate output.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Note that prefuse now has the <a href="http://flare.prefuse.org/" rel="nofollow">flare</a> package which uses flash.  </p>

<p>Connect that to a Python backend via <a href="http://mdp.cti.depaul.edu/" rel="nofollow">web2py</a> and you've got a great web app (just an idea).</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You could try using prefuse with <a href="http://jpype.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">JPype</a>, if you can't find a suitable replacement.</p>
