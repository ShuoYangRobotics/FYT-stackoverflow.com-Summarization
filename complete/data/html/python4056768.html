<h3>Question (ID-4056768):</h3><h2>How to declare array of zeros in python (or an array of a certain size)</h2><p>I am trying to build a histogram of counts... so I create buckets.
I know I could just go through and append a bunch of zeros i.e something along these lines:</p>

<pre><code>buckets = [];
for i in xrange(0,100):
    buckets.append(0);
</code></pre>

<p>is there a  more elegant way to do it? I feel like there should be a way to just declare an array of a certain size.</p>

<p>I know numpy has numpy.zeros but I want the more general solution</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>As this is the first result on Google and here for some searches, I'd like to include same declaration, but for multidimensional array:</p>

<pre><code>buckets = [ [0] * 100 ] * 100
</code></pre>

<p>it's a 100x100 array filled with zero's</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>buckets = [0]*100</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The simplest solution would be</p>

<pre><code>"\x00" * size # for a buffer of binary zeros
[0] * size # for a list of integer zeros
</code></pre>

<p>In general you should use more pythonic code like list comprehension (in your example: <code>[0 for unused in xrange(100)]</code>) or using <code>string.join</code> for buffers.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>use numpy</p>

<pre><code>import numpy
zarray = numpy.zeros(100)
</code></pre>

<p>And then use the <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.histogram.html" rel="nofollow">Histogram</a> library function</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Just for completeness: To declare a multidimensional list of zeros in python you have to use a list comprehension like this:</p>

<pre><code>buckets = [[0 for col in range(5)] for row in range(10)]
</code></pre>

<p>to avoid reference sharing between the rows.</p>

<p>This looks more clumsy than chester1000's code, but is essential if the values are supposed to be changed later. See the <a href="http://docs.python.org/faq/programming.html#how-do-i-create-a-multidimensional-list" rel="nofollow">Python FAQ</a> for more details.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Depending on what you're actually going to do with the data after it's collected, collections.defaultdict(int) might be useful.</p>
