<h3>Question (ID-2473760):</h3><h2>Python 'datetime.datetime' object is unsubscriptable</h2><p>First, I am NOT a python developer. I am trying to fix an issue within a python script that is being executed from the command line. This script was written by someone who is no longer around, and no longer willing to help with issues. </p>

<p>This is python 2.5, and for the moment it cannot be upgraded. Here are the lines of code in question:</p>

<pre><code>    start_time = datetime.strptime(str(paf.Start),"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
    dict_start = datetime(*start_time[:6])

    end_time = datetime.strptime(str(paf.End),"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
    dict_end = datetime(*end_time[:6])
</code></pre>

<p>When this code is ran, it generates an error with the description: 'datetime.datetime' object is unsubscriptable.</p>

<p>This is the import statement:</p>

<pre><code>from datetime import datetime
</code></pre>

<p>I have a feeling that this is something simple, but not being my native language and Google not yielding any valuable results, I am stuck. I have tried a couple of different import methods, yielding different errors, but all with these statements. Any help on this would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>It looks like you just want the time right?  The datetime.strptime method returns a 'datetime' object and as such the following attributes contain the time: datetime.day, datetime.hour, datetime.year, etc.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Robert, try replacing</p>

<pre><code>dict_start = datetime(*start_time[:6])
</code></pre>

<p>with</p>

<pre><code>dict_start = start_time
</code></pre>

<p>and </p>

<pre><code>dict_end = datetime(*end_time[:6])
</code></pre>

<p>with </p>

<pre><code>dict_end = end_time
</code></pre>

<p>It looks silly, but perhaps try it anyway. My reason is this: <code>datetime.strptime</code> returns a <code>datetime.datetime</code> object. Since the code originally says</p>

<pre><code>dict_start = datetime(*start_time[:6])
</code></pre>

<p>it appears that <code>dict_start</code> is intended to also be a <code>datetime.datetime</code>, with the same 6 fields (year,month,day,hour,minutes,seconds). So try</p>

<pre><code>dict_start = start_time
</code></pre>

<p>If that doesn't work, you might have to show us more of the code so we can form a better guess as to what was intended.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> The easiest way to get at the individual fields (year,month,day,hour,minutes,seconds) is to use the dot notation to access the attributes. For example,</p>

<pre><code>(start_time.year,start_time.month,start_time.day)
</code></pre>

<p>gives a 3-tuple with the year, month, and day as integers.</p>

<p>PS. For more info about datetime objects, see <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/datetime.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/library/datetime.html</a>. It may contain useful examples for you.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Looks like the <code>datetime.strptime</code> call was actually meant to be a call to <code>time.strptime</code> (with a separate <code>import time</code> at the start of the module) -- the latter call would indeed return a subscriptable, tuple-like object, and the idiom</p>

<pre><code>xx = time.strptime(...)
yy = datetime.datetime(x[:6])
</code></pre>

<p>(with <code>import time</code> and <code>import datetime</code> at the start of the module, of course) was indeed the canonical way to parse a string into a <code>datetime.datetime</code> instance before the <code>datetime.datetime</code> type added its own <code>strptime</code> function which basically does just this job. So, it looks like "imperfectly migrated" code.</p>

<p>To extract just the date (as a <code>datetime.date</code> object, with just year, month and day -- no hours, minutes, seconds and fractions) from a <code>datetime.datetime</code> instance <code>x</code>, call <code>x.date()</code> which will return the desired date object (not modify <code>x</code> itself of course: datetime objects are immutable -- you always make new ones, not change existing ones).</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Observations:</p>

<p>Whoever wrote the code didn't test it; it never could have run properly.</p>

<p>Whoever wrote it was confusing datetime.datetime.strptime with time.strptime.</p>

<p>Once upon a time (pun intended) datetime.datetime.strptime didn't exist. One had to do something like the following: </p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from datetime import datetime
&gt;&gt;&gt; import time
&gt;&gt;&gt; time_tuple = time.strptime("2010-03-19 13:22:45","%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
&gt;&gt;&gt; time_tuple
(2010, 3, 19, 13, 22, 45, 4, 78, -1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; datetime(*time_tuple[:6])
datetime.datetime(2010, 3, 19, 13, 22, 45)
</code></pre>

<p>(The <code>[:6]</code> was a dead give-away)</p>

<p>Now one can do this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from datetime import datetime
&gt;&gt;&gt; datetime.strptime("2010-03-19 13:22:45","%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
datetime.datetime(2010, 3, 19, 13, 22, 45)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Its not the import fault. Its the *start_time[:6]  *end_time[:6] that Python doesn't like. Replace it</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>The following code doesn't make sense to me:</p>

<pre><code>start_time = datetime.strptime(str(paf.Start),"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
dict_start = datetime(*start_time[:6])
</code></pre>

<p>If you need a tuple mapping in dict_start, then use something like this:</p>

<pre><code>start_time = datetime.strptime(str(paf.Start),"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
dict_start = start_time.timetuple()[:6]
</code></pre>

<p>If you need dict, then:</p>

<pre><code>start_time = datetime.strptime(str(paf.Start),"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
dict_start = dict(zip(('year', 'month' ,'day', 'hour', 'minute', 'second'), start_time.timetuple()[:6]))
</code></pre>

<p>-- or use paf.Start, if possible. Also, I'm not sure but it could be that <em>('year', 'month' ,'day', 'hour', 'minute', 'second')</em> tuple is predefined somewhere in Python std lib or it can be easily replaced with some other construct, but it's midnight here and I don't see any other obvious solution.</p>
