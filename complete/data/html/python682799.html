<h3>Question (ID-682799):</h3><h2>What to do with "The input line is too long" error message?</h2><p>I am trying to use os.system() to call another program that takes an input and an output file. The command I use is ~250 characters due to the long folder names. </p>

<p>When I try to call the command, I'm getting an error: <code>The input line is too long</code>.</p>

<p>I'm guessing there's a <code>255 character limit</code> (its built using a C system call, but I couldn't find the limitations on that either).</p>

<p>I tried changing the directory with <code>os.chdir()</code> to reduce the folder trail lengths, but when I try using <code>os.system()</code> with <code>"..\folder\filename"</code> it apparently can't handle relative path names. Is there any way to get around this limit or get it to recognize relative paths?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You should use the subprocess module instead.  See <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/subprocess.html#subprocess-replacements" rel="nofollow">this</a> little doc for how to rewrite os.system calls to use subprocess.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Even it's a good idea to use <code>subprocess.Popen()</code>, this does not solve the issue.</p>

<p><strong>Your problem is not the 255 characters limit</strong>, this was true on DOS times, later increased to 2048 for Windows NT/2000, and increased again to 8192 for Windows XP+.</p>

<p>The <strong>real solution</strong> is to workaround a very old bug in Windows APIs: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/96ayss4b.aspx" rel="nofollow">_popen() and _wpopen()</a>. </p>

<p>If you ever use quotes during the command line you have to add the entire command in quoates or you will get the <code>The input line is too long</code> error message.</p>

<p>All Microsoft operating systems starting with Windows XP had a 8192 characters limit which is now enough for any decent command line usage but they forgot to solve this bug. </p>

<p>To overcome their bug <strong>just include your entire command in double quotes</strong>, and if you want to know more real the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/96ayss4b.aspx" rel="nofollow">MSDN comment on _popen()</a>. </p>

<p>Be careful because these works:</p>

<pre><code>prog
"prog"
""prog" param"
""prog" "param""
</code></pre>

<p>But these will not work:</p>

<pre><code>""prog param""
</code></pre>

<p>If you need a function that does add the quotes when they are needed you can take the one from <a href="http://github.com/ssbarnea/tendo/blob/master/tendo/tee.py" rel="nofollow">http://github.com/ssbarnea/tendo/blob/master/tendo/tee.py</a></p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You should use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/subprocess.html" rel="nofollow">subprocess</a> instead of os.system.</p>

<p>subprocess has the advantage of being able to change the directory for you:</p>

<pre><code>import subprocess
my_cwd = r"..\folder\"
my_process = subprocess.Popen(["command name", "option 1", "option 2"], cwd=my_cwd)
my_process.wait() # wait for process to end
if my_process.returncode != 0:
    print "Something went wrong!"
</code></pre>

<p>The subprocess module contains some helper functions as well if the above looks a bit verbose.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Assuming you're using windows, from the backslashes, you could write a .bat file from python and then <code>os.system()</code> on that.  It's a hack.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Make sure when you're using '\' in your strings that they're being properly escaped.</p>

<p>Python uses the '\' as the escape character, so the string <code>"..\folder\filename"</code> evaluates to <code>"..folderfilename"</code> since an escaped f is still an f.</p>

<p>You probably want to use</p>

<pre><code>r"..\folder\filename"
</code></pre>

<p>or </p>

<pre><code>"..\\folder\\filename"
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I got the same message but it was strange because the command was not that long (130 characters) and it used to work, it just stopped working one day.
I just closed the command window and opened a new one and it worked.
I have had the command window opened for a long time (maybe months, it's a remote virtual machine).
I guess is some windows bug with a buffer or something.</p>
