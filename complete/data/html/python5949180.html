<h3>Question (ID-5949180):</h3><h2>Is there a more efficient one liner to initialize a variable based on a condition?</h2><p>Can the <code>atype</code> variable be initialized via a one liner ?</p>

<pre><code>def detect(dt,result):
    """ prints the type of date """
    atype = 'unknown'
    if 'greg' in result:
        atype = 'Gregorian'
    elif 'eth' in result:
        atype = 'Ethiopian'

    print '%s is in %s format.' % (dt,atype)

<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You could use a pair of conditional expressions — and no parenthesis are necessary at all; just like Python knows that <code>1 + 2 + 3</code> should be done reasonably from left-to-right, so conditional expressions can be written with one clause after another without any fear of the interpreter getting confused. Line breaks and indentation are important for readability, however, so I generally do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>atype = ('Gregorian' if 'greg' in result
         else 'Ethiopian' if 'eth' in result
         else 'unknown')
</code></pre>

<p>This form of indentation is not only the one that most editors will produce in any case if you press "enter" before each <code>else</code>, but it makes a great deal of visual sense to me when I come back later and read my own, or someone else's, code ­— which is, after all, a big reason we use Python, right? :)</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Of course I realize that this is a one-liner only in the sense that Python sees the continued line as a single line of code; so I guess my answer is that your program would seem a bit dense to me as one <em>physical</em> line of Python, but works quite nicely to my eyes if written as one <em>logical</em> line of Python!</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> One further note: of course, I recognize that my code snippet violates PEP-8, which says to end continued lines with operators — so PEP-8 would have me move the <code>else</code> words up to the ends of the previous lines. I can only say that this is one of the rules of PEP-8 that I disagree with, which I regularly break, and that therefore I produce more readable code as a result. I think my difference with PEP-8 on this point comes from having a math typesetting background, and, as Donald Knuth emphasizes in the TeXBook, “displayed formulas always break <em>before</em> binary operations and relations” (p.195).</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Not sure if this is meaningful and readable...</p>

<pre><code>atype = 'Gregorian' if 'greg' in result else ('Ethiopian' if 'eth' in result else 'unknown')
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Personally, on a forum, I propose</p>

<pre><code>def detect(dt,result):
    """ prints the type of date """
    style = 'Gregorian' if 'greg' in result else\
            'Ethiopian' if 'eth'  in result else\
            'unknown'
    print '%s is in %s format.' % (dt,style)
</code></pre>

<p>and in the secret of my codes where nobody will come to see if I respect the Zen of Python, I would do in fact:</p>

<pre><code>def detect(dt,result):
    """ prints the type of date """
    print dt + ' is in %s format.'\
          % \
          'Gregorian' if 'greg' in result else\
          'Ethiopian' if 'eth'  in result else\
          'unknown'
</code></pre>

<p>I measured execution's times: the second runs in 89 % of the time of the first </p>

<p>.</p>

<h2>EDIT 1</h2>

<p>The test I conducted didn't satisfy me, in the end, because it isn't fair to compare a program in which an assignement is done (style = etc) to a program in which there is no equivalent assignement.</p>

<p>So I tested again, with modified codes.To accentuate the influence of differences between the codes, I added some lines of conditions. </p>

<p>I ran the following programs separately (to avoid possible persistence of objects that would be reassigned without having to be re-created; I don't precisely know what happens in the memory and the object model of Python, and if it may happen in fact; but I sometimes observe strange phenomenons when I measure execution's time. So I take no risk, I separate the codes)</p>

<p>Conclusions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>there is no difference between the way of writing the code with if-elif-else conditions or with if-else-else-else successive conditions. </p>

<p>Then, even if the second manner isn't so atrocious than delnan think, it is slightly less immediately understandable, so I finally find that the first manner of writing is better than the second one because of the perfect readibility, without loosing any amount of performance.</p>

<p>Use of if-else-else is interesting and the only solution in certain cases, when it is impossible to use if-elif-else, for exemple in a list comprehension or to write a lambda function.</p></li>
<li><p>this time, my code runs in 64 % the time of the two other execution's times. The more there are conditions to examine, the faster is my code</p>

<p>If someone is concerned by performance, this solution is the one to use. If not, a succession of if-elif-else conditions appears to me the best choice.</p></li>

<h2>EDIT 2</h2>

<p>@eat,</p>

<p>Suppose that a list of one million elements, like this one</p>

<pre><code>li = [('greg','Gregorian'),('eth','Ethiopian')]
</code></pre>

<p>has been recorded in serialized format with cPickle. Then the code will be:</p>

<pre><code>import cPickle  

with open('trynewline.txt','r') as f:
    li = cPickle.load(f)

def detect(dt,result):
    for a,b in li:
        if a in result:
            return '%s is in %s format.' % (dt,b)
        else:
            return '%s is in unknown format.' % dt
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>import cPickle  

with open('trynewline.txt','r') as f:
    li = cPickle.load(f)

def detect(dt,result):
    ha = [ b for a,b in li if a in result]
    y = dt + ' is in %s format.'\
        % (ha[0] if ha else 'unknown')
</code></pre>

<p>That's all. Anyway, the data contained in <strong>li</strong> must come from somewhere. It can be  automatically produced; or it is manually produced. If it is manually produced and nobody created before me, I will be obliged to write manually the one million conditions myself. And if it is you that will have to write the code, you will do that also. I don't see how you could avoid it with your dictionary.  </p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Yep, Python's variable's scope is a bit different than in other programming languages. 
So, </p>

<pre><code>if 'greg' in result:
    atype = 'Gregorian' 

print(atype)
</code></pre>

<p>Will do just fine. Also </p>

<pre><code>if 'greg' in result: atype = 'Gregorian'
print(atype)
</code></pre>

<p>Will work, unless it's a Python shell (you have to execute the whole script)</p>

<p>But anyway, it's a bad practice to make very long, condition-dependent variable initializations. </p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>actually strange but..it's just a different way to do it..I think it is easier to extend, but i guess there is a better way ;)</p>

<pre><code>import operator as op
import functools as fc

atype = {'greg':'Gregorian', 'eth':'Ethiopian'}.get(filter(fc.partial(op.contains, ('greg', 'eth')), res)[0], 'unknown')
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Although there's a separate line to set up a dictionary, here's an a one-liner (spread over two for readability):</p>

<pre><code>typemap = {'greg': 'Gregorian', 'eth': 'Ethiopian'}

atype = ([typemap[frag] for frag in typemap if frag in result][0]
         if any(frag in result for frag in typemap) else 'unknown')
</code></pre>
