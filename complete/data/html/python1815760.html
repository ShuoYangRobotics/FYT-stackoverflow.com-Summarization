<h3>Question (ID-1815760):</h3><h2>What's an easy way to implement a --quiet option in a python script</h2><p>Am working on a command line python script - throughout the script, I have a lot of information I am <code>print</code>-ing to the terminal window so that I may follow along with what is happening.</p>

<p>Using <code>OptionParser</code> I want to add a <code>--quiet</code> option so I can silence all the output.  I am looking for a pythonic way to go about implementing this throughout the script so that I <em>don't</em> end up doing something like:</p>

<pre><code>if not QUIET: # global variable set by OptionParser
    print " my output "
</code></pre>

<p>Am new to python and sure there is a better way.  Ideas?  </p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You could use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/logging.html" rel="nofollow"><code>logging</code></a> and assign those things that should not be printed if <code>QUIET</code> a different log level.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1815760/whats-an-easy-way-to-implement-a-quiet-option-in-a-python-script/1815802#1815802">THC4K's answer</a> shows an example of how to do this, assuming that all output should be silent if <code>QUIET</code> is set. Note that in Python 3 <code>from __future__ import print_function</code> is not necessary:</p>

<pre><code>print = logging.info
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.WARNING if QUIET else logging.INFO,
                    format="%(message)s")
</code></pre>

<p>For for important output that should not be silenced by <code>--quiet</code>, define e.g. <code>iprint</code>:</p>

<pre><code>iprint = logging.warning
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>can silence <strong>all</strong> the output by running it as <code>python myscript.py &gt; /dev/null</code></p>

<p>change the output streams in the script:</p>

<pre><code>if QUIET:
    sys.stdout = open(os.devnull,'a')
    sys.stderr = open(os.devnull,'a')
print something
</code></pre>

<p>use a different print function</p>

<pre><code>from __future__ import print_function
if QUIET:
    def print(*args):
        pass
print( something )
</code></pre>

<p>use logging and loglevels</p>

<pre><code>from __future__ import print_function
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format="%(message)s")
print = logging.info
if QUIET:
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.ERROR)

print( something )
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Why don't you just modify your output function based on whether the program is in quiet mode, so you only do the check once?</p>

<pre><code>if QUIET:
    def DoOutput(stuff):
        pass
else:
    def DoOutput(stuff):
        print(stuff)
</code></pre>

<p>Or, you could of course put the check for <code>QUIET</code> inside your output function:</p>

<pre><code>def DoOutput(stuff):
    if QUIET:
        print(stuff)
</code></pre>

<p>The situation that you've described is actually one of the reasons that Python 3 has changed <code>print</code> from a keyword to an actual function: people's large projects were becoming very dependent on <code>print</code> being a keyword, and then when it came time to modify how output was recorded, it required a massive refactoring; whereas when <code>print</code> is a proper function, you can just redefine it, so that <code>print(foo)</code> would output to a log file, for instance.  That's why it's better practice to wrap your output/logging in an actual function, rather than having <code>print</code> scattered about your script.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You could replace stdout with a proxy that filters calls to write or writelines:</p>

<pre><code>class FileProxy(object):
    def __init__(self, real_file, quiet_flag):
        self.real_file = real_file
        self.quiet_flag = quiet_flag

    def write(self, string):
        if not self.quiet_flag:
            self.real_file.write(string)

    def writelines(self, strings):
        if not self.quiet_flag:
            self.real_file.write(strings)

    def __getattr__(self, name):
        return getattr(self.file, name)

import sys
sys.stdout = FileProxy(sys.stdout, QUIET)
</code></pre>

<p>The advantage of this is that it is cross platform (unlike writing to /dev/null) and it will still work for print statements in third-party libraries that you do not have control over.
You could also refine it further to give more control over exactly what is written, e.g. to add a timestamp, or redirect print statements to the logging system.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>If you want it quick and dirty and you want to get rid of <em>all</em> output then redirect stdout and stderr to /dev/null. Put:</p>

<pre>sys.stdout = open("/dev/null", "a")
sys.stderr = open("/dev/null", "a")
</pre>

<p>At the point where you detect --quiet.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><pre><code>if QUIET:
   sys.stdout=open("/dev/null","w")
...
print 'my output'
</code></pre>

<p>On Windows,  use "nul" instead of "/dev/null"</p>
