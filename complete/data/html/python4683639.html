<h3>Question (ID-4683639):</h3><h2>Call a program written in python in a program written in Ocaml</h2><p>I wanted to ask if you could call in a program written in Ocaml a program written in python , and if the answer is yes how do I do?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>What exactly are you intending to do?  Do you want to run it and forget about it?  Then do a fork/exec.  Do you want run it and wait until it's finished but otherwise do nothing?  Then use <code>Sys.command</code>.  Do you want to read/write to it?  Then uses <code>Unix.open_process*</code> (or <code>Unix.create_process*</code>).</p>

<p>For example, if I want to run <code>ls</code> and print out the results, I can do this:</p>

<pre><code>let ls = Unix.open_process_in "ls"
try
  while true do
    Printf.printf "%s\n" (input_line ls)
  done
with End_of_file -&gt; ()
Unix.close_process_in ls
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Don't have any real life experience with this, but this sounds interesting (from the <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratingPythonWithOtherLanguages" rel="nofollow">Integrating Python with other languages wiki</a>):</p>

<p><em><a href="http://pycaml.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">Pycaml</a>: write Python extension modules in OCaml (instead of C), and use Python code and native libraries from OCaml programs.</em></p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You can execute commands using <code>Sys.command</code>, so you can just do <code>Sys.command "python foo.py"</code>, assuming python is in your path and foo.py is in the current directory.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>If your program is an executable (otherwise you would compile it ;) ) you can use the Unix module as you use it in C, for example :</p>

<pre><code>let program = "path_to_python_program_exe" in

match Unix.fork () with
    | 0 -&gt; (try
          Unix.execvp program [|program; "any_more_args_here"|]
       with
          _ -&gt; printf "%s" "error while execv\n"; exit (-1))
    | -1 -&gt; printf "%s" "error accured on fork\n"
    | _ -&gt; ignore (wait ()); printf "%s" "parent exit...\n"
</code></pre>

<p>When you compile, you use the unix.cma for the compiler: <code>ocamlc unix.cma you_ml.ml</code></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Looks like you can use the <a href="http://batteries.forge.ocamlcore.org/doc.preview%3abatteries-beta1/html/api/Shell.html" rel="nofollow">Shell library</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>It depends on your exact requirements, but you can use pythons os.system() to execute an program in the same way you would call it from the command line. That should be a good starting point.</p>
