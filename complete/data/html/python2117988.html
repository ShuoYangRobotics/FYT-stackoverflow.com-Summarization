<h3>Question (ID-2117988):</h3><h2>What IDE to use for Google App Engine development in Python?</h2><p>I'm trying to figure out what IDE to use for Google App Engine development in Python.  I'm completely new to Python, coming from a C#/.NET background.  </p>

<p>I initially went down the route of getting the Eclipse plugin for Google App Engine development only to find out it was for Java development only.  </p>

<p>Currently, I'm just using Notepad++ which, although a decent editor, I'm looking for a more full-blown IDE.  Maybe it's because I'm accustomed to Visual Studio when doing .NET development, but I figure there must be something better than just using Notepad++ to edit my Python/GAE code.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><a href="http://pydev.org/" rel="nofollow">PyDev</a> has support for GAE projects.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>James, I am also primarily a C#/Visual Studio guy, but I have gotten deeply into AppEngine devleopment over the past couple of years. The best IDE that I have found is <a href="http://www.wingware.com/">Wing IDE</a>. It's not Visual Studio, but it does a remarkably good job of imitating Intellisense and providing the very powerful debugging capabilities to which Visual Studio accustoms one.</p>

<p>It's not free, but I am sure that you will find it very worth your investment.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>My workhorse IDE is <a href="http://www.activestate.com/komodo_edit/" rel="nofollow">Komodo Edit</a>, Komodo IDE's free (both as in beer and as in speech) little brother. It works great with Python - automatically extracting autocomplete data from the source itself - just include the AppEngine directory and wait for it to scan the files.</p>

<p>Here's a good step-by-step guide configuring Komodo IDE for Google AppEngine development: <a href="http://www.toddnemet.com/using-komodo-edit-as-an-ide-for-google-app-engine/" rel="nofollow">using-komodo-edit-as-an-ide-for-google-app-engine.html</a></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Eclipse with pydev is ok, if you don't dabble in obscure SDKs (for some reason auto-completion seems hard to do in python, especially with precompiled python libraries).</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Actually you can use Eclipse+Python with the PyDev plugin. There is a tutorial <a href="http://daily.profeth.de/2008/04/google-app-engine-eclipse-pydev.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>There is <a href="http://www.aptana.org/" rel="nofollow">Aptana Studio</a>, although I haven't used it myself. I think it's based on Eclipse, so presumably it will use the PyDev plugin too.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.wingware.com/" rel="nofollow">Wing IDE</a> (<a href="https://wingware.com/store/purchase" rel="nofollow">paid</a>, but with <a href="https://wingware.com/wingide/features/101" rel="nofollow">free version</a>) does very good stuff for General Python and AppEngine! Give it a shot. </p>

<p>Free version doesn't support GAE debugging.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.activestate.com/komodo_edit/" rel="nofollow">Komodo Edit</a> it's a <a href="http://www.blogenough.com/blog/2008/04/19/using-komodo-edit-as-an-ide-for-google-app-engine.html" rel="nofollow">good</a> option</p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>Notice that if you right click the project node, you cannot see "Run as->PyDev: Google App Engine", but you can right click the src folder, it works.</p>
<br /><b>#10</b><br /><p>I like Eclipse+Python with the PyDev plugin but Wing IDE feels so nice when coding - i would love to look at Komodo IDE i like it for PHP . </p>
<br /><b>#11</b><br /><p>I can't recommend PyCharm enough. I think that this is the kind of neat and clean development experience you are looking for : <a href="http://www.basarat.com/2011/06/google-app-engine-python-pycharm-love.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.basarat.com/2011/06/google-app-engine-python-pycharm-love.html</a> <br> I am a C# guy and I know exactly what you mean when you say Visual Studio. This is as close as it gets to the best possible experience on Google App Engine. I have tried the alternatives and I have had good python programming experiences on all of them. But for google app engine this is my bet. </p>
<br /><b>#12</b><br /><p>I'd like to recommend <a href="http://netbeans.org/downloads/6.9.1/" rel="nofollow">netbean 6.9</a> + 'python' addon. </p>

<p><em>Notes: At this time netbean 7.0 released but python addon not updates</em></p>
<br /><b>#13</b><br /><p>You can try appengine-emacs-toolkit. <a href="http://code.google.com/p/appengine-emacs-toolkit/" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/appengine-emacs-toolkit/</a></p>

<p>This toolkit contains two emacs major mode which help to develop GoogleAppEngine and SinaAppEngine with python.</p>

<p>It provides support for <em>create new project</em>, <em>launch local server</em>, <em>open browser to view project</em>, <em>upload project</em>.</p>

<p>This toolkit tested on WindowsXP/7, Ubuntu with GoogleAppEngine-1.6.1, saepythondevguide.</p>
