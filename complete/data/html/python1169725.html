<h3>Question (ID-1169725):</h3><h2>Adding Values From Tuples of Same Length</h2><p>In a graphical program I'm writing using pygame I use a tuple representing a coordinate like this: (50, 50).</p>

<p>Sometimes, I call a function which returns another tuple such as (3, -5), which represents the change in coordinate.</p>

<p>What is the best way to add the change value to the coordinate value. It would be nice if I could do something like coordinate += change, but it appears that would simply concatenate the two tuples to something like (50, 50, 3, -5). Rather than adding the 1st value to the 1st value and the 2nd to the 2nd, and returning a resulting tuple.</p>

<p>Until now I've been using this rather tiresome method:
coord = (coord[0] + change[0], coord[1] + change[1])</p>

<p>What is a better, more concise method to add together the values of two tuples of the same length. It seems especially important to know how to do it if the tuples are of an arbitrary length or a particularly long length that would make the previous method even more tiresome.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Well, one way would be</p>

<pre><code>coord = tuple(sum(x) for x in zip(coord, change))
</code></pre>

<p>If you are doing a lot of math, you may want to investigate using <a href="http://numpy.scipy.org/" rel="nofollow">NumPy</a>, which has much more powerful array support and better performance.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>List comprehension is probably more readable, but here's another way:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = (1,2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = (3,4)
&gt;&gt;&gt; tuple(map(sum,zip(a,b)))
(4,6)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>This is a work in progress as I am learning Python myself. Can we use classes here, could simplify some operations later. I propose to use a coord class to store the coordinates. It would override add and sub so you could do addition and subtraction by simply using operators + and -. You could get the tuple representation with a function built into it.</p>

<p><strong>Class</strong></p>

<pre><code>class coord(object):    
    def __init__(self,x,y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __add__(self,c):
        return coord(self.x + c.x, self.y + c.y)

    def __sub__(self,c):
        return coord(self.x - c.x, self.y - c.y)

    def __eq__(self,c): #compares two coords
        return self.x == c.x and self.y == c.y

    def t(self): #return a tuple representation.
        return (self.x,self.y)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Usage</strong></p>

<pre><code>c1 = coord(4,3) #init coords
c2 = coord(3,4)

c3 = c1 + c2    #summing two coordinates. calls the overload __add__
print c3.t()    #prints (7, 7)
c3 = c3 - c1
print c3.t()    #prints (3, 4)
print c3 == c2  #prints True
</code></pre>

<p>you could improve coord to extend other operators as well (less than, greater than ..).</p>

<p>In this version after doing your calculations you can call the pygame methods expecting tuples by just saying coord.t(). There might be a better way than have a function to return the tuple form though. </p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>To get your "+" and "+=" behaviour you can define your own class and implement the <code>__add__()</code> method. The following is an incomplete sample:</p>

<pre><code># T.py
class T(object):
    def __init__(self, *args):
        self._t = args
    def __add__(self, other):
        return T(*([sum(x) for x in zip(self._t, other._t)]))
    def __str__(self):
        return str(self._t)
    def __repr__(self):
        return repr(self._t)

&gt;&gt;&gt; from T import T
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = T(50, 50)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = T(3, -5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
(50, 50)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b
(3, -5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a+b
(53, 45)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a+=b
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
(53, 45)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = T(50, 50, 50)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = T(10, -10, 10)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a+b
(60, 40, 60)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a+b+b
(70, 30, 70)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT: I've found a better way...</strong></p>

<p>Define class T as a subclass of tuple and override the <code>__new__</code> and <code>__add__</code> methods. This provides the same interface as class <code>tuple</code> (but with different behaviour for <code>__add__</code>), so instances of class T can be passed to anything that expects a tuple.</p>

<pre><code>class T(tuple):
    def __new__(cls, *args):
        return tuple.__new__(cls, args)
    def __add__(self, other):
        return T(*([sum(x) for x in zip(self, other)]))
    def __sub__(self, other):
        return self.__add__(-i for i in other)

&gt;&gt;&gt; a = T(50, 50)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = T(3, -5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
(50, 50)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b
(3, -5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a+b
(53, 45)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a+=b
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
(53, 45)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = T(50, 50, 50)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = T(10, -10, 10)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a+b
(60, 40, 60)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a+b+b
(70, 30, 70)
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; c = a + b
&gt;&gt;&gt; c[0]
60
&gt;&gt;&gt; c[-1]
60
&gt;&gt;&gt; for x in c:
...     print x
... 
60
40
60

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>My two cents, hope this helps</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; coord = (50, 50)
&gt;&gt;&gt; change = (3, -5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; tuple(sum(item) for item in zip(coord, change))
(53, 45)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I wanted to point out that you can define your own class, but others obviously gave that answer too. Anyway, if you're interested, I put very long answer about matrices that defines <code>Vector</code> class (and much more) <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1016284/matrix-transforms-concepts-and-theory-are-there-any-free-resources-for-learning/1022743#1022743">here</a>.</p>
