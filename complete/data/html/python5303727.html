<h3>Question (ID-5303727):</h3><h2>randomizing a list in python manually</h2><p>Here's some code for shuffling a deck of cards manually.  I understand it up to the point where <code>cards[pos], cards[randpos] = cards[randpos], cards[pos]</code>.  What is happening here?  What is the point of assigning cards[pos] to cards[randpos]?</p>

<p>self.cards is a list of playing cards in standard order.</p>

<pre><code>  def shuffle(self):
        n = len(self.cards)
        cards = self.cards
        for pos in range(n):
            randpos = randrange(pos,n)
            cards[pos], cards[randpos] = cards[randpos], cards[pos]
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The values of <code>cards[pos]</code> and <code>cards[randpos]</code> are being switched. This is a common Python idiom: you can switch two or more variables' values by saying <code>a, b = b, a</code>.</p>

<p>Note that <a href="http://svn.python.org/view/python/branches/release27-maint/Lib/random.py?view=markup#l276" rel="nofollow">the standard library implementation of shuffling (<code>random.shuffle()</code>) is quite similar</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><code>cards[pos], cards[randpos] = cards[randpos], cards[pos]</code></p>

<p>Is swapping the card at index pos with the card at index randpos</p>

<p>It's basically assigning card[randpos] to card[pos] and card[pos] to card[randpos].  Another way to do it would be</p>

<pre><code>t = card[pos]
card[pos] = card[randpos]
card[randpos] = t
</code></pre>

<p>The former is just shorter and more pythonic.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>It's swapping the positions of the cards in <code>pos</code> and <code>randpos</code>.</p>

<p>So, for example, if your list were <code>[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]</code> and pos were <code>0</code>, first it would pick an index that comes after the <code>1</code> in the list. Then it would swap the <code>1</code> and the number at that index. So if <code>randpos</code> is 3 on the first iteration, we end up with <code>[4,2,3,1,5,6,7]</code> after one time through the loop.</p>

<p>As a side note, it is much more efficient (and reliable) to use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/random.html#random.shuffle" rel="nofollow">random.shuffle()</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>In python</p>

<pre><code>a, b = b, a
</code></pre>

<p>is how you swap two variables. In your code what are swapped are the contents of the list at position <code>pos</code> and <code>randpos</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><pre><code>cards[pos], cards[randpos] = cards[randpos], cards[pos]
</code></pre>

<p>This is simply swapping <code>cards[pos]</code> and <code>cards[randpos]</code></p>

<p>Here's an entire Web page on the technique:  <a href="http://blog.mithis.net/archives/ideas/64-python-swap-var" rel="nofollow">http://blog.mithis.net/archives/ideas/64-python-swap-var</a></p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>It's basically randomly swapping cards. It's taking <code>cards[pos]</code> out of the deck, placing <code>cards[randpos]</code> at its location, and placing <code>cards[pos]</code> back at where <code>cards[randpos]</code> was.</p>

<p>Also note, that Python provides <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/random.html#random.shuffle" rel="nofollow"><code>random.shuffle</code></a> so that you don't have to do this manually.</p>
