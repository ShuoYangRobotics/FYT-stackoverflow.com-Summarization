<h3>Question (ID-75798):</h3><h2>Django -vs- Grails -vs-?</h2><p>I'm wondering if there's such a thing as Django-like ease of web app development combined with good deployment, debugging and other tools? </p>

<p>Django is a very productive framework for building content-heavy sites; the best I've tried and a breath of fresh air compared to some of the Java monstrosities out there. However it's written in Python which means there's little real support in the way of deployment/packaging, debugging, profilers and other tools that make building and maintaining applications much easier. </p>

<p>Ruby has similar issues and although I do like Ruby <strong>much</strong> better than I like Python, I get the impression that Rails is roughly in the same boat at Django when it comes to managing/supporting the app. </p>

<p>Has anyone here tried both Django and Grails (or other web frameworks) for non-trivial projects? How did they compare?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-9):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You asked for someone who used both Grails and Django. I've done work on both for big projects. Here's my Thoughts:</p>

<p><strong>IDE's:</strong>
Django works really well in Eclipse, Grails works really well in IntelliJ Idea.</p>

<p><strong>Debugging:</strong>
Practically the same (assuming you use IntelliJ for Grails, and Eclipse for Python). Step debugging, inspecting variables, etc... never need a print statement for either. Sometimes django error messages can be useless but Grails error messages are usually pretty lengthy and hard to parse through.</p>

<p><strong>Time to run a unit test:</strong>
django: 2 seconds.
Grails: 20 seconds (the tests themselves both run in a fraction of a second, it's the part about loading the framework to run them that takes the rest... as you can see, Grails is frustratingly slow to load).</p>

<p><strong>Deployment:</strong>
Django: copy &amp; paste one file into an apache config, and to redeploy, just change the code and reload apache.
Grails: create a .war file, deploy it on tomcat, rinse and repeat to redeploy.</p>

<p><strong>Programming languages:</strong>
Groovy is TOTALLY awesome. I love it, more so than Python. But I certainly have no complaints. </p>

<p><strong>Plugins:</strong>
Grails: lots of broken plugins (and can use every java lib ever).
Django: a few stable plugins, but enough to do most of what you need.</p>

<p><strong>Database:</strong>
Django: schema migrations using South, and generally intuitive relations.
Grails: no schema migrations, and by default it deletes the database on startup... WTF</p>

<p><strong>Usage:</strong>
Django: startups (especially in the Gov 2.0 space), independent web dev shops.
Grails: enterprise</p>

<p>Hope that helps!</p>

<p>Python has:</p>

<ol>
<li>a <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-pdb.html" rel="nofollow">great interactive debugger</a>, which makes very good use of Python <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REPL" rel="nofollow">REPL</a>. </li>
<li><a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall" rel="nofollow">easy_install</a> anv <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv" rel="nofollow">virtualenv</a> for dependency management, packaging and deployment.</li>
<li><a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/profile.html" rel="nofollow">profiling features</a> comparable to other languages</li>
</ol>

<p>So IMHO you shouldn't worry about this things, use Python and Django and live happily :-)</p>

<p>Lucky for you, newest version of <a href="http://blog.leosoto.com/2008/08/django-on-jython-its-here.html" rel="nofollow">Django runs on Jython</a>, so you don't need to leave your whole Java ecosystem behind.</p>

<p>Speaking of frameworks, I evaluated this year:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://pylonshq.com/" rel="nofollow">Pylons</a> (Python)</li>
<li><a href="http://webpy.org/" rel="nofollow">webpy</a> (Python)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.symfony-project.org/" rel="nofollow">Symfony</a> (PHP)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cakephp.org/" rel="nofollow">CakePHP</a> (PHP)</li>
</ol>

<p>None of this frameworks comes close to the power of Django or Ruby on Rails. Based on my collegue opinion I could recommend you <a href="http://www.kohanaphp.com/home" rel="nofollow">kohana</a> framework. The downside is, it's written in PHP and, as far as I know, PHP doesn't have superb tools for debugging, profiling and packaging of apps.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Here is a very good <a href="http://bud.ca/blog/pony" rel="nofollow">article about packaging and deployment of Python apps</a> (specifically Django apps). It's a hot topic in Django community now.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Grails.</p>

<p>Grails is just looks like Rails (Ruby) but it using groovy which is simple than java. It use java technology and you can use any java lib without any trouble.</p>

<p>I also choose grails over simplicity and there are lots of java lib (such as jasper report, jawr etc) and I am glad that now they join with SpringSource which make their base solid.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The "good deployment" issue -- for Python -- doesn't have the Deep Significance that it has for Java.</p>

<p>Python deployment for Django is basically "move the files".  You can run straight out of the subversion trunk directory if you want to.</p>

<p>You can, without breaking much of a sweat, using the Python <a href="http://docs.python.org/dist/dist.html" rel="nofollow">distutils</a> and build yourself a distribution kit that puts your Django apps into Python's site-packages.  I'm not a big fan of it, but it's really easy to do.  </p>

<p>Since my stuff runs in Linux, I have simple "install.py" scripts that move stuff out of the Subversion directories into <code>/opt/this</code> and <code>/opt/that</code> directories.  I use an explicit path settings in my Apache configuration to name those directories where the applications live.</p>

<p>Patching can be done by editing the files in place.  (A bad policy.)  I prefer to edit in the SVN location and rerun my little install to be sure I actually have all the files under control.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>The statement that grails deletes the database on startup is completely wrong.  It's behavior on startup is completely configurable and easy to configure.  I generally use create-drop when running an app in dev mode.  I use update when I run in test and production.</p>

<p>I also love the bootstrap processing that lets me pre-configure test users, data, etc by environment in Grails.  </p>

<p>I'd love to see someone who has really built and deployed some commercial projects comment on the pros / cons.  Be a really interesting read.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>cakephp.org</p>

<p>Cakephp is really good, really close to ruby on rails (1.2).  It is in php, works very well on shared hosts and is easy to implement. </p>

<p>The only downside is that the documentation is somewhat lacking, but you quickly get it and quickly start doing cool stuff.</p>

<p>I totally recommend cakephp.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I have two friends who originally started writing an application using Ruby on Rails, but ran into a number of issues and limitations.  After about 8 weeks of working on it, they decided to investigate other alternatives.</p>

<p>They settled on the <a href="http://www.catalystframework.org" rel="nofollow">Catalyst Framework</a>, and Perl.  That was about 4 months ago now, and they've repeatedly talked about how much better the application is going, and how much more flexibility they have.</p>

<p>With Perl, you have all of CPAN available to you, along with the large quantity of tools included.  I'd suggest taking a look at it, at least.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Personally I made some rather big projects with Django, but I can compare only with said "montrosities" (Spring, EJB) and really low-level stuff like Twisted.</p>

<p>Web frameworks using interpreted languages are mostly in its infancy and all of them (actively maintained, that is) are getting better with every day.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>By "good deployment" are you comparing it with Java's EAR files, which allow you to deploy web applications by uploading a single file to a J2EE server? (And, to a lesser extent, WAR files; EAR files can have WAR files for dependent projects)</p>

<p>I don't think Django or Rails have gotten quite to that point yet, but I could be wrong...  zuber pointed out an article with more details on the Python side.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.capify.org/" rel="nofollow">Capistrano</a> may help out on the Ruby side.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I haven't really worked with either Python or Ruby that much, so I can't help out on profilers or debuggers.</p>
