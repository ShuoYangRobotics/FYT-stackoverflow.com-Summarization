<h3>Question (ID-4373428):</h3><h2>How do I find where Python is located on Unix?</h2><p>I'm working on a new server for a new workplace, and I'm trying to reuse a CGI script I wrote in Python earlier this year. My CGI script starts off with</p>

<pre><code>#!/local/usr/bin/python
</code></pre>

<p>But when I run this on the new server, it complains that there's no such folder. Obviously Python's kept in a different place on this box, but I've got no idea where. </p>

<p>I haven't done much unix before, just enough to get around, so if there's some neat trick I should know here I'd appreciate it :)</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><em>Update</em>:</p>

<p>I misread. Replace your header with</p>

<p><code>#!/usr/bin/env python</code></p>

<p>This will pull in the python location from the user that runs the script's environmental settings</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>For this very reason it is recommend that you change your shebang line to be more path agnostic:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
</code></pre>

<p>See <a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/tutor/2007-June/054816.html" rel="nofollow">this mailing list message</a> for more information:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Consider the possiblities that in a different machine, python may be installed at <code>/usr/bin/python</code> or <code>/bin/python</code> in those cases, <code>#!/usr/local/bin/python</code> will fail.
  For those cases, we get to call the <code>env</code> executable with argument which will determine the arguments path by searching in the <code>$PATH</code> and use it correctly.</p>
  
  <p>(<code>env</code> is almost always located in <code>/usr/bin/</code> so one need not worry that <code>env</code> is not present at <code>/usr/bin</code>.)</p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Try:</p>

<pre><code>which python
</code></pre>

<p>in a terminal.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The proper way to solve this problem is with</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
</code></pre>

<p>which allows for the use of a binary in the PATH in a shebang.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Try: <code>which python</code> or <code>whereis python</code></p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>good idea to use backtick for header python script</p>

<pre><code>`which python`
</code></pre>
