<p>Some notes, thanks to commenters:</p>

<ol>
<li>The with statement automatically closes the file again when the block ends.</li>
<li>The with statement only works in python 2.5 and up, and in python 2.5 you need to use <code>from __future__ import with_statement</code></li>
<li>In Python 3 you should specify the file encoding for the file you open. <a href="http://docs.python.org/3.1/library/functions.html?highlight=open#open">Read more</a>...</li>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><pre><code>infile = open('filename.txt', 'r')
firstLine = infile.readline()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Lots of other answers here, but to answer <em>precisely</em> the question you asked:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; f = open('myfile.txt')
&gt;&gt;&gt; data = f.read()
&gt;&gt;&gt; # I'm assuming you had the above before asking the question
&gt;&gt;&gt; first_line = data.split('\n', 1)[0]
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, if you've already read in the file (as you said), and have a big block of data in memory, then to get the first line from it efficiently, do a split() on the newline character, once only, and take the first element from the resulting list.</p>

<p>Note that this does not include the <code>\n</code> character at the end of the line, but I'm assuming you don't want it anyway (and a single-line file may not even have one).  Also note that although it's pretty short and quick, it does make a copy of the data, so for a really large blob of memory you may not consider it "efficient".  As always, it depends...</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>This should do it:</p>

<pre><code>f = open('myfile.txt')
first = f.readline()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I'm going to go ahead and spice this up a little bit:</p>

<pre><code>with open('myfile.txt','r') as f:
    line = f.readline()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><pre><code>fline=open("myfile").readline().rstrip()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>To go back to the beginning of an open file, do this:</p>

<pre><code>my_file.seek(0)
</code></pre>
