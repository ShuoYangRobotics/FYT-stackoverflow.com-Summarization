<h3>Question (ID-3174392):</h3><h2>Is it Pythonic to use bools as ints?</h2><p><code>False</code> is equivalent to <code>0</code> and <code>True</code> is equivalent <code>1</code> so it's possible to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>def bool_to_str(value):
    """value should be a bool"""
    return ['No', 'Yes'][value]

bool_to_str(True)
</code></pre>

<p>Notice how value is <code>bool</code> but is used as an <code>int</code>.</p>

<p>Is this this kind of use Pythonic or should it be avoided?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I'll be the odd voice out (since all answers are decrying the use of the fact that <code>False == 0</code> and <code>True == 1</code>, as the language guarantees) as I claim that the use of this fact to simplify your code is perfectly fine.</p>

<p>Historically, logical true/false operations tended to simply use <code>0</code> for false and <code>1</code> for true; in the course of Python 2.2's life-cycle, Guido noticed that too many modules started with assignments such as <code>false = 0; true = 1</code> and this produced boilerplate and useless variation (the latter because the capitalization of true and false was all over the place -- some used all-caps, some all-lowercase, some cap-initial) and so introduced the <code>bool</code> subclass of <code>int</code> and its <code>True</code> and <code>False</code> constants.</p>

<p>There was quite some pushback at the time since many of us feared that the new type and constants would be used by Python newbies to <em>restrict</em> the language's abilities, but Guido was adamant that we were just being pessimistic: nobody would ever understand Python so badly, for example, as to avoid the perfectly natural use of <code>False</code> and <code>True</code> as list indices, or in a summation, or other such perfectly clear and useful idioms.</p>

<p>The answers to this thread prove we were right: as we feared, a total misunderstanding of the roles of this type and constants <em>has</em> emerged, and people <em>are</em> avoiding, and, worse!, urging others to avoid, perfectly natural Python constructs in favor of useless gyrations.</p>

<p>Fighting against the tide of such misunderstanding, I urge everybody to <em>use Python as Python</em>, <strong>not</strong> trying to force it into the mold of other languages whose functionality and preferred style are quite different.  <strong>In Python</strong>, True and False are 99.9% like 1 and 0, differing <em>exclusively</em> in their <code>str(...)</code> (and thereby <code>repr(...)</code>) form -- for <em>every</em> other operation except stringification, just feel free to use them without contortions.  That goes for indexing, arithmetic, bit operations, etc, etc, etc.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>surely:</p>

<pre><code>def bool_to_str(value):
    """value should be a bool"""
    return 'Yes' if value else 'No'
</code></pre>

<p>is more readable.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I'm with Alex. <code>False==0</code> and <code>True==1</code>, and there's nothing wrong with that.</p>

<p>Still, in Python 2.5 and later I'd write the answer to this particular question using Python's conditional expression:</p>

<pre><code>def bool_to_str(value):
  return `Yes` if value else `No`
</code></pre>

<p>That way there's no requirement that the argument is actually a bool -- just as <code>if x: ...</code> accepts any type for <code>x</code>, the <code>bool_to_str()</code> function should do the right thing when it is passed None, a string, a list, or 3.14.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Your code seems inaccurate in some cases:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def bool_to_str(value):
...     """value should be a bool"""
...     return ['No', 'Yes'][value]
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; bool_to_str(-2)
'No'
</code></pre>

<p>And I recommend you to use just the conditional operator for readability:</p>

<pre><code>def bool_to_str(value):
    """value should be a bool"""
    return "Yes" if value else "No"
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>It is actually a feature of the language that False == 0 and True == 1 (it does not depend on the implementation): <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2764017/is-false-0-and-true-1-in-python-an-implementation-detail-or-guaranteed-by-t">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2764017/is-false-0-and-true-1-in-python-an-implementation-detail-or-guaranteed-by-t</a></p>

<p>However, I do agree with most of the other answers: there are very readable ways of obtaining the same result as <code>['No', 'Yes'][value]</code>, through the use of the <code>… if value else …</code> or of a dictionary, which have the respective advantages of hinting and stating that <code>value</code> is a boolean.</p>

<p>Plus, the <code>… if value else …</code> follows the usual convention that non-0 is True: it also works even when value is True but with <code>value == -2</code>, as hinted by dahlia.  The list and dict approaches are not as robust, in this case.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>At the <strong>very</strong> least, use a dict for forward compatibility.</p>

<pre><code>return {False: 'No', True: 'Yes'}[value]
</code></pre>

<p>But don't do it this way. Use a full if statement instead.</p>

<pre><code>if value:
  return 'Yes'
return 'No'
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Using a bool as an int is quite OK because bool is s subclass of int.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance(True, int)
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance(False, int)
True
</code></pre>

<p>About your code: Putting it in a one-line function like that is over the top. Readers need to find your function source or docs and read it (the name of the function doesn't tell you much). This interrupts the flow. Just put it inline and don't use a list (built at run time), use a tuple (built at compile time if the values are constants). Example:</p>

<pre><code>print foo, bar, num_things, ("OK", "Too many!)[num_things &gt; max_things]
</code></pre>
