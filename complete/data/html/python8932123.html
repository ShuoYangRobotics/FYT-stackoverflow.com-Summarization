<h3>Question (ID-8932123):</h3><h2>Writing a generalized function for both strings and lists in python</h2><p>So i'm green as grass and learning programming from <a href="http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/lists.html" rel="nofollow">How to think like a computer scientist: Learn python 3</a>. I'm able to answer the question (see below) but fear i'm missing the lesson. </p>

<p>Write a function (called insert_at_end) that will pass (return the bold given the two arguments before) for all three:</p>

<pre><code>test(insert_at_end(5, [1, 3, 4, 6]), **[1, 3, 4, 6, 5]**)
test(insert_at_end('x', 'abc'),  **'abcx'**)
test(insert_at_end(5, (1, 3, 4, 6)), **(1, 3, 4, 6, 5)**)
</code></pre>

<p>The book gives this hint:"These exercises illustrate nicely that the sequence abstraction is general, (<strong>because slicing, indexing, and concatenation</strong> are so general), so it is possible to write general functions that work over all sequence types.".</p>

<p>This version doesn't have solutions on-line (that i could find) but in I found someone's answers to a previous version of the text (for python 2.7) and they did it this way:</p>

<pre><code>def encapsulate(val, seq):
    if type(seq) == type(""):
        return str(val)
    if type(seq) == type([]):
        return [val]
    return (val,)

def insert_at_end(val, seq): 
    return seq + encapsulate(val, seq)
</code></pre>

<p>Which seems to be solving the question by distinguishing between lists and strings... going against the hint.  So how about it Is there a way to answer the question (and about 10 more similar ones) without distinguishing? i.e not using "type()" </p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-9):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I'd say that the example isn't symetric, meaning that it asks the reader handle two different cases:</p>

<ul>
<li>int, list</li>
<li>str, str</li>
</ul>

<p>In my opinion, the exercise should ask to implement this:</p>

<ul>
<li>list, list: insert_at_end([5], [1, 3, 4, 6])</li>
<li>str, str: insert_at_end('x', 'abc')</li>
</ul>

<p>In this case, the reader has to work only with two parameters that use the same sequence type and the hint would make much more sense.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>My best effort:</p>

<pre><code>def insert_at_end(val, seq):
    t = type(seq)
    try:
        return seq + t(val)
    except TypeError:
        return seq + t([val])
</code></pre>

<p>This will attempt to create the sequence of <code>type(seq)</code> and if <code>val</code> is not iterable produces a list and concatenates.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>That problem is one of a long list and the hint applies to all of them. I think it is reasonable that, having written the <code>encapsulate</code> function which can be re-used for things like <code>insert_at_front</code>, the rest of the implementation is type agnostic.</p>

<p>However, I think a better implementation of <code>encapsulate</code> might be:</p>

<pre><code>def encapsulate(val, seq):
    if isinstance(seq, basestring):
        return val
    return type(seq)([val])
</code></pre>

<p>which handles a wider range of types with less code.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>This is <em>not</em> a solution but rather an explanation why a truly elegant solution does not look possible.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>+</code> concatenates sequences, but only sequences of same type.</li>
<li>values passed as first argument to <code>insert_at_end</code> are 'scalar', so you have to convert them to the sequence type that the second argument has.</li>
<li>to do that, you cannot simply call a sequence constructor with a scalar argument and create a one-item sequence of that type: <code>tuple(1)</code> does not work.</li>
<li><code>str</code> works differently than other sequence types: <code>tuple(["a"])</code> is <code>("a",)</code>, <code>list(["a"])</code> is <code>["a"]</code>, but <code>str(["a"]))</code> is <code>"['a']"</code> and not <code>"a"</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>This renders <code>+</code> useless in this situation, even though you can easily construct a sequence of  given type cleanly, without <code>instanceof</code>, just by using <code>type()</code>.</p>

<p>You can't use slice assignment, too, since only lists are mutable.</p>

<p>In this situation, the solution by @Hamish looks cleanest.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>The challenge with this question (in Python 2.7, I'm testing 3.2 right now to verify) is that two of the possible input types for <code>seq</code> are immutable, and you're expected to return the same type as was passed in.  For strings, this is less of an issue, because you could do this:</p>

<pre><code>return seq + char
</code></pre>

<p>As that will return a new string that's the concatenation of the input sequence and the appended character, but that doesn't work for lists or tuples.  You can only concatenate a list to a list or a tuple to a tuple.  If you wanted to avoid "type" checking, you could get there with something like this:</p>

<pre><code>if hasattr(seq, 'append'): # List input.
  seq.append(char)
elif hasattr(seq, 'strip'): # String input.
  seq = seq + char
else: # Tuple
  seq = seq + (char,)

return seq
</code></pre>

<p>That's really not much different from actually checking types, but it does avoid using the <code>type</code> function directly.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>This solution still requires some separate code for strings as opposed to lists/tuples, but it is more concise and doesn't do any checking for specific types.</p>

<pre><code>def insert_at_end(val, seq):
    try:
        return seq + val
    except TypeError:   # unsupported operand type(s) for +
        return seq + type(seq)([val])
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Maybe this is nearer the answer:</p>

<pre><code>def genappend(x, s):
    if isinstance(s, basestring):
        t = s[0:0].join
    else:
        t = type(s)
    lst = list(s)
    lst.append(x)
    return t(lst)

print genappend(5, [1,2,3,4])    
print genappend(5, (1,2,3,4))
print genappend('5', '1234')
</code></pre>

<p>There could also be completely user-defined sequence types. They will also work as long as convertable to and from a list. This also works:</p>

<pre><code>print genappend('5', set('1234'))
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>I agree that the point is if <code>item</code> is iterable or not.</p>

<p>So my solution would be this:</p>

<pre><code>def iterate(seq, item):
    for i in seq:
        yield i
    yield item

def insert_at_end(seq, item):
    if hasattr(item, '__iter__'):
        return seq + item
    else:
        return type(seq)(iterate(seq, item))
</code></pre>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; insert_at_end('abc', 'x')
'abcx'
&gt;&gt;&gt; insert_at_end([1, 2, 4, 6], 5)
[1, 2, 4, 6, 5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; insert_at_end((1, 2, 4, 6), 5)
(1, 2, 4, 6, 5)
</code></pre>

<p>Since <code>insert_at_end</code> can handle iterable and not, works fine even with:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; insert_at_end('abc', 'xyz')
'abcxyz'
&gt;&gt;&gt; insert_at_end([1, 2, 4, 6], [5, 7])
[1, 2, 4, 6, 5, 7]
&gt;&gt;&gt; insert_at_end((1, 2, 4, 6), (5, 7))
(1, 2, 4, 6, 5, 7)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>While encapsulate relies on the type, the code directly in insert_at_end does not, and relies on + meaning related things for all 3 types, and so in that sense, fits in with the hint.</p>
