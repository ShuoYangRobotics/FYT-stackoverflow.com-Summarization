<h3>Question (ID-1455602):</h3><h2>Printing tuple with string formatting in Python</h2><p>So, i have this problem.
I got tuple (1,2,3) which i should print with string formatting.
eg.
tup = (1,2,3)
print "this is a tuple %something" % (tup)</p>

<p>and this should print tuple representation with brackets, like
This is a tuple (1,2,3)</p>

<p>How in the world am I able to do this? Kinda lost here so if you guys could point me to a right direction :)</p>

&gt;&gt;&gt; print "this is a tuple: %s" % (thetuple,)
this is a tuple: (1, 2, 3)
</code></pre>

<p>Making a singleton tuple with the tuple of interest as the only item, i.e. the <code>(thetuple,)</code> part, is the key bit here.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>This doesn't use string formatting, but you should be able to do:</p>

<pre><code>print 'this is a tuple ', (1, 2, 3)
</code></pre>

<p>If you really want to use string formatting:</p>

<pre><code>print 'this is a tuple %s' % str((1, 2, 3))
# or
print 'this is a tuple %s' % ((1, 2, 3),)
</code></pre>

<p>Note, this assumes you are using a Python version earlier than 3.0.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; tup = (1, 2, 3)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print "Here it is: %s" % (tup,)
Here it is: (1, 2, 3)
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that <code>(tup,)</code> is a tuple containing a tuple. The outer tuple is the argument to the % operator. The inner tuple is its content, which is actually printed.</p>

<p><code>(tup)</code> is an expression in brackets, which when evaluated results in <code>tup</code>.</p>

<p><code>(tup,)</code> with the trailing comma is a tuple, which contains <code>tup</code> as is only member.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Check out the pprint module.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><pre><code>t = (1, 2, 3)

# the comma (,) concatenates the strings and adds a space
print "this is a tuple", (t)

# format is the most flexible way to do string formatting
print "this is a tuple {0}".format(t)

# classic string formatting
# I use it only when working with older Python versions
print "this is a tuple %s" % repr(t)
print "this is a tuple %s" % str(t)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I think the best way to do this is:</p>

<pre><code>t = (1,2,3)

print "This is a tuple: %s" % str(t)
</code></pre>

<p>If you're familiar with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf#printf%5Fformat%5Fplaceholders" rel="nofollow">printf</a> style formatting, then Python supports its own version. In Python, this is done using the "%" operator applied to strings (an overload of the modulo operator), which takes any string and applies printf-style formatting to it.</p>

<p>In our case, we are telling it to print "This is a tuple: ", and then adding a string "%s", and for the actual string, we're passing in a string representation of the tuple (by calling str(t)).</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with printf style formatting, I highly suggest learning, since it's very standard. Most languages support it in one way or another.</p>
