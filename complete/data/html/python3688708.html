<h3>Question (ID-3688708):</h3><h2>Python, safe, sandbox</h2><p>I'd like to make a website where people could upload their Python scripts. Of course I'd like to execute those scripts. Those scripts should do some interesting work. The problem is that people could upload scripts that could harm  my server and I'd like to prevent that. What is the option to run arbitrary scripts without harming my system - actually without seeing my system at all? Thank you</p>

<p>Running arbitrary (untrusted) scripts and staying safe is a contradiction. You should go as far as using custom kernels, jails, vms, the like.</p>

<p>You can look at how <a href="http://codepad.org/about" rel="nofollow">http://codepad.org/about</a> does it, it's a <em>lot</em> of work.</p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>"Can't be done," is too harsh. JavaScript engines live in your web browser and they accept and run untrusted scripts safely. There's always the possibility of exploits, but in correct engine operation they are innocuous. There are even "slow script" checks that prevent infinite loops from denial-of-service attacking your browser, making those little alert dialogs.</p>

<p>Google App Engine runs a sandboxed version of the Python VM which effectively removes all the naughty native bits that let you get at the underlying system. To do this yourself in a safe manner would take some Python VM expertise.</p>

<p>For sanity, you could start off by removing <em>all</em> builtins and whitelisting the ones you want to allow users once you certify they don't touch the underlying system.</p>

<p>It feels like something somebody must have already done, but I don't know of any existing project that does it. :-/</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Brett Cannon has a tentative design for doing this, last I knew, but it has not been developed.  So unless you're looking to put a LOT of effort into making this happen, there currently isn't a solution publicly available.</p>

<p>Brett's blog is at: <a href="http://sayspy.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://sayspy.blogspot.com/</a> if you want to try to read up on it, I couldn't find a direct link to his discussions about the new security design.  I can't recall if I read his blog talking about it, or if it was in person where he mentioned it, sorry.</p>

<p>There used to be some restricted execution abilities, but they were dropped because they just didn't work.</p>

<p>It's not impossible to do, but it's not something that Python is able to do right now.  It's something people would like, but it's not really a high priority from what I've seen.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>there are quite a lot of web-server running untrusted python codes nowadays:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://codepad.org/" rel="nofollow">http://codepad.org/</a> (probably the most notorious pastebin for python codes)</li>
<li><a href="http://codingbat.com/" rel="nofollow">http://codingbat.com/</a> (previously Javabat, name change to reflect Python addition)</li>
<li><a href="http://appengine.google.com/" rel="nofollow">http://appengine.google.com/</a> (host python code on Google's infrastructure)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.spoj.pl/" rel="nofollow">http://www.spoj.pl/</a> the infamous Sphere Online Judge coding challenge</li>
</ul>

<p>you may want to look at how they approached their problems.</p>

<p>or you may want to look at a different approach:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://pyjs.org/" rel="nofollow">http://pyjs.org/</a> - pyjamas - python-to-javascript compiler (running client-side, switch the security problem to their side)</li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I think the way to do this is to run those scripts in normal Python shell, but on a virtual machine. I might be biased, because my "job" is currently to play around with VMs (universities are great!).</p>

<p>A new VM instance can be created and started in seconds. If you keep a few around and replace only those that get broken, you have good service, absolute security and almost no effort.</p>

<p>But there is one thing: Virtually all web hosts today are virtual machines and they don't support another virtual machine inside. You need a real, physical server to do this.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.trypython.org/" rel="nofollow">trypython.org</a> (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/trypython/" rel="nofollow">BSD licensed source here</a>) does a safe browser oriented version of such a sanbox in IronPython (via Silverlight/Moonlight).  You may be able to mash together a headless version of this for use on a server -- but you could definitely let users distribute scripts between each other, or you could distribute these scripts to be executed within the plugin environment.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>I dont know in earlier versions, in Python 3 you can create functions with access to a custom scope through types.FunctionType.</p>

<pre><code>def f():
  return __builtins__

f() # this will work because it has access to __builtins__
scope = {}
sandboxed = FunctionType(f.__code__,scope)
sandboxed()  # will throw NameError, builtins is not defined
</code></pre>

<p>the returned function has only access to whatever you supplied in the scope dictionary. I wonder if still there are hacks around this.</p>
