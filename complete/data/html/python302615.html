<p><a href="http://docs.python.org/library/simplehttpserver.html" rel="nofollow">SimpleHTTPServer</a> comes free as part of the standard Python libraries.</p>

<p>If you need more features, look into <a href="http://cherrypy.org/" rel="nofollow">CherryPy</a> or (at the top end) <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/" rel="nofollow">Twisted</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I'm becoming a big fan of the newly released <a href="http://trac.softcircuit.com.au/circuits" rel="nofollow" title="circuits">circuits</a> library. It's a component/event framework that comes with a very nice set of packages for creating web servers &amp; apps. Here's the simple web example from the site:</p>

<pre><code>from circuits.lib.web import Server, Controller

class HelloWorld(Controller):
   def index(self):
      return "Hello World!"

server = Server(8000)
server += HelloWorld()
server.run()
</code></pre>

<p>Its WSGI support is no more complicated than that, either. Good stuff.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If you're doing a lot of concurrent stuff, you might consider <a href="http://www.kamaelia.org/Home" rel="nofollow">Kamaelia</a>'s <a href="http://www.kamaelia.org/Components/pydoc/Kamaelia.Protocol.HTTP.HTTPServer.html" rel="nofollow">HTTPServer</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I've found web.py pretty easy to use : <a href="http://webpy.org/" rel="nofollow">http://webpy.org/</a></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>If you want to use something from the standard library I would strongly recommend <em>not</em> using SimpleHTTPServer, but instead using <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/wsgiref.html#module-wsgiref.simple_server" rel="nofollow"><code>wsgiref.simple_server</code></a>.  SimpleHTTPServer is awkward and a rather nonsensical way to implement a web application, and while raw WSGI isn't terribly easy (but certainly possible), you have the option to use any WSGI-based framework on top of it.  Also if you use wsgiref you will have the option to change to a server like CherryPy later (note that the server in CherryPy can be used separately from the rest of the framework, and you only need <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/wsgiref.html#module-wsgiref.simple_server" rel="nofollow">one file</a> for just the server).  For a "real" web application CherryPy has several advantages over wsgiref, but for a locally hosted application it's unlikely any of them will matter.</p>

<p>If you are making a desktop application you will need to launch a separate thread for either wsgiref or CherryPy.  If that's fine, then a WSGI-based server would probably be easiest.  If you don't want to launch a separate thread for the server then you most likely need to use Twisted.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>See the <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/lib/module-wsgiref.html" rel="nofollow">WSGI reference</a> implementation.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I made this one.  <a href="http://www.blendedtechnologies.com/python-trick-really-little-http-server/220" rel="nofollow">It just enhances Python's SimpleHTTPServer a bit to let you define custom actions depending on the request.</a></p>
