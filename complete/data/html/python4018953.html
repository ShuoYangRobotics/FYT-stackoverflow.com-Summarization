<h3>Question (ID-4018953):</h3><h2>What's the way to call a function dynamically in Python?</h2><p>I would like to do something like:</p>

<pre><code>dct = ['do_this', 'do_that']
dct[0]() // call do_this
</code></pre>

<p>But you can't call the string as a function (will get an error).</p>

<p>How can I achieve this without switching and without using a list of lambdas or functions?</p>

<p>Explicitly I want to refer the function by name.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Functions are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_object" rel="nofollow">first-class objects</a> in Python:</p>

<pre><code>def do_this():
    pass

def do_that():
    pass

dct = [do_this, do_that]
dct[0]()  # calls do_this()
</code></pre>

<p>If <code>dct</code> absolutely has to be a list of strings, I'd go with <code>eval()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>eval(dct[0] + "()")
</code></pre>

<p>It's not pretty, but switching between <code>globals()</code> and <code>getattr()</code> on the proper module can be a pain.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Funtions are first class objects. So like this:</p>

<pre><code>def do_this():
    print "In do_this"

def do_that():
    print "In do_that"

dct = [do_this, do_that]
dct[0]()
</code></pre>

<p>If you really want to call them from a string list you can use globals():</p>

<pre><code>dct = ['do_this', 'do_that']
globals()[dct[0]]()
</code></pre>

<p>But I would suggest that using globals() (or locals()) probably isn't the right way to solve your problem. Grok the python way: <code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import this</code></p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You can use <code>getattr</code> if they are in a module or <code>globals()</code> if they are in the global namespace:</p>

<pre><code>dct = ['do_this', 'do_that']

getattr(my_module, dct[0])()

globals()[dct[0]]()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>having the functions in some dict or in a class or instance</p>

<pre><code>
def fn_a():
    pass

some_dict = {
    'fn_a': fn_a,
}

class Someclass(object):

  @classmethod
  def fn_a(cls):
    pass

  # normal instance method
  def fn_b(self):
    pass

some_instance = Someclass()</code></pre>

<p>you could do: <code>some_dict['name']()</code> or <code>getattr(some_instance, 'fn_b')()</code> or <code>getattr(Someclass, 'fn_a')()</code></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>If the functions you want to call are part of a module:</p>

<pre><code>import module
getattr(module, funcname_string)(*args, **kwargs)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>As others have said, functions in Python are first-class objects. If you really want to get their names from a list, you can either use <code>eval()</code> (not popular) or use the <code>globals()</code> dictionary. Keep in mind that if these strings come from users, they're pretty dangerous. And if they don't come from users, then don't use strings.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><pre><code>def do_this(): pass
def do_that(): pass

dct = dict((x.__name__, x) for x in [do_this, do_that])
# dct maps function names to the function objects
# the names *don't* have to match the function name in your source:
#   dct = {"foo": do_this}
# which means user-facing names can be anything you want

dct["do_this"]()  # call do_this
</code></pre>
