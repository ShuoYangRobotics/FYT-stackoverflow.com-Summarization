<h3>Question (ID-940822):</h3><h2>Regular expression syntax for "match nothing"?</h2><p>I have a python template engine that heavily uses regexp. It's uses concatenation like </p>

<pre><code>re.compile( regexp1 + "|" + regexp2 + "*|" + regexp3 + "+" )
</code></pre>

<p>I can modify individual substrings (regexp1, regexp2 etc). Is it any small and light expression that match nothing so i can use it inside a template where i don't want any matches? Unfortunately, it's sometimes '+' or '*' after regexp atom so i can't use empty string - "nothing to repeat" error will rise.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>This shouldn't match anything:</p>

<pre><code>re.compile('$^')
</code></pre>

<p>So if you replace regexp1, regexp2 and regexp3 with '$^' it will be impossible to find a match. Unless you are using the multi line mode.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>After some tests I found a better solution</p>

<pre><code>re.compile('a^')
</code></pre>

<p>It is impossible to match and will fail earlier than the previous solution. You can replace a with any other character and it will always be impossible to match</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>To match an empty string - even in multiline mode - you can use <code>\A\Z</code>, so:</p>

<pre><code>re.compile('\A\Z|\A\Z*|\A\Z+')
</code></pre>

<p>The difference is that <code>\A</code> and <code>\Z</code> are start and end of <em>string</em>, whilst <code>^</code> and <code>$</code> these can match start/end of <em>lines</em>, so <code>$^|$^*|$^+</code> could potentially match a string containing newlines (if the flag is enabled).</p>

<p>And to fail to match anything (even an empty string), simply attempt to find content before the start of the string, e.g:</p>

<pre><code>re.compile('.\A|.\A*|.\A+')
</code></pre>

<p>Since no characters can come before \A (by definition), this will always fail to match.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><code>(?!)</code> should always fail to match.  It is the zero-width negative look-ahead.  If what is in the parentheses matches then the whole match fails.  Given that it has nothing in it, it will fail the match for anything (including nothing).</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><pre><code>"()"
</code></pre>

<p>matches nothing and nothing only.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Maybe <code>'.{0}'</code>?</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You could use<br />
<code>\z..</code><br />
This is the absolute end of string, followed by two of anything</p>

<p>If <code>+</code> or <code>*</code> is tacked on the end this still works refusing to match anything  </p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Or, use some list comprehension to remove the useless regexp entries and join to put them all together. Something like:</p>

<pre><code>re.compile('|'.join([x for x in [regexp1, regexp2, ...] if x != None]))
</code></pre>

<p>Be sure to add some comments next to that line of code though :-)</p>
