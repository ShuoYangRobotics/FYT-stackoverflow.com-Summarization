<h3>Question (ID-8365714):</h3><h2>Continue to elif after a nested if-statement?</h2><p>If the nested if-statement doesn't fulfill a condition, how do I continue on to the outer if? Eg. I have this (very impractical) example:</p>

<pre><code>a = 2

if( a &gt; 1 ):
    if( a == 3 ):
        print "yes"
elif( a == 2 ):
    print "yes"
</code></pre>

<p>I want a == 2 to be checked next. How would I do this?</p>

<p>(I have multiple conditions in that nested if that I need to check so I'd rather not have a huge string of and/or statements in that one outer-if. I also have more than one elif statement so I don't want to mash all the elifs together under that nested one.)</p>

<p>A deeper example:</p>

<pre><code>b = 8

if( a &gt; 1 ):
    if( b == 3 ):
        doSomething()
    elif( b == 4 ):
        doSomethingElse()
    elif( b == 5 ):
        more()
elif( -1 &lt;= a &lt;= 1 ):
    asd()
elif( a &lt; -1 ):
    if( b == 7 ):
        asdfasdf()
    elif( b == 8 ):
        asasdf()
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>combine the conditions and flatten the nesting:</p>

<pre><code>a = 2

if ( a &gt; 1 and a == 3 ):
    print "yes"
elif ( a == 2 ):
    print "yes"
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Considering the example is just indicative but your original question was to understand nested if-else, association, scoping ....</p>

<p>In Python, unlike Algol-like languages we don't have demarcated blocks (for ex. in C we use '{' to make a block. Here all blocks are via proper white-space indentation. Its like the philosophy, what you read is what you would get. This off-course is to adhere to the design philosophy "Code Readability".  </p>

<p>In similar context, whether the subsequent <code>if/else</code> statement would be part of the outer or inner if statement depends on how it was indented.</p>

<p>Your example</p>

<pre><code>a = 2

if( a &gt; 1 ):
    if( a == 3 ):
        print "yes"
elif( a == 2 ):
    print "yes"
</code></pre>

<p>Here <code>elif</code> is part of the outer <code>if</code>, because that's what it reads or rather looks and that's how it was indented. Instead the below modified version of your code</p>

<pre><code>a = 2

if( a &gt; 1 ):
    if( a == 3 ):
        print "yes"
    elif( a == 2 ):
        print "yes"
</code></pre>

<p>Would make the logic apparently different. More because the indented <code>elif</code> block is now aligned with the inner if.</p>

<p>This is now much easier compared to the following C Code</p>

<pre><code>if (a &gt; 1) 
   if (a == 3)
      printf("Hello World\n");
else if (a == 2)
   printf("Yes");
</code></pre>

<p>Can you easily say with which if the <code>else if</code> is associated?</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><pre><code>a = 2
if a &gt; 1:
    if a == 3:
        print "a is 3"
    elif a == 2:
        print "a is 2"
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>What outcomes do you want:  </p>

<ul>
<li>print "yes" when a is 2 or 3</li>
<li>otherwise do nothing</li>
</ul>

<p>Translate that into <em>simple</em> code  </p>

<pre><code>if a in (2, 3):
    print "yes"
</code></pre>

<p>"deeper" example: You don't need some of your nesting. The following <em>simple</em> code is equivalent to yours:</p>

<pre><code>if a == 1:
    if b == 7:
        print "yes 1, 7"
    elif b == 8:
        print "yes 1, 8"
elif a == 2:
    print "yes 2"
elif a == 3:
    print "yes 3"
elif a == 4:
    print "yes 4"
elif a == 5:
    print "yes 5"
</code></pre>

<p>By the way, please read <a href="http://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow">PEP 8</a> and have a look at some of the code written by others... <code>if( foo == 9 ):</code> is an unfamiliar pattern which causes readers to slow down over the speed humps, and possibly avoid that road in future.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Another way of writing this to make it easier to read and possibly easier to write would be to put the choices for one of the checks into a dictionary.  This will only work if you actually are checking equality, but may work for you.</p>

<pre><code>#used when a&gt;1
bchoices1 = {}
bchoices1[3] = doSomething
bchoices1[4] = doSomethingElse
bchoices1[5] = more

#used when a==1
bchoices2 = {}
bchoices2[7] = asdfasdf
bchoices2[8] = asdfas

if( a &gt; 1 ):
    bchoices1[b]()
elif( a == 2 ):
    asd()
elif( a == 1 ):
    bchoices2[b]()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>How do you expect this to be clear to a computer?</p>

<pre><code>if a &gt; 1:
  # ANYTHING
elif a == 2:
  # ANYTHING
</code></pre>

<p>by definition will never execute anything in the second block.</p>

<p>I believe your intend might be more along this lines:</p>

<pre><code>def action():
  if a &gt; 1:
    if b == 2:
      doSomething()
      return
    if b == 3:
      doSomethingElse()
      return
 if a == 2: # Note: NO elif!
   doDefaultForA2()
   return
 showError("Unknown command")
 return
</code></pre>

<p>There are multiple ways to achieve this behaviour. I like the <code>function+return</code> pattern, because it structures code nicely. Another way is to use a <code>handled</code> flag:</p>

<pre><code>unhandled = True
if a &gt; 1:
  if b == 2:
    doSomething()
    unhandled = False
  if unhandled and b == 3:
    doSomethingElse()
    unhandled = False
if unhandled and a == 2: # Note: NO elif!
  doDefaultForA2()
  unhandled = False
if unhandled:
  showError("Unknown command")
</code></pre>

<p>(You can obviously put in a number of shortcuts here by using elif. But using explicit "if unhandled" makes the code more verbose about the logic <em>and</em> easier to add new options.)</p>
