<h3>Question (ID-1974893):</h3><h2>Do you know any mainstream desktop applications developed with Python and Qt?</h2><p>Hi
i'm developing a small prototype of a desktop application using Qt and Python because i would like to distribute it in a multiplatform way.
A friend of mine is annoying me on messenger because he claims that there are not known cool mainstream desktop apps developed with Qt and python technologies so, what i am doing, is just an exercise without future.
Do you know any cool apps developed in python+Qt?
thanks</p>

<p>for an example of a powerful app, the <a href="http://eric-ide.python-projects.org/index.html" rel="nofollow">eric IDE</a> uses Python-Qt</p>

<p>as for plain [usually not python] Qt, how about <a href="http://www.kde.org/" rel="nofollow">KDE</a>?</p>

<p>as for Python, its just a language... all Qt Apps look/feel the same no matter which language bindings you use.  Can your friend tell the difference between your app and any native KDE app using Qt?</p>

Outside of the Python world, I know a handful of KDE's widgets are constructed with it -- for instance the printer configuration utility.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.qgis.org/" rel="nofollow">Quantum GIS</a> is a C++ Application which provides a Python Console as well as API for developing plugins. A rich set of plugins have been developed using PyQt for this application.</p>

<p><a href="http://bibus-biblio.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main%5FPage" rel="nofollow">Bibus</a> also uses Python but with wx-widgets for GUI elements. So you do not always have to use Qt.</p>

<p>Python + Qt provides an very fast means or rapidly developing working cross-platform GUI applications and I see no problems with this approach.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>There are plenty of applications on Ubuntu that use PyQT.  Although I'd recommend checking out <a href="http://www.pyside.org/" rel="nofollow">PySide</a>.  It's LGPL-licensed so you don't have to use the GPL for your code.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Calibre - probably the most well featured book reader/organizer(Can read most formats, Converts beetween formats,looks up and downloads metadata).</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I'd like to comment from a user's perspective.
Although I use Python myself, I hate to installing dependency libraries and sometimes there are version incompatibility issues. If your software is general purpose and you want it to reach a large audience, I don't suggest you to use PyQt. </p>

<p>It is perfect for prototyping. It is also good for specialized software, because you will help deploy and do consulting with the software. </p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>The configuration UI for HP printers under linux uses PyQt and they're in the standard Ubuntu repositories.</p>
