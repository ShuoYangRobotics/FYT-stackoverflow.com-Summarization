<h3>Question (ID-1583148):</h3><h2>Python: Int not iterable errror</h2><p>I'm attempting to get my feet wet with python on Project Euler, but I'm having an issue with the first problem (find the sum of the multiples of 3 or 5 up to 1,000). I can successfully print out multiples of three and five, but when I attempt to include the sum function I get the following error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Any help would be appreciated. </p>

<pre><code>n = 100
p = 0
while p&lt;n:
   p = p + 1
x = range(0, p)

# check to see if numbers are divisable by 3 or 5
def numcheck(x): 
   for numbers in x:
      if numbers%3==0 and numbers%5==0:
          sum(numbers)
numcheck(x)
</code></pre>

<p>"numbers" steps through the elements in x one at a time, for each pass through the loop.
It would be perhaps better to name the variable "number" because you are only getting
one number at a time. "numbers" equals an integer each time through the loop.</p>

<pre><code>sum(numbers)
</code></pre>

<p>throws a TypeError because the function sum() expects an iterable object (like a list of numbers), not just one integer.</p>

<p>So perhaps try:</p>

<pre><code>def numcheck(x):
    s=0
    for number in x:
        if number%3==0 and number%5==0:
            s+=number
    print(s)
numcheck(range(1000))
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>numbers needs to be a list or similar when it is passed to sum(). In the code example above, it is an integer - one of the integers from x.</p>

<p>Try something like:</p>

<pre><code>numbers = [num for num in x if num%3==0 and num%5 ==0]
print sum(numbers)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>The <code>sum</code> function expects a list, not a single number.</p>

<p>When you do <code>for numbers in</code>, then the variable <code>numbers</code> has a single integer object.  Add a <code>print</code> statement, you'll see that <code>numbers</code> is a single number.</p>

<p>You might want to accumulate all the multiples of 3 and 5 in a list.  Once you have the list, you can then use the <code>sum</code> function on that list.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I think you want something like what follows.</p>

<pre><code>def numcheck(x):
    total = 0
    for number in x:
        if number % 3 == 0 or and number % 5 == 0:
            total += number
    print total
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, you could append each of the divisible numbers to a list, and then call sum() on that list.</p>

<p>sum(...)
    sum(sequence[, start]) -> value</p>

<pre><code>Returns the sum of a sequence of numbers (NOT strings) plus the value
of parameter 'start' (which defaults to 0).  When the sequence is
empty, returns start.
</code></pre>

<p>(END) </p>

<p>You are passing numbers which is of type int to sum(), but sum takes a sequence.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Here is how I would do this:</p>

<pre><code>n = 100

# the next 4 lines are just to confirm that xrange is n numbers starting at 0
junk = xrange(n)
print junk[0]  # print first number in sequence
print junk[-1] # print last number in sequence
print "================"

# check to see if numbers are divisable by 3 or 5
def numcheck(x): 
   for numbers in x:
      if numbers%3==0 and numbers%5==0:
          print numbers

numcheck(xrange(n))
</code></pre>

<p>You may find it strange that I pass xrange(n) as a parameter. This is an iterator that
will eventually produce the list of n numbers as you go through the loop in numcheck. It's a bit like passing a pointer to a function in C. The key thing is that by using xrange, you do not need to allocate any memory for the list of numbers, so you can more easily run a check on the first billion integers, for instance.</p>
