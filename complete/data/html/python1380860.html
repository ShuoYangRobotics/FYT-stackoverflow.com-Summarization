<h3>Question (ID-1380860):</h3><h2>add variables to tuple</h2><p>i am learning python and creating a database connection.
while trying to add to the db, i am thinking of creating tuples out of information and then add them to the db. </p>

<p>WHAT I AM DOING:
i am taking info from the user and store them in variables. 
can i add these variables into a tuple? can you please help me with the syntax?</p>

<p>also if there is an efficient way of doing this, please share...</p>

<p>thanks a lot.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>
Let me edit this question a bit...I only need the tuple to enter info into the DB. once the info is added to the DB, should I delete the tuple? i mean i dont need the tuple anymore.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Tuples are immutable; you can't change which variables they contain after construction. However, you can concatenate or slice them to form new tuples:</p>

<pre><code>a = (1, 2, 3)
b = a + (4, 5, 6)
c = b[1:]
</code></pre>

<p>And, of course, build them from existing values:</p>

<pre><code>   name = "Joe"
   age = 40
   location = "New York"
   joe = (name, age, location)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>It's as easy as the following:</p>

<pre><code>info_1 = "one piece of info"
info_2 = "another piece"
vars = (info_1, info_2)
# 'vars' is now a tuple with the values ("info_1", "info_2")
</code></pre>

<p>However, tuples in Python are <em>immutable</em>, so you cannot append variables to a tuple once it is created.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You can start with a blank tuple with something like t = (). You can add with +, but you have to add another tuple. If you want to add a single element, make it a singleton: t = t + (element,). You can add a tuple of multiple elements with or without that trailing comma.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = ()
&gt;&gt;&gt; t = t + (1,)
&gt;&gt;&gt; t
(1,)
&gt;&gt;&gt; t = t + (2,)
&gt;&gt;&gt; t
(1, 2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; t = t + (3, 4, 5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; t
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; t = t + (6, 7, 8,)
&gt;&gt;&gt; t
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I'm pretty sure the syntax for this in python is:</p>

<pre><code>user_input1 = raw_input("Enter Name: ")
user_input2 = raw_input("Enter Value: ")
info = (user_input1, user_input2)
</code></pre>

<p>once set, tuples cannot be changed.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>As other answers have noted, you cannot change an existing tuple, but you can always create a new tuple (which may take some or all items from existing tuples and/or other sources).</p>

<p>For example, if all the items of interest are in scalar variables and you know the names of those variables:</p>

<pre><code>def maketuple(variables, names):
  return tuple(variables[n] for n in names)
</code></pre>

<p>to be used, e.g, as in this example:</p>

<pre><code>def example():
  x = 23
  y = 45
  z = 67
  return maketuple(vars(), 'x y z'.split())
</code></pre>

<p>of course this one case would be more simply expressed as <code>(x, y, z)</code> (or even foregoing the names altogether, <code>(23, 45, 67)</code>), but the <code>maketuple</code> approach might be useful in some more complicated cases (e.g. where the names to use are also determined dynamically and appended to a list during the computation).</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p><strong>" once the info is added to the DB, should I delete the tuple? i mean i dont need the tuple anymore."</strong></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Generally, there's no reason to delete anything.  There are some special cases for deleting, but they're very, very rare.</p>

<p>Simply define a narrow scope (i.e., a function definition or a method function in a class) and the objects will be garbage collected at the end of the scope.</p>

<p>Don't worry about deleting anything.</p>

<p>[Note.  I worked with a guy who -- in addition to trying to delete objects -- was always writing "reset" methods to clear them out.  Like he was going to save them and reuse them.  Also a silly conceit.  Just ignore the objects you're no longer using.  If you define your functions in small-enough blocks of code, you have nothing more to think about.]</p>
