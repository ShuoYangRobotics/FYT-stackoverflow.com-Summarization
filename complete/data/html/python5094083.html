<h3>Question (ID-5094083):</h3><h2>find the "overlap" between 2 python lists</h2><p>Given 2 lists:</p>

<pre><code>a = [3,4,5,5,5,6]
b = [1,3,4,4,5,5,6,7]
</code></pre>

<p>I want to find the "overlap":</p>

<pre><code>c = [3,4,5,5,6]
</code></pre>

<p>I'd also like it if i could extract the "remainder" the part of a and b that's not in c.</p>

<pre><code>a_remainder = [5,]
b_remainder = [1,4,7,]
</code></pre>

<p>Note:
a has three 5's in it and b has two.
b has two 4's in it and a has one.</p>

<p>The resultant list c should have two 5's (limited by list b) and one 4 (limited by list a).</p>

<p>This gives me what i want, but I can't help but think there's a much better way.</p>

<pre><code>import copy

a = [3,4,5,5,5,6]
b = [1,3,4,4,5,5,6,7]

c = []
for elem in copy.deepcopy(a):
    if elem in b:
        a.pop(a.index(elem))
        c.append(b.pop(b.index(elem)))

# now a and b both contain the "remainders" and c contains the "overlap"
</code></pre>

<p>On another note, what is a more accurate name for what I'm asking for than "overlap" and "remainder"?</p>

<p>edit: In the original post, I  had mistakenly typed that the desired result was a_remainder == [4,] -- Andrew Jaffe correctly pointed out that a_remainder should be [5,].</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p><code>collection.Counter</code> available in Python 2.7 can be used to implement multisets that do exactly what you want.</p>

<pre><code>a = [3,4,5,5,5,6]
b = [1,3,4,4,5,5,6,7]

a_multiset = collections.Counter(a)
b_multiset = collections.Counter(b)

overlap = list((a_multiset &amp; b_multiset).elements())
a_remainder = list((a_multiset - b_multiset).elements())
b_remainder = list((b_multiset - a_multiset).elements())

print intersection, a_remainder, b_remainder
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>In the language of sets, overlap is 'intersection' and remainder is 'set difference'.  If you had distinct items, you wouldn't have to do these operations yourself, check out <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/sets.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/library/sets.html</a> if you're interested.</p>

<p>Since we're not working with distinct elements, your approach is reasonable.  If you wanted this to run faster, you could create a dictionary for each list and map the number to how many elements are in each array (e.g., in a, 3->1, 4->1, 5->2, etc.).  You would then iterate through map a, determine if that letter existed, decrement its count and add it to the new list</p>

<p>Untested code, but this is the idea</p>

<pre><code>def add_or_update(map,value):
    if value in map:
        map[value]+=1
    else
        map[value]=1

b_dict = dict()
for b_elem in b:
    add_or_update(b_dict,b_elem)

intersect = []; diff = [];

for a_elem in a:
    if a_elem in b_dict and b_dict[a_elem]&gt;0:
        intersect.add(a_elem);

for k,v in diff:
    for i in range(v):
        diff.add(k);
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>OK, verbose, but kind of cool (similar in spirit to the <code>collections.Counter</code> idea, but more home-made):</p>

<pre><code>import itertools as it
flatten = it.chain.from_iterable 
sorted(
   v for u,v in 
    set(flatten(enumerate(g) 
        for k, g in it.groupby(a))).intersection(
    set(flatten(enumerate(g)
        for k, g in it.groupby(b))))
   )
</code></pre>

<p>The basic idea is to make each of the lists into a new list which attaches a counter to each object, numbered to account for duplicates -- so that then you can then use <code>set</code> operations on these tuples after all.</p>

<p>To be slightly less verbose:</p>

<pre><code> aa = set(flatten(enumerate(g) for k, g in it.groupby(a)))
 bb = set(flatten(enumerate(g) for k, g in it.groupby(b)))
 # aa = set([(0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 5)])
 # bb = set([(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 4), (1, 5)])

 cc = aa.intersection(bb)
 # cc = set([(0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5)])
 c = sorted(v for u,v in cc)
 # c = [3, 4, 5, 5, 6]
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><code>groupby</code> -- produces a list of lists containing identical elements
(but because of the syntax needs the <code>g for k,g in it.groupby(a)</code> to extract each list)</li>
<li><code>enumerate</code> -- appends a counter to each element of each sublist</li>
<li><code>flatten</code> -- create a single list</li>
<li><code>set</code> -- convert to a set</li>
<li><code>intersection</code> -- find the common elements</li>
<li><code>sorted(v for u,v in cc)</code> -- get rid of the counters and sort the result</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, I'm not sure what you mean by the remainders; it seems like it ought to be my <code>aa-cc</code> and <code>bb-cc</code> but I don't know where you get <code>a_remainder = [4]</code>:</p>

<pre><code>sorted(v for u,v in aa-cc)
# [5]

sorted(v for u,v in bb-cc)
# [1, 4, 7]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>A response from kerio in #python on freenode:</p>

<pre><code>[ i for i in itertools.chain.from_iterable([k] * v for k, v in \
  (Counter(a) &amp; Counter(b)).iteritems())
]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Try <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/difflib.html#difflib.SequenceMatcher" rel="nofollow">difflib.SequenceMatcher()</a>, "a flexible class for comparing pairs of sequences of any type"...</p>

<p>A quick try:</p>

<pre><code>a = [3,4,5,5,5,6]
b = [1,3,4,4,5,5,6,7]

sm = difflib.SequenceMatcher(None, a, b)
c = []
a_remainder = []
b_remainder = []

for tag, i1, i2, j1, j2 in sm.get_opcodes():
    if tag == 'replace':
        a_remainder.extend(a[i1:i2])
        b_remainder.extend(b[j1:j2])
    elif tag == 'delete':
        a_remainder.extend(a[i1:i2])
    elif tag == 'insert':
        b_remainder.extend(b[j1:j2])
    elif tag == 'equal':
        c.extend(a[i1:i2])
</code></pre>

<p>And now...</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print c
[3, 4, 5, 5, 6]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print a_remainder
[5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print b_remainder
[1, 4, 7]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><pre><code>Aset = Set(a);
Bset = Set(b);
a_remainder = a.difference(b);
b_remainder = b.difference(a);
c = a.intersection(b);
</code></pre>

<p>But if you need <code>c</code> to have duplicates, and order is important for you,<br>
you may look for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem" rel="nofollow">w:Longest common subsequence problem</a></p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Use python set</p>

<pre><code>intersection = set(a) &amp; set(b)
a_remainder = set(a) - set(b)
b_remainder = set(b) - set(a)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>I don't think you should actually use this solution, but I took this opportunity to practice with lambda functions and here is what I came up with :)</p>

<pre><code>a = [3,4,5,5,5,6]
b = [1,3,4,4,5,5,6,7]
dedup = lambda x: [set(x)] if len(set(x)) == len(x) else [set(x)] + dedup([x[i] for i in range(1, len(x)) if x[i] == x[i-1]])
default_set = lambda x: (set() if x[0] is None else x[0], set() if x[1] is None else x[1])
deduped = map(default_set, map(None, dedup(a), dedup(b)))
get_result = lambda f: reduce(lambda x, y: list(x) + list(y), map(lambda x: f(x[0], x[1]), deduped))
c = get_result(lambda x, y: x.intersection(y))          # [3, 4, 5, 6, 5]
a_remainder = get_result(lambda x, y: x.difference(y))  # [5]
b_remainder = get_result(lambda x, y: y.difference(x))  # [1, 7, 4]
</code></pre>

<p>I'm pretty sure <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/itertools.html#itertools.izip_longest" rel="nofollow">izip_longest</a> would have simplified this a bit (wouldn't have needed the <code>default_set</code> lambda), but I was testing this with Python 2.5.</p>

<p>Here are some of the intermediate values used in the calculation in case anyone wants to understand this:</p>

<pre><code>dedup(a) = [set([3, 4, 5, 6]), set([5]), set([5])]
dedup(b) = [set([1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]), set([4, 5])]
deduped = [(set([3, 4, 5, 6]), set([1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])), (set([5]), set([4, 5])), (set([5]), set([]))]
