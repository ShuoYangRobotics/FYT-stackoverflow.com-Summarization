<h3>Question (ID-1513727):</h3><h2>Python .sort() not working as expected</h2><p>Tackling a few puzzle problems on a quiet Saturday night (wooohoo... not) and am struggling with sort(). The results aren't quite what I expect. The program iterates through every combination from 100 - 999 and checks if the product is a palindome. If it is, append to the list. I need the list sorted :D Here's my program:</p>

<pre><code>list = [] #list of numbers

for x in xrange(100,1000): #loops for first value of combination
  for y in xrange(x,1000): #and 2nd value
    mult = x*y
    reversed = str(mult)[::-1] #reverses the number
    if (reversed == str(mult)):
      list.append(reversed)

list.sort()
print list[:10]
</code></pre>

<p>which nets:</p>

<pre><code>['101101', '10201', '102201', '102201', '105501', '105501', '106601', '108801',
'108801', '110011']
</code></pre>

<p>Clearly index 0 is larger then 1. Any idea what's going on? I have a feeling it's got something to do with trailing/leading zeroes, but I had a quick look and I can't see the problem.</p>

<p>Bonus points if you know where the puzzle comes from :P</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You are sorting strings, not numbers. <code>'101101' &lt; '10201'</code> because <code>'1' &lt; '2'</code>. Change <code>list.append(reversed)</code> to <code>list.append(int(reversed))</code> and it will work (or use a different sorting function).</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Sort is doing its job. If you intended to store integers in the list, take Lukáš advice. You can also tell sort how to sort, for example by making ints:</p>

<pre><code>list.sort(key=int)
</code></pre>

<p>the key parameter takes a function that calculates an item to take the list object's place in all comparisons. An integer will compare numerically as you expect.</p>

<p>(By the way, <code>list</code> is a really bad variable name, as you override the builtin list() type!)</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>No need to convert to int.  mult already is an int and as you have checked it is a palindrome it will look the same as reversed,  so just:</p>

<pre><code>list.append(mult)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You have your numbers stored as strings, so python is sorting them accordingly.  So: '101x' comes before '102x' (the same way that 'abcd' will come before 'az').</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>No, it is sorting properly, just that it is sorting <strong>lexographically</strong> and you want <strong>numeric</strong> sorting... so remove the "str()"</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You're sorting strings, not numbers. Strings compare left-to-right.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Your list contains strings so it is sorting them alphabetically - try converting the list to integers and then do the sort.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>The comparator operator is treating your input as strings instead of integers. In string comparsion 2 as the 3rd letter is lexically greater than 1.
<code>
reversed = str(mult)[::-1]
</code></p>
