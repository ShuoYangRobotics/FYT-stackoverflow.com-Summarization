<h3>Question (ID-386753):</h3><h2>How do I convert part of a python tuple (byte array) into an integer</h2><p>I am trying to talk to a device using python.  I have been handed a tuple of bytes which contains the storage information.  How can I convert the data into the correct values:</p>

<p>response = (0, 0, 117, 143, 6)</p>

<p>The first 4 values are a 32-bit int telling me how many bytes have been used and the last value is the percentage used.</p>

<p>I can access the tuple as response[0] but cannot see how I can get the first 4 values into the int I require.</p>

<p>You probably want to use the struct module, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>import struct

response = (0, 0, 117, 143, 6)
struct.unpack("&gt;I", ''.join([chr(x) for x in response[:-1]]))
</code></pre>

<p>Assuming an unsigned int. There may be a better way to do the conversion to unpack, a list comprehension with join was just the first thing that I came up with. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: See also ΤΖΩΤΖΙΟΥ's comment on this answer regarding endianness as well.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT #2</strong>: If you don't mind using the array module as well, here is an alternate method that obviates the need for a list comprehension. Thanks to @<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/386753/how-do-i-convert-part-of-a-python-tuple-byte-array-into-an-integer#386998">JimB</a> for pointing out that unpack can operate on arrays as well.</p>

<pre><code>import struct
from array import array

response = (0, 0, 117, 143, 6)
bytes = array('B', response[:-1])
struct.unpack('&gt;I', bytes)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Would,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>num = (response[0] &lt;&lt; 24) +
  (response[1] &lt;&lt; 16) + (response[2] &lt;&lt;
  8) + response[3]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>meet your needs?</p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You could also make use of the array module</p>

<pre><code>import struct
from array import array
response = (0, 0, 117, 143, 6)
a = array('B', response[:4])
struct.unpack('&gt;I', a)

(30095L,)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>OK, You don't specify the endinanness or whether the integer is signed or and it (perhaps)  is faster to with the struct module but:</p>

<pre><code>b = (8, 1, 0, 0)
sum(b[i] &lt;&lt; (i * 8) for i in range(4))
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>How about using the map function:</p>

<pre><code>a = (0, 0, 117, 143, 6)
b = []
map(b.append, a)
</code></pre>

<p>Also, I don't know if this is you are looking for:</p>

<pre><code>response = (0, 0, 117, 143, 6)
response[0:4]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>This looks like a job for reduce!</p>

<p>What you basically need is to, bit-shift a byte at a time, and then add (addition) the next byte in the sequence. </p>

<pre><code>a = (0, 0, 117, 143, 6)
reduce(lambda x, y: (x&lt;&lt;8) + y, a)
7704326
</code></pre>
