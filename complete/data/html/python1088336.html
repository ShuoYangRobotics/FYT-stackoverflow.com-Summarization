<h3>Question (ID-1088336):</h3><h2>ftplib checking if a file is a folder?</h2><p>How can i check if a file on a remote ftp is a folder or not using ftplib?</p>

<p>Best way i have right now is to do a nlst, and iterate through calling size on each of the files, if the file errors out then it is a folder?</p>

<p>Is there a better way? I cannot parse the output of list, since there is about a dozen different ftp servers(many extremely old.)</p>

<p>What should i do?</p>

<p>If getting the size of each node doesn't work, perhaps you should consider calling <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/ftplib.html#ftplib.FTP.nlst" rel="nofollow"><code>FTP.nlst()</code></a> on each of those nodes: those that error out will be files rather than dirs.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><a href="http://docs.python.org/library/ftplib.html?highlight=ftplib#ftplib.FTP.dir" rel="nofollow"><code>FTP.dir</code></a> returns a directory listing, that you can parse with a callback function to find out whether it's a directory. For example, like this:</p>

<pre><code>def parse(line):
    if line[0] == 'd':
        print(line.rpartition(' ')[2])   # gives you the name of a directory

ftp.dir(parse)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><pre><code>def is_file(filename):
    return ftp.size(filename) is not None
</code></pre>

<p>This works because ftp.size returns None if it is a directory.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><pre><code>def is_file(filename):
    current = ftp.pwd()
    try:
        ftp.cwd(filename)
    except:
        ftp.cwd(current)
        return True
    ftp.cwd(current)
    return False
</code></pre>

<p>Here is another solution. Half way writing it out I realized it has a problem. If you don't have permission to change to a folder, it'll read it as a file instead. It'll work if you have access to any folder. </p>

<p>I still posted it because maybe it'll give some ideas.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I'm running into this concern now too.  I suppose no more progress has been made?  Also I'm wondering if an sftp solution is available yet.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You can use MLST command:</p>

<pre><code>import ftplib
f = ftplib.FTP()
f.connect("localhost")
f.login()
print f.sendcmd('MLST /')
</code></pre>

<p>Against <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pyftpdlib/" rel="nofollow">pyftpdlib server</a> the code above prints:</p>

<pre><code>250-Listing "/":
 modify=20111212124834;perm=el;size=12288;type=dir;unique=807g100001; /
250 End MLST.
</code></pre>

<p>What you have to do is parse that string and look for "type=dir" or "type=cdir" (current dir, as in ".") or "type=pdir" (parent dir as in "..") via a regular expression.
If you get a match, it means that the provided path refers to a directory.</p>
