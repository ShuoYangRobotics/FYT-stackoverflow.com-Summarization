<h3>Question (ID-2211990):</h3><h2>How to implement an efficient infinite generator of prime numbers in Python?</h2><p>This is not a homework, I am just curious.</p>

<p>INFINITE is the key word here.</p>

<p>I wish to use it as for p in primes(). I believe that this is a built-in function in Haskell.</p>

<p>So, the answer cannot be as naive as "Just do a Sieve".</p>

<p>First of all, you do not know how many consecutive primes will be consumed. Well, suppose you could concoct 100 of them at a time. Would you use the same Sieve approach as well as the frequency of prime numbers formula?</p>

<p>I prefer non-concurrent approach.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading (and writing ;) )!</p>

This was recently discussed on Stack Overflow (search for the authors' names, I guess) and somebody proposed a substantially faster (but IMHO less clear) version;-).</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><h1>“If I have seen further…”</h1>

<p>The <code>erat2</code> function from the cookbook can be further sped up (by about 20-25%):</p>

<h2>erat2a</h2>

<pre><code>import itertools as it
def erat2a( ):
    D = {  }
    yield 2
    for q in it.islice(it.count(3), 0, None, 2):
        p = D.pop(q, None)
        if p is None:
            D[q*q] = q
            yield q
        else:
            # old code here:
            # x = p + q
            # while x in D or not (x&amp;1):
            #     x += p
            # changed into:
            x = q + 2*p
            while x in D:
                x += 2*p
            D[x] = p
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>not (x&amp;1)</code> check verifies that <code>x</code> is odd. However, since <em>both</em> <code>q</code> and <code>p</code> are odd, by adding <code>2*p</code> half of the steps are avoided along with the test for oddity.</p>

<h2>erat3</h2>

<p>If one doesn't mind a little extra fanciness, <code>erat2</code> can be sped up by 35-40% with the following changes (NB: needs Python 2.7+ or Python 3+ because of the <code>itertools.compress</code> function):</p>

<pre><code>import itertools as it
def erat3( ):
    D = { 9: 3, 25: 5 }
    yield 2
    yield 3
    yield 5
    MASK= 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0,
    MODULOS= frozenset( (1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29) )

    for q in it.compress(
            it.islice(it.count(7), 0, None, 2),
            it.cycle(MASK)):
        p = D.pop(q, None)
        if p is None:
            D[q*q] = q
            yield q
        else:
            x = q + 2*p
            while x in D or (x%30) not in MODULOS:
                x += 2*p
            D[x] = p
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>erat3</code> function takes advantage of the fact that all primes (except for  2, 3, 5) modulo 30 result to only eight numbers: the ones included in the <code>MODULOS</code> frozenset. Thus, after yielding the initial three primes, we start from 7 and work <em>only</em> with the candidates.<br>
The candidate filtering uses the <code>itertools.compress</code> function; the “magic” is in the <code>MASK</code> sequence; <code>MASK</code> has 15 elements (there are 15 odd numbers in every 30 numbers, as chosen by the <code>itertools.islice</code> function) with a <code>1</code> for every possible candidate, starting from 7. The cycle repeats as specified by the <code>itertools.cycle</code> function.<br>
The introduction of the candidate filtering needs another modification: the <code>or (x%30) not in MODULOS</code> check. The <code>erat2</code> algorithm processed all odd numbers; now that the <code>erat3</code> algorithm processes only r30 candidates, we need to make sure that all <code>D.keys()</code> can only be such —false— candidates.</p>

<h3>Benchmark code</h3>

<p>A <code>primegen.py</code> module contains the <code>erat2</code>, <code>erat2a</code> and <code>erat3</code> functions. Here follows the testing script:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
max_num=${1:-8192}
echo up to $max_num
for python_version in python2 python3
do
    for function in erat2 erat2a erat3
    do
        echo "==== $python_version $function ===="
        $python_version -O -m timeit -c \
        -s  "import itertools as it, functools as ft, operator as op, primegen; cmp= ft.partial(op.ge, $max_num)" \
            "next(it.dropwhile(cmp, primegen.$function()))"
    done

<pre><code>def gen_primes():
  D = {}
  q = 2  # first integer to test for primality.

  while True:
    if q not in D:
      # not marked composite, must be prime  
      yield q 

      #first multiple of q not already marked
      D[q * q] = [q] 
    else:
      for p in D[q]:
        D.setdefault(p + q, []).append(p)
      # no longer need D[q], free memory
      del D[q]

    q += 1
</code></pre>

<p>It's a generator, so use it like any other.</p>

<pre><code>primes = gen_primes()
for p in primes:
  print p
</code></pre>

<p>It takes 1.62s to generate and put into a set, 1 million primes, on my desktop.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Do a <em>sliced</em> sieve, where the size of a slice is determined by available memory or the maximal size of a bitset.</p>

<p>For each slice represent the numbers in some interval [n; n + slice_size) as a bit set and sieve with all prime numbers below the square root of the upper bound.</p>

<p>Using a bit set uses less memory than a hash table or tree data structure, because you are working with dense sets of numbers.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Here's a generator that's a little truer to how it's done in Haskell: filtering against composites of known primes, then adding the remaining primes to the list.</p>

<pre><code>def gen_primes():
    primes = []
    i = 2
    while True:
        prime = True
        for p in primes:
            if not (i % p):
                prime = False
                break
        if prime:
            yield i
            primes.append(i)
        i += 1
</code></pre>

<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>And another answer, more memory-efficient than my <code>erat3</code> answer here:</p>

<pre><code>import heapq

def heapprimegen():
    hp= []
    yield 2
    cn= 3
    nn, inc= 3, 6
    while 1:
        while cn &lt; nn:
            yield cn
            heapq.heappush(hp, (3*cn, 2*cn))
            cn+= 2
        cn= nn+2
        nn, inc= heapq.heappushpop(hp, (nn+inc, inc))
</code></pre>

<p>It maintains a heap (a list) of prime multiples rather than a dictionary. It loses some speed, obviously.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Another way to do it:</p>

<pre><code>import itertools
def primeseq():
    prime = [2]
    num = 0
    yield 2
    for i in itertools.count(3, 2):
        is_prime = True
        for num in prime:
            if i % num == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
            elif num ** 2 &gt; i: 
                break
        if is_prime:
            prime.append(i)
            yield i
</code></pre>
