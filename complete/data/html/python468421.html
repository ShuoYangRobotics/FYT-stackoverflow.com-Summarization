<h3>Question (ID-468421):</h3><h2>Ruby equivalent of Python's "dir"?</h2><p>In Python we can "dir" a module, like this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import re
&gt;&gt;&gt; dir(re)
</code></pre>

<p>And it lists all functions in the module. Is there a similar way to do this in Ruby?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-9):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>As far as I know not exactly but you get somewhere with</p>

<pre><code>object.methods.sort
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I like to have this in my .irbrc:</p>

<pre><code>class Object
  def local_methods
    (methods - Object.instance_methods).sort
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>So when I'm in irb:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; Time.now.local_methods 
=&gt; ["+", "-", "&lt;", "&lt;=", "&lt;=&gt;", "&gt;", "&gt;=", "_dump", "asctime", "between?", "ctime", "day", "dst?", "getgm", "getlocal", "getutc", "gmt?", "gmt_offset", "gmtime", "gmtoff", "hour", "isdst", "localtime", "mday", "min", "mon", "month", "sec", "strftime", "succ", "to_f", "to_i", "tv_sec", "tv_usec", "usec", "utc", "utc?", "utc_offset", "wday", "yday", "year", "zone"]
</code></pre>

<p>Or even cuter - with grep:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; Time.now.local_methods.grep /str/
=&gt; ["strftime"]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You can take a module, such as <code>Enumerable</code>, and send the <code>methods</code> method which lists all the methods the module defines. Classes that include this module will respond to these methods.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; Enumerable.methods
=&gt; ["inspect", "private_class_method", "const_missing", "clone", "method", "public_methods", "public_instance_methods", "instance_variable_defined?", "method_defined?", "equal?", "freeze", "included_modules", "const_get", "yaml_as", "methods", "respond_to?", "module_eval", "class_variables", "dup", "protected_instance_methods", "instance_variables", "public_method_defined?", "__id__", "object_id", "taguri", "yaml_tag_read_class", "eql?", "const_set", "id", "to_yaml", "taguri=", "singleton_methods", "send", "class_eval", "taint", "frozen?", "instance_variable_get", "include?", "private_instance_methods", "__send__", "instance_of?", "private_method_defined?", "to_a", "name", "to_yaml_style", "autoload", "type", "yaml_tag_class_name", "&lt;", "protected_methods", "instance_eval", "&lt;=&gt;", "==", "&gt;", "display", "===", "instance_method", "instance_variable_set", "to_yaml_properties", "kind_of?", "extend", "protected_method_defined?", "const_defined?", "&gt;=", "ancestors", "to_s", "&lt;=", "public_class_method", "hash", "class", "instance_methods", "tainted?", "=~", "private_methods", "class_variable_defined?", "nil?", "untaint", "constants", "autoload?", "is_a?"]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Tip for "searching" for a method in irb: </p>

<pre><code>"something".methods.select {|item| item =~ /query/ }
</code></pre>

<p>Tip for trying out methods on a value for comparison:</p>

<pre><code>value = "something"
[:upcase, :downcase, :capitalize].collect {|method| [method, value.send(method)] }
</code></pre>

<p>Also, note that you won't get all the same information as Python's dir with object.methods. You have to use a combination of object.methods and class.constants, also class.singleton_methods to get the class methods.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I've asked a similar question previously here:</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/228648/how-do-you-list-the-currently-available-objects-in-the-current-scope-in-ruby">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/228648/how-do-you-list-the-currently-available-objects-in-the-current-scope-in-ruby</a></p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I'd go for something like this:</p>

<pre><code>y String.methods.sort
</code></pre>

<p>Which will give you a yaml representation of the sorted array of methods. Note that this can be used to list the methods of both classes and objects.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Not really.  Like the others said, you can get part of what you want by listing class instance methods (e.g. <code>String.instance_methods</code>) but that doesn't help you if a file you open reopens a class (unless you check before and after).</p>

<p>If you don't need programmatic access to the list of methods, consider checking out the documentation for a class, module or method using the <code>ri</code> command line tool.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>I would have made this a comment to jonelf's answer, but apparently I don't have enough rep.</p>

<p>some_object.methods.sort - Object.new.methods</p>

<p>This isn't exactly what you were asking as others have said, but it gives you the info you are after.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>If I stricly read your question, I must answer it that way: a file as specified by <code>require</code> in Ruby is just a container and does not have necessarely have any relation with a class.  The content can be:</p>

<ul>
<li>a class</li>
<li>a module</li>
<li>plain code</li>
</ul>

<p>or any combination of the above, several times. So you can not directly ask for all methods in a given file.</p>

<p>If you meant to list all methods of a given module or class, then the other answers are what you seek (mainly using the <code>#methods</code> method on a module name or class).</p>
