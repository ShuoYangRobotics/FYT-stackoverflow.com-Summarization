<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The module is not likely in your python search path..</p>

<p>Check to see if that module is in your <em>Python Path</em>... In windows...you may find it in the registry</p>

<p>HKLM\Software\Python\PythonCore\2.6\PythonPath</p>

<p>Be careful editing it...</p>

<p>You may also alter the Python Path programmaticly by the following</p>

<pre><code>import sys
sys.path.append('somepath_to_the_module_you_wanted')

import the_module_you_wanted
</code></pre>

<p>Hope that helps</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I was having this problem and then I realised I was importing MySQLdb erroneously - it's case sensitive: </p>

<p>Incorrect: >>>import mysqldb</p>

<p>Correct: >>>import MySQLdb</p>

<p>Silly mistake, but cost me a few hours!</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>generally, (good) python modules provide a 'setup.py' script that takes care of things like proper installation (google for 'distutils python').  MySQLdb is a "good" module in this sense.</p>

<p>since you're using windows, things might be a bit more complex.  I assume you already installed MySQLdb following the instructions and it still gives this problem.  what I would do is open a cmd.exe window, cd to the directory containing the 'setup.py' script and there type something like
C:\Python26\Python.exe setup.py install</p>

<p>if this does not work, then grab the module somewhere else, maybe at the place where it is actively developed: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python/" rel="nofollow">http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python/</a></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>See this post on the mysql-python blog: <a href="http://mysql-python.blogspot.com/2009/03/mysql-python-123-beta-2-released.html" rel="nofollow">MySQL-python-1.2.3 beta 2 released</a> - dated March 2009. Looks like MySQLdb for Python 2.6 is still a work in progress...</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I went for compiled binary , thats the best way to go on windows. There is a good source maintained by someone. 
I wrote about it here before because some months down the lane I will forget how I solved this and be searching Stack again :/
