<h3>Question (ID-1025817):</h3><h2>Call program from within a browser without using a webserver</h2><p>Is there a way to call a program (Python script) from a local HTML page?
I have a YUI-colorpicker on that page and need to send its value to a microcontroller via rs232. (There is other stuff than the picker, so I can't code an application instead of an HTML page.)</p>

<p>Later, this will migrate to a server, but I need a fast and easy solution now.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I see now that Daff mentioned the simple HTTP server, but I made an example on how you'd solve your problem (using <code>BaseHTTPServer</code>):</p>

<pre><code>import BaseHTTPServer

HOST_NAME = 'localhost'
PORT_NUMBER = 1337

class MyHandler(BaseHTTPServer.BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(s):
        s.send_response(200)
        s.send_header('Content-Type', 'text/html')
        s.end_headers()

        # Get parameters in query.
        params = {}
        index = s.path.rfind('?')
        if index &gt;= 0:
            parts = s.path[index + 1:].split('&amp;')
            for p in parts:
                try:
                    a, b = p.split('=', 2)
                    params[a] = b
                except:
                    params[p] = ''

        # !!!
        # Check if there is a color parameter and send to controller...
        if 'color' in params:
            print 'Send something to controller...'
        # !!!

        s.wfile.write('&lt;pre&gt;%s&lt;/pre&gt;' % params)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    server_class = BaseHTTPServer.HTTPServer
    httpd = server_class((HOST_NAME, PORT_NUMBER), MyHandler)

    try:
        httpd.serve_forever()
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        pass

    httpd.server_close()
</code></pre>

<p>Now, from your JavaScript, you'd call <code>http://localhost:1337/?color=ffaabb</code></p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Python has a small built in Web server. If you already already got Python to run with the RS232 you might need to read <a href="http://fragments.turtlemeat.com/pythonwebserver.php" rel="nofollow">here</a> on how to set up a very simple and basic webserver.
An even easier one can look like <a href="http://effbot.org/librarybook/simplehttpserver.htm" rel="nofollow">this</a>:</p>

<pre><code>import SimpleHTTPServer
import SocketServer

port = 8000
Handler = SimpleHTTPServer.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler
httpd = SocketServer.TCPServer(("", port), Handler)
httpd.serve_forever()
</code></pre>

<p>Try so separate you source as good as possible, to that you won't have too much trouble to move it to a production ready Python capable webserver.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If you want an an HTML page to have some sort of server-side programming then you will need a webserver of some sort to do the processing.</p>

<p>My suggestion would be to get a web server running on your development box, or try to accomplish what you need to do with a local desktop application or script.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>another quick solution is https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3002
POW, it's a firefox extension that adds a simple web server with Server Side JS built in. </p>

<p>You'd be able to access a command line and call a python script from there.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>No you need some kind of server. Wh not try out the <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=usb%2Bweb%2Bserver&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">portable webservers</a>? You can run them from your usb drive.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Try also XML-RPC it gives you a simple way to pass remote procedure calls from YUI towards a simple XMLRPC server and from that towards your rs232 device</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I see no reason why you can't setup a handler for .py/.bat/.vbs files in your browser. This should result in your chosen application running a script when you link to it. This won't work when you migrate to the server but as a testing platform it would work. Just remember to turn it off when you're done or you expose yourself to viruses from other sites.</p>
