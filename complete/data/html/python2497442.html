<h3>Question (ID-2497442):</h3><h2>Is there any online python exercise?</h2><p>I am teaching a colleague Python and I think he should do some exercises.</p>

<p>Is there any online available other than python challenge?  I feel that python challenge is puzzles, not exercises.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.projecteuler.net" rel="nofollow">Project Euler</a> is a good start.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Probably not what you are looking for, but I recommend the <a href="http://www.oreillyschool.com/" rel="nofollow">O'Reilly School of Technology</a> <a href="http://www.oreillyschool.com/courses/python1/" rel="nofollow">Beginning Python course</a>.  This appears to be the first of four such courses, and though it is commercial, it's been good for me -- I've been using Python in anger for about two years, but have very little formal background programming.  This has been an excellent program that forces me to explore and become familiar with lots of parts of Python I was unaware of, and improving my coding ability and knowledge as well.</p>

<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Try <a href="http://www.cdf.toronto.edu/~csc108h/fall/" rel="nofollow">this</a> and <a href="http://www.cdf.toronto.edu/~csc148h/winter/" rel="nofollow">this</a>.</p>

<p>Those are courses taught at my University that use Python. I've used those assignments to demo/teach python to colleagues before</p>
