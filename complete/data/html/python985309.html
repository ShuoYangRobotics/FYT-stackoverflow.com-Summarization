<h3>Question (ID-985309):</h3><h2>Pythonic way to implement three similar integer range operators?</h2><p>I am working on a circular problem. In this problem, we have objects that are put on a ring of size <code>MAX</code>, and are assigned IDs from (0 to MAX-1).</p>

<p>I have three simple functions to test for range inclusions. inRange(i,j,k) tests if i is in the circular interval [j,k[ (Mnemonic is <em>i inRange(j,k)</em>). And I have the same for ranges ]j,k[ and ]j,k]. </p>

<p>Code in those three methods look duplicated from one method to another:</p>

<pre><code>def inRange(i,j,k):
    """
    Returns True if i in [j, k[
    * 0 &lt;= i, j, k &lt; MAX
    * no order is assumed between j and k: we can have k &lt; j
    """
    if j &lt;= k:
        return j &lt;= i &lt; k
    # j &gt; k :
    return j &lt;= i or i &lt; k

def inStrictRange(i,j,k):
    """
    Returns True if i in ]j, k[
    * 0 &lt;= i, j, k &lt; MAX
    * no order is assumed between j and k: we can have k &lt; j
    """
    if j &lt;= k:
        return j &lt; i &lt; k
    # j &gt; k :
    return j &lt; i or i &lt; k

def inRange2(i,j,k):
    """
    Returns True if i in ]j, k]
    * 0 &lt;= i, j, k &lt; MAX
    * no order is assumed between j and k: we can have k &lt; j
    """
    if j &lt;= k:
        return j &lt; i &lt;= k
    # j &gt; k :
    return j &lt; i or i &lt;= k
</code></pre>

<p>Do you know any cleaner way to implement those three methods? After all, only the operators are changing?!</p>

<p>After thinking of a better solution, I came up with:</p>

<pre><code>from operator import lt, le
def _compare(i,j,k, op1, op2):
    if j &lt;= k:
        return op1(j,i) and op2(i,k)
    return op1(j,i) or op2(i,k)

def inRange(i,j,k):
    return _compare(i,j,k, le, lt)
def inStrictRange(i,j,k):
    return _compare(i,j,k, lt, lt)
def inRange2(i,j,k):
    return _compare(i,j,k, lt, le)
</code></pre>

<p>Is it any better? Can you come up with something more intuitive?
In short, <em>what would be the Pythonic way to write these three operators?</em></p>

<p>Also, I hate the inRange, inStrictRange, inRange2 names, but I can't think of crystal-clear names. Any ideas?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Two <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/" rel="nofollow" title="PEP 20: The Zen of Python">Zen of Python</a> principles leap to mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>Simple is better than complex.</li>
<li>There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it.</li>
</ul>

<h1><code>range</code></h1>

<p>The Python built-in function <code>range(start, end)</code> generates a list from <code>start</code> to <code>end</code>.<sup>1</sup> The first element of that list is <code>start</code>, and the last element is <code>end - 1</code>.</p>

<p>There is no <code>range_strict</code> function or <code>inclusive_range</code> function. This was very awkward to me when I started in Python. ("I just want a list from <code>a</code> to <code>b</code> inclusive! How hard is that, Guido?") However, the convention used in calling the <code>range</code> function was simple and easy to remember, and the lack of multiple functions made it easy to remember exactly how to generate a range every time.</p>

<h1>Recommendation</h1>

<p>As you've probably guessed, my recommendation is to only create a function to test whether <em>i</em> is in the range [<em>j</em>, <em>k</em>). In fact, my recommendation is to keep only your existing <code>inRange</code> function.</p>

<p>(Since your question specifically mentions Pythonicity, I would recommend you name the function as <code>in_range</code> to better fit with the <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow" title="PEP 8: Style Guide for Python Code">Python Style Guide</a>.)</p>

<h1>Justification</h1>

<p>Why is this a good idea?</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>The single function is easy to understand. It is very easy to learn how to use it.</em></p>

<p>Of course, the same could be said for each of your three starting functions. So far so good.</p></li>
<li><p><em>There is only one function to learn. There are not three functions with necessarily similar names.</em></p>

<p>Given the similar names and behaviours of your three functions, it is somewhat possible that you will, at some point, use the wrong function. This is compounded by the fact that the functions return the same value except for edge cases, which could lead to a hard-to-find off-by-one bug. By only making one function available, you know you will not make such a mistake.</p></li>
<li><p><em>The function is easy to edit.</em></p>

<p>It is unlikely that you'll need to ever debug or edit such an easy piece of code. However, should you need to do so, you need only edit this one function. With your original three functions, you have to make the same edit in three places. With your revised code in your self-answer, the code is made slightly less intuitive by the operator obfuscation.</p></li>
<li><p><em>The "size" of the range is obvious.</em></p>

<p>For a given ring where you would use <code>inRange(i, j, k)</code>, it is obvious how many elements would be covered by the range [<em>j</em>, <em>k</em>). Here it is in code.</p>

<pre><code>if j &lt;= k:
    size = k - j
if j &gt; k:
    size = k - j + MAX
</code></pre>

<p>So therefore</p>

<pre><code>size = (k - j) % MAX
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<h1>Caveats</h1>

<p>I'm approaching this problem from a completely generic point of view, such as that of a person writing a function for a publicly-released library. Since I don't know your problem domain, I can't say whether this is a practical solution.</p>

<p>Using this solution may mean a fair bit of refactoring of the code that calls these functions. Look through this code to see if editing it is prohibitively difficult or tedious.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><sup>1</sup>: Actually, it is <code>range([start], end, [step])</code>. I trust you get what I mean though.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The Pythonic way to do it is to choose readability, and therefor keep the 3 methods as they were at the beginning.</p>

<p>It's not like they are HUGE methods, or there are thousand of them, or you would have to dynamically generate them.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>No higher-order functions, but it's less code, even with the extraneous <code>else</code>.</p>

<pre><code>def exclusive(i, j, k):
    if j &lt;= k:
        return j &lt; i &lt; k
    else:
        return j &lt; i or i &lt; k

def inclusive_left(i, j, k):
    return i==j or exclusive(i, j, k)

def inclusive_right(i, j, k):
    return i==k or exclusive(i, j, k)
</code></pre>

<p>I actually tried switching the identifiers to <code>n, a, b</code>, but the code began to look less cohesive.  (My point: perfecting this code may not be a productive use of time.)</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Now I am thinking of something such as:</p>

<pre><code>def comparator(lop, rop):
    def comp(i, j, k):
        if j &lt;= k:
            return lop(j, i) and rop(i,k)
        return lop(j, i) or rop(i,k)

    return comp

from operator import le, lt

inRange = comparator(le, lt)
inStrictRange = comparator(lt, lt)
inRange2 = comparator(lt, le)
</code></pre>

<p>Which looks better indeed.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I certainly agree that you need only one function, and that the function should use a (Pythonic) half-open range.</p>

<p>Two suggestions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use meaningful names for the args:
in_range(x, lo, hi) is a big
improvement relative to the
2-keystroke cost.</p></li>
<li><p>Document the fact that the
constraint hi &lt; MAX means that it is
not possible to express a range that
includes <strong>all</strong> MAX elements. As
Wesley remarked, <em>size = (k - j) %
MAX</em> i.e. <em>size = (hi - lo) % MAX</em>
and thus <em>0 &lt;= size &lt; MAX</em>.</p></li>
</ol>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>To make it more familiar to your users, I would have one main in_range function with the same bounds as range(). This makes it much easier to remember, and has other nice properties as Wesley mentioned.</p>

<pre><code>def in_range(i, j, k):
    return (j &lt;= i &lt; k) if j &lt;= k else (j &lt;= i or i &lt; k)
</code></pre>

<p>You can certainly use this one alone for all your use cases by adding 1 to j and/or k. If you find that you're using a specific form frequently, then you can define it in terms of the main one:</p>

<pre><code>def exclusive(i, j, k):
    """Excludes both endpoints."""
    return in_range(i, j + 1, k)

def inclusive(i, j, k):
    """Includes both endpoints."""
    return in_range(i, j, k + 1)

def weird(i, j, k):
    """Excludes the left endpoint but includes the right endpoint."""
    return in_range(i, j + 1, k + 1)
</code></pre>

<p>This is shorter than mucking around with operators, and is also much less confusing to understand. Also, note that you should use underscores instead of camelCase for function names in Python.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I'd go one step further than Wesley in aping the normal python 'in range' idiom; i'd write a cyclic_range class:</p>

<pre><code>import itertools

MAX = 10 # or whatever

class cyclic_range(object):
	def __init__(self, start, stop):
		# mod so you can be a bit sloppy with indices, plus -1 means the last element, as with list indices
		self.start = start % MAX
		self.stop = stop % MAX
	def __len__(self):
		return (self.stop - self.start) % MAX
	def __getitem__(self, i):
		return (self.start + i) % MAX
	def __contains__(self, x):
		if (self.start &lt; self.stop):
			return (x &gt;= self.start) and (x &lt; self.stop)
		else:
			return (x &gt;= self.start) or (x &lt; self.stop)
	def __iter__(self):
		for i in xrange(len(self)):
			yield self[i]
	def __eq__(self, other):
		if (len(self) != len(other)): return False
		for a, b in itertools.izip(self, other):
			if (a != b): return False
		return True
	def __hash__(self):
		return (self.start &lt;&lt; 1) + self.stop
	def __str__(self):
		return str(list(self))
	def __repr__(self):
		return "cyclic_range(" + str(self.start) + ", " + str(self.stop) + ")"
	# and whatever other list-like methods you fancy
</code></pre>

<p>You can then write code like:</p>

<pre><code>if (myIndex in cyclic_range(firstNode, stopNode)):
	blah
</code></pre>

<p>To do the equivalent of inRange. To do inStrictRange, write:</p>

<pre><code>if (myIndex in cyclic_range(firstNode + 1, stopNode)):
</code></pre>

<p>And to do inRange2:</p>

<pre><code>if (myIndex in cyclic_range(firstNode + 1, stopNode + 1)):
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't like doing the additions by hand, how about adding these methods:</p>

<pre><code>	def strict(self):
		return cyclic_range(self.start + 1, self.stop)
	def right_closed(self):
		return cyclic_range(self.start + 1, self.stop + 1)
</code></pre>

<p>And then doing:</p>

<pre><code>if (myIndex in cyclic_range(firstNode, stopNode).strict()): # inStrictRange
if (myIndex in cyclic_range(firstNode, stopNode).closed_right()): # inRange2
</code></pre>

<p>Whilst this approach is, IMHO, more readable, it does involve doing an allocation, rather than just a function call, which is more expensive - although still O(1). But then if you really cared about performance, you wouldn't be using python!</p>
