<h3>Question (ID-552423):</h3><h2>Use Python 2.6 subprocess module in Python 2.5</h2><p>I would like to use Python 2.6's version of subprocess, because it allows the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen.terminate" rel="nofollow">Popen.terminate()</a> function, but I'm stuck with Python 2.5. Is there some reasonably clean way to use the newer version of the module in my 2.5 code? Some sort of <code>from __future__ import subprocess_module</code>?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I know this question has already been answered, but for what it's worth, I've used the <code>subprocess.py</code> that ships with Python 2.6 in Python 2.3 and it's worked fine. If you read the comments at the top of the file it says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code># This module should remain compatible with Python 2.2, see PEP 291.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>There isn't really a great way to do it. subprocess is <a href="http://svn.python.org/view/python/trunk/Lib/subprocess.py?rev=69620&amp;view=markup" rel="nofollow">implemented in python</a> (as opposed to C) so you could conceivably copy the module somewhere and use it (hoping of course that it doesn't use any 2.6 goodness).</p>

<p>On the other hand you could simply implement what subprocess claims to do and write a function that sends SIGTERM on *nix and calls TerminateProcess on Windows. The following implementation has been tested on linux and in a Win XP vm, you'll need the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/" rel="nofollow">python Windows extensions</a>:</p>

<pre><code>import sys

def terminate(process):
    """
    Kills a process, useful on 2.5 where subprocess.Popens don't have a 
    terminate method.


    Used here because we're stuck on 2.5 and don't have Popen.terminate 
    goodness.
    """

    def terminate_win(process):
        import win32process
        return win32process.TerminateProcess(process._handle, -1)

    def terminate_nix(process):
        import os
        import signal
        return os.kill(process.pid, signal.SIGTERM)

    terminate_default = terminate_nix

    handlers = {
        "win32": terminate_win, 
        "linux2": terminate_nix
    }

    return handlers.get(sys.platform, terminate_default)(process)
</code></pre>

<p>That way you only have to maintain the <code>terminate</code> code rather than the entire module.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>While this doesn't directly answer your question, it may be worth knowing.</p>

<p>Imports from <code>__future__</code> actually only change compiler options, so while it can turn with into a statement or make string literals produce unicodes instead of strs, it can't change the capabilities and features of modules in the Python standard library.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I followed Kamil Kisiel suggestion regarding using python 2.6 subprocess.py in python 2.5 and it worked perfectly. To make it easier, I created a distutils package that you can easy_install and/or include in buildout.</p>

<p>To use subprocess from python 2.6 in python 2.5 project:</p>

<pre><code>easy_install taras.python26
</code></pre>

<p>in your code</p>

<pre><code>from taras.python26 import subprocess
</code></pre>

<p>in buildout</p>

<pre><code>[buildout]
parts = subprocess26

[subprocess26]
recipe = zc.recipe.egg
eggs = taras.python26
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Here are some ways to end processes on Windows, taken directly from
<a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/347462/" rel="nofollow">http://code.activestate.com/recipes/347462/</a></p>

<pre><code># Create a process that won't end on its own
import subprocess
process = subprocess.Popen(['python.exe', '-c', 'while 1: pass'])


# Kill the process using pywin32
import win32api
win32api.TerminateProcess(int(process._handle), -1)


# Kill the process using ctypes
import ctypes
ctypes.windll.kernel32.TerminateProcess(int(process._handle), -1)


# Kill the proces using pywin32 and pid
import win32api
PROCESS_TERMINATE = 1
handle = win32api.OpenProcess(PROCESS_TERMINATE, False, process.pid)
win32api.TerminateProcess(handle, -1)
win32api.CloseHandle(handle)


# Kill the proces using ctypes and pid
import ctypes
PROCESS_TERMINATE = 1
handle = ctypes.windll.kernel32.OpenProcess(PROCESS_TERMINATE, False, process.pid)
ctypes.windll.kernel32.TerminateProcess(handle, -1)
ctypes.windll.kernel32.CloseHandle(handle)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Well Python is open source, you are free to take that pthread function from 2.6 and move it into your own code or use it as a reference to implement your own.</p>

<p>For reasons that should be obvious there's no way to have a hybrid of Python that can import portions of newer versions.</p>
