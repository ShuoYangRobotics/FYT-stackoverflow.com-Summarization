<h3>Question (ID-3167154):</h3><h2>How to split a dos path into its components in Python</h2><p>I have a string variable which represents a dos path e.g:</p>

<p><code>var = "d:\stuff\morestuff\furtherdown\THEFILE.txt"</code></p>

<p>I want to split this string into:</p>

<p><code>[ "d", "stuff", "morestuff", "furtherdown", "THEFILE.txt" ]</code></p>

<p>I have tried using <code>split()</code> and <code>replace()</code> but they either only process the first backslash or they insert hex numbers into the string.</p>

<p>I need to convert this string variable into a raw string somehow so that I can parse it.</p>

<p>What's the best way to do this?</p>

<p>I should also add that the contents of <code>var</code> i.e. the path that I'm trying to parse, is actually the return value of a command line query. It's not path data that I generate myself. Its stored in a file, and the command line tool is not going to escape the backslashes.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I've been bitten loads of times by people writing their own path fiddling functions and getting it wrong. Spaces, slashes, backslashes, colons -- the possibilities for confusion are not endless, but mistakes are easily made anyway. So I'm a stickler for the use of <code>os.path</code>, and recommend it on that basis.</p>

<p>(However, the path to virtue is not the one most easily taken, and many people when finding this are tempted to take a slippery path straight to damnation. They won't realise until one day everything falls to pieces, and they -- or, more likely, somebody else -- has to work out why everything has gone wrong, and it turns out somebody made a filename that mixes slashes and backslashes -- and some person suggests that the answer is "not to do that". Don't be any of these people. Except for the one who mixed up slashes and backslashes -- you could be them if you like.)</p>

<p>You can get the drive and path+file like this:</p>

<pre><code>drive,path_and_file=os.path.splitdrive(path)
</code></pre>

<p>Get the path and the file:</p>

<pre><code>path,file=os.path.split(path_and_file)
</code></pre>

<p>Getting the individual folder names is not especially convenient, but it is the sort of honest middling discomfort that heightens the pleasure of later finding something that actually works well:</p>

<pre><code>folders=[]
while 1:
    path,folder=os.path.split(path)

    if folder!="":
        folders.append(folder)
    else:
        if path!="":
            folders.append(path)

        break

folders.reverse()
</code></pre>

<p>(This pops a <code>"\"</code> at the start of <code>folders</code> if the path was originally absolute. You could lose a bit of code if you didn't want that.)</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The problem here starts with how you're creating the string in the first place.</p>

<pre><code>a = "d:\stuff\morestuff\furtherdown\THEFILE.txt"
</code></pre>

<p>Done this way, Python is trying to special case these: <code>\s</code>, <code>\m</code>, <code>\f</code>, and <code>\T'.  In your case,</code>\f` is being treated as a formfeed (0x0C) while the other backslashes are handled correctly.  What you need to do is one of these:</p>

<pre><code>b = "d:\\stuff\\morestuff\\furtherdown\\THEFILE.txt"      # doubled backslashes
c = r"d:\stuff\morestuff\furtherdown\THEFILE.txt"         # raw string, no doubling necessary
</code></pre>

<p>Then once you split either of these, you'll get the result you want.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>It works for me:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a=r"d:\stuff\morestuff\furtherdown\THEFILE.txt"
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.split("\\")
['d:', 'stuff', 'morestuff', 'furtherdown', 'THEFILE.txt']
</code></pre>

<p>Sure you might need to also strip out the colon from the first component, but keeping it makes it possible to re-assemble the path.</p>

<p>The <code>r</code> modifier marks the string literal as "raw"; notice how embedded backslashes are not doubled.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The stuff about about mypath.split("\") would be better expressed as mypath.split(os.pathsep).  pathsep is the path separator for your particular platform (e.g., \ for windows, / for unix, etc), and the python build knows which one to use.  If you use pathsep, then your code will be platform agnostic.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Let assume you have have a file <code>filedata.txt</code> with content:</p>

<pre><code>d:\stuff\morestuff\furtherdown\THEFILE.txt
d:\otherstuff\something\otherfile.txt
</code></pre>

<p>You can read and split the file paths:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in open("filedata.txt").readlines():
...     print i.strip().split("\\")
... 
['d:', 'stuff', 'morestuff', 'furtherdown', 'THEFILE.txt']
['d:', 'otherstuff', 'something', 'otherfile.txt']
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>use <code>ntpath.split()</code></p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Just like others explained - your problem stemmed from using <code>\</code>, which is escape character in string literal/constant. OTOH, if you had that file path string from another source (read from file, console or returned by os function) - there wouldn't have been problem splitting on '\\' or r'\'.</p>

<p>And just like others suggested, if you want to use <code>\</code> in program literal, you have to either duplicate it <code>\\</code> or the whole literal has to be prefixed by <code>r</code>, like so <code>r'lite\ral'</code> or <code>r"lite\ral"</code> to avoid the parser converting that <code>\</code> and <code>r</code> to CR (carriage return) character.</p>

<p>There is one more way though - just don't use backslash <code>\</code> pathnames in your code! Since last century Windows recognizes and works fine with pathnames which use forward slash as directory separator <code>/</code>! Somehow not many people know that.. but it works:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; var = "d:/stuff/morestuff/furtherdown/THEFILE.txt"
&gt;&gt;&gt; var.split('/')
['d:', 'stuff', 'morestuff', 'furtherdown', 'THEFILE.txt']
</code></pre>

<p>This by the way will make your code work on Unix, Windows and Mac... because all of them do use <code>/</code> as directory separator... even if you don't want to use the predefined constants of module <code>os</code>.</p>
