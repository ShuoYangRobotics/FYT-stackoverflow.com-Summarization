<h3>Question (ID-625083):</h3><h2>Python __init__ and self what do they do?</h2><p>I'm learning the Python programming language, and I've come across certain things I don't fully understand.  I'm coming from a C background, but I never went far with that either.</p>

<p>What I'm trying to figure out is:</p>

<p>In a method:</p>

<pre><code>def method(self, blah):
    def __init__(?):
        ....
    ....
</code></pre>

<p>What does self do? what is it meant to be? and is it mandatory?</p>

<p>What does the <code>__init__</code> method do? why is it necessary? etc</p>

<p>I think they might be oop constructs, but I don't know very much..</p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-9):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>In this code:</p>

<pre><code>class A(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.x = 'Hello'

    def method_a(self, foo):
        print self.x + ' ' + foo
</code></pre>

<p>... the <code>self</code> variable represents the instance of the object itself.  Most object-oriented languages pass this as a hidden parameter to the methods defined on an object; Python does not.  You have to declare it explicitly.  When you create an instance of the <code>A</code> class and call its methods, it will be passed automatically, as in ...</p>

<pre><code>a = A()               # We do not pass any argument to the __init__ method
a.method_a('Sailor!') # We only pass a single argument
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>__init__</code> method is roughly what represents a constructor in Python.  When you call <code>A()</code> Python creates an object for you, and passes it as the first parameter to the <code>__init__</code> method.  Any additional parameters (e.g., <code>A(24, 'Hello')</code>) will also get passed as arguments--in this case causing an exception to be raised, since the constructor isn't expecting them.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>They are OOP constructs. If you are a beginner in OOP, it's going to be hard to explain them in a few sentences.</p>

<p>Here's a tutorial that introduces OOP in Python. It also provides some answers to your questions:</p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Yep, you are right, these are oop constructs.</p>

<p>init is the constructor for a class.  The self parameter refers to the instance of the object (like <strong>this</strong> in C++).</p>

<pre><code>class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self._x = x
        self._y = y
</code></pre>

<p>The init method gets called when memory for the object is allocated:</p>

<pre><code>x = Point(1,2)
</code></pre>

<p>It is important to use the self parameter inside an object's method if you want to persist the value with the object.  If, for instance, you implement the init method like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        _x = x
        _y = y
</code></pre>

<p>Your x and y parameters would be stored in variables on the stack and would be discarded when the init method goes out of scope.  Setting those variables as self._x sets those variables as members of the Point object (accessible for the lifetime of the object).</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>In short:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>self</code> as it suggests, refers to <em>itself</em>- the object which has called the method. That is, if you have N objects calling the method, then <code>self.a</code> will refer to a separate instance of the variable for each of the N objects. Imagine N copies of the variable <code>a</code> for each object</li>
<li><code>__init__</code> is what is called as a constructor in other OOP languages such as C++/Java. The basic idea is that it is a <em>special</em> method which is automatically called when an object of that Class is created</li>
</ol>

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p><code>__init__</code> does act like a constructor. You'll need to pass "self" to any class functions as the first argument if you want them to behave as non-static methods. "self" are instance variables for your class.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>The 'self' is a reference to the class instance</p>

<pre><code>class foo:
    def bar(self):
            print "hi"
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can create an instance of foo and call the method on it, the self parameter is added by Python in this case:</p>

<pre><code>f = foo()
f.bar()
</code></pre>

<p>But it can be passed in as well if the method call isn't in the context of an instance of the class, the code below does the same thing</p>

<pre><code>f = foo()
foo.bar(f)
</code></pre>

<p>Interestingly the variable name 'self' is just a convention. The below definition will work exactly the same.. Having said that it is <strong>very strong convention</strong> which should be followed <strong>always</strong>, but it does say something about flexible nature of the language</p>

<pre><code>class foo:
    def bar(s):
            print "hi"
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>You would be correct, they are object-oriented constructs. Basically <code>self</code> is a reference (kind of like a pointer, but <code>self</code> is a special reference which you can't assign to) to an object, and <code>__init__</code> is a function which is called to initialize the object - that is, set the values of variables etc. - just after memory is allocated for it.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>This may help: <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/s_lott/books/nonprog/htmlchunks/ch42.html" rel="nofollow">http://homepage.mac.com/s_lott/books/nonprog/htmlchunks/ch42.html</a></p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>note that <code>self</code> could actually be any valid python identifier.  For example, we could just as easily write, from Chris B's example:</p>

<pre><code>class A(object):
    def __init__(foo):
        foo.x = 'Hello'

    def method_a(bar, foo):
        print bar.x + ' ' + foo
</code></pre>

<p>and it would work exactly the same.  It is however recommended to use self because other pythoners will recognize it more easily.</p>
