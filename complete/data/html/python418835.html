<h3>Question (ID-418835):</h3><h2>Are there any graph/plotting/anything-like-that libraries for Python 3.0?</h2><p>As per the title. I am trying to create a simple scater plot, but haven't found any Python 3.0 libraries that can do it. Note, this isn't for a website, so the web ones are a bit useless.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Maybe you can use Python Imaging Library (PIL).
Also have a look at PyX, but this library is meant to output to PDF, ...</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The GChartWrapper (<a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/GChartWrapper/0.7" rel="nofollow">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/GChartWrapper/0.7</a>) does work for py3k</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I'm sure I'll get modded down for this but, why do you need to use python 3 to make a graph?</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Have you looked at the Google Chart Wrapper?</p>

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I would call <a href="http://gnuplot-py.sourceforge.net" rel="nofollow">Gnuplot</a> from Python. No need to reinvent the wheel in Python, Gnuplot is already there and already has a Python interface.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>The current <a href="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib" rel="nofollow">development version of matplotlib</a> should work on Python 3.</p>
