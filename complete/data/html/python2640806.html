<h3>Question (ID-2640806):</h3><h2>JavaScript-like Object in Python standard library?</h2><p>Quite often, I find myself wanting a simple, "dump" object in Python which behaves like a JavaScript object (ie, its members can be accessed either with <code>.member</code> or with <code>['member']</code>).</p>

<p>Usually I'll just stick this at the top of the <code>.py</code>:</p>

<pre><code>class DumbObject(dict):
    def __getattr__(self, attr):
        return self[attr]
    def __stattr__(self, attr, value):
        self[attr] = value
</code></pre>

<p>But that's kind of lame, and there is at least one bug with that implementation (although I can't remember what it is).</p>

<p>So, is there something similar in the standard library?</p>

<p>And, for the record, simply instanciating <code>object</code> doesn't work:</p>

<pre>
>>> obj = object()
>>> obj.airspeed = 42
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "", line 1, in 
AttributeError: 'object' object has no attribute 'airspeed'
</pre>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: (dang, should have seen this one coming)â€¦ Don't worry! I'm not trying to write JavaScript in Python. The place I most often find I want this is while I'm still experimenting: I have a collection of "stuff" that doesn't quite feel right to put in a dictionary, but also doesn't feel right to have its own class.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>There is no "standard library" with that kind of object, but on ActiveState there is a quite well-known recipe from Alex Martelli, called <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/52308-the-simple-but-handy-collector-of-a-bunch-of-named/" rel="nofollow">"bunch"</a>.</p>

<p>Note: there's also a package available on pypi called <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bunch/1.0.0" rel="nofollow">bunch</a> and that should do about the same thing, but I do not know anything about its implementation and quality.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You can try with <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/361668/" rel="nofollow">attrdict</a>:</p>

<pre><code>class attrdict(dict):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        dict.__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)
        self.__dict__ = self

a = attrdict(x=1, y=2)
print a.x, a.y
print a['x'], a['y']

b = attrdict()
b.x, b.y  = 1, 2
print b.x, b.y
print b['x'], b['y']
</code></pre>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I'm not a big fan of that, because you get into the "what if you define 'keys'":</p>

<pre><code>foo = DumbObject()
foo.moshe = 'here'
foo.keys # --&gt; gives a callable, if you'll call it you'll get ['moshe']
foo.keys = 'front-door'
foo.keys # --&gt; oh look, now it's a string 'front-door'
</code></pre>

<p>Is "keys" supposed to be a defined method on your object, or is that just happenstance? If it is, then you better define DumbObject as</p>

<pre><code>class DumbObject(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self._dict = {}
    def __getitem__(self, key):
        return self._dict[key]
    __getattr__ = __getitem__
    # Ditto for set
def asDictionary(do):
    return do._dict
</code></pre>

<p>But why are you doing it? Are you sure that this is the right answer? Perhaps you should be using the right type of object?</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>If I understand you correctly, you want an object where you can just dump attributes. If I am correct, all you would have to do is create an empty class. For example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class DumpObject: pass
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt;#example of usage:
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = DumpObject()
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.airspeed = 420
&gt;&gt;&gt; print a.airspeed
420
</code></pre>

<p>That's it</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You seem to be wanting to write JavaScript in Python, and that is as bad as writing Python in JavaScript, and nearly as bad as writing COBOL in Java.</p>

<p>That being said, it really depends on what you are trying to achieve. If what you want is to create an object from an iterable, you might be interested on the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/collections.html#namedtuple-factory-function-for-tuples-with-named-fields" rel="nofollow">Named</a> <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/500261-named-tuples/" rel="nofollow">Tuple</a> class.</p>

<p>Else, if you really need this functionality, you can use <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2640806/javascript-like-object-in-python-standard-library/2640855#2640855">moshez' <code>DumbObject</code></a>, but as he said, you might be approaching this in a less than optimum way.</p>
