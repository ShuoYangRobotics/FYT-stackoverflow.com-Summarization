<h3>Question (ID-463604):</h3><h2>What is the preferred way to type-check variables in Python?</h2><p>I have a Python function that takes a numeric argument that <strong>must</strong> be an integer in order for it behave correctly. What is the preferred way of verifying this in Python?</p>

<p>My first reaction is to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>def isInteger(n):
    return int(n) == n
</code></pre>

<p>But I can't help thinking that this is 1) expensive 2) ugly and 3) subject to the tender mercies of machine epsilon. </p>

<p>Does Python provide any native means of type checking variables? Or is this considered to be a violation of the language's dynamically typed design?</p>

<p>EDIT: since a number of people have asked - the application in question works with IPv4 prefixes, sourcing data from flat text files. If any input is parsed into a float, that record should be viewed as malformed and ignored.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>If you need to know whether it's definitely an actual int and not a subclass of int (generally you shouldn't need to do this):</p>

<pre><code>type(n) is int
</code></pre>

<p>this:</p>

<pre><code>return int(n) == n
</code></pre>

<p>isn't such a good idea, as cross-type comparisons can be true - notably <code>int(3.0)==3.0</code></p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Yeah, as Evan said, don't type check. Just try to use the value:</p>

<pre><code>def myintfunction(value):
   """ Please pass an integer """
   return 2 + value
</code></pre>

<p>That doesn't have a typecheck. It is much better! Let's see what happens when I try it:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; myintfunction(5)
7
</code></pre>

<p>That works, because it is an integer. Hm. Lets try some text.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; myintfunction('text')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 3, in myintfunction
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
</code></pre>

<p>It shows an error, TypeError, which is what it should do anyway. If caller wants to catch that, it is possible.  </p>

<p>What would you do if you did a typecheck? Show an error right? So you don't have to typecheck because the error is already showing up automatically.</p>

<p>Plus since you didn't typecheck, you have your function working with other types:</p>

<p>Floats:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print myintfunction(2.2)
4.2
</code></pre>

<p>Complex numbers:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print myintfunction(5j)
(2+5j)
</code></pre>

<p>Decimals:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import decimal
&gt;&gt;&gt; myintfunction(decimal.Decimal('15'))
Decimal("17")
</code></pre>

<p>Even completely arbitrary objects that can add numbers!</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class MyAdderClass(object):
...     def __radd__(self, value):
...             print 'got some value: ', value
...             return 25
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; m = MyAdderClass()
&gt;&gt;&gt; print myintfunction(m)
got some value:  2
25
</code></pre>

<p>So you clearly get nothing by typechecking. And lose a lot.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<h1>UPDATE:</h1>

<p>Since you've edited the question, it is now clear that your application calls some upstream routine that makes sense only with ints. </p>

<p>That being the case, I still think you should pass the parameter <strong>as received</strong> to the upstream function. The upstream function will deal with it correctly e.g. raising an error if it needs to. I highly <strong>doubt it</strong> your function that deals with IPs will behave strangely if you pass it a float. If you can give us the name of the library we can check that for you.</p>

<p>But... If the upstream function will behave incorrectly and kill some kids if you pass it a float (I still highly doubt it), then just just call <code>int()</code> on it:</p>

<pre><code>def myintfunction(value):
   """ Please pass an integer """
   return upstreamfunction(int(value))
</code></pre>

<p>You're still not typechecking, so you get most benefits of not typechecking.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>If even after all that, you really want to type check, despite it reducing your application's readability and performance for absolutely no benefit, use an <code>assert</code> to do it.</p>

<pre><code>assert isinstance(...)
assert type() is xxxx
</code></pre>

<p>That way we can turn off <code>assert</code>s and remove this <code>&lt;sarcasm&gt;</code><em>feature</em><code>&lt;/sarcasm&gt;</code> from the program by calling it as</p>

<pre><code>python -OO program.py
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Don't type check. The whole point of duck typing is that you shouldn't have to. For instance, what if someone did something like this:</p>

<pre><code>class MyInt(int):
    # ... extra stuff ...
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Programming in Python and performing typechecking as you might in other languages does seem like choosing a screwdriver to bang a nail in with. It is more elegant to use Python's exception handling features.</p>

<p>From an interactive command line, you can run a statement like:</p>

<pre><code>int('sometext')
</code></pre>

<p>That will generate an error - ipython tells me:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;type 'exceptions.ValueError'&gt;: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'sometext'
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can write some code like:</p>

<pre><code>try:
   int(myvar) + 50
except ValueError:
   print "Not a number"
</code></pre>

<p>That can be customised to perform whatever operations are required AND to catch any errors that are expected. It looks a bit convoluted but fits the syntax and idioms of Python and results in very readable code (once you become used to speaking Python).</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><pre><code>if type(n) is int
</code></pre>

<p>This checks if <code>n</code> is a Python int, and <em>only</em> an int. It won't accept subclasses of <code>int</code>.</p>

<p>Type-checking, however, does not fit the "Python way". You better use <code>n</code> as an int, and if it throws an exception, catch it and act upon it.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I would be tempted to to something like:</p>

<pre><code>def check_and_convert(x):
    x = int(x)
    assert 0 &lt;= x &lt;= 255, "must be between 0 and 255 (inclusive)"
    return x

class IPv4(object):
    """IPv4 CIDR prefixes is A.B.C.D/E where A-D are 
       integers in the range 0-255, and E is an int 
       in the range 0-32."""

    def __init__(self, a, b, c, d, e=0):
        self.a = check_and_convert(a)
        self.b = check_and_convert(a)
        self.c = check_and_convert(a)
        self.d = check_and_convert(a)
        assert 0 &lt;= x &lt;= 32, "must be between 0 and 32 (inclusive)"
        self.e = int(e)
</code></pre>

<p>That way when you are using it anything can be passed in yet you only store a valid integer. </p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>how about:</p>

<pre><code>def ip(string):
    subs = string.split('.')
    if len(subs) != 4:
        raise ValueError("incorrect input")
    out = tuple(int(v) for v in subs if 0 &lt;= int(v) &lt;= 255)
    if len(out) != 4:
        raise ValueError("incorrect input")
    return out
</code></pre>

<p>ofcourse there is the standard isinstance(3, int) function ...</p>
