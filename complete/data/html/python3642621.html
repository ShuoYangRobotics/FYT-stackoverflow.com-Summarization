<h3>Question (ID-3642621):</h3><h2>Take first successful match from a batch of regexes</h2><p>I'm trying to extract set of data from a string that can match one of three patterns. I have a list of compiled regexes. I want to run through them (in order) and go with the first match.</p>

<pre><code>regexes = [
    compiled_regex_1,
    compiled_regex_2,
    compiled_regex_3,
]

m = None
for reg in regexes:
    m = reg.match(name)
    if m: break

if not m:
    print 'ARGL NOTHING MATCHES THIS!!!'
</code></pre>

<p>This should work (haven't tested yet) but it's pretty fugly. Is there a better way of boiling down a loop that breaks when it succeeds or explodes when it doesn't?</p>

<p>There might be something specific to <code>re</code> that I don't know about that allows you to test multiple patterns too.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You can use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/compound_stmts.html#for" rel="nofollow">else</a> clause of the <code>for</code> loop:</p>

<pre><code>for reg in regexes:
    m = reg.match(name)
    if m: break
else:
    print 'ARGL NOTHING MATCHES THIS!!!'
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>If you just want to know if any of the regex match then you could use the builtin <code>any</code> function:</p>

<pre><code>if any(reg.match(name) for reg in regexes):
     ....
</code></pre>

<p>however this will not tell you which regex matched.</p>

<p>Alternatively you can combine multiple patterns into a single regex with <code>|</code>:</p>

<pre><code>regex = re.compile(r"(regex1)|(regex2)|...")
</code></pre>

<p>Again this will not tell you which regex matched, but you will have a match object that you can use for further information.  For example you can find out which of the regex succeeded from the group that is not None:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; match = re.match("(a)|(b)|(c)|(d)", "c")
&gt;&gt;&gt; match.groups()
(None, None, 'c', None)
</code></pre>

<p>However this can get complicated however if any of the sub-regex have groups in them as well, since the numbering will be changed.</p>

<p>This is probably faster than matching each regex individually since the regex engine has more scope for optimising the regex.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Since you have a finite set in this case, you could use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-circuit_evaluation" rel="nofollow">short ciruit evaluation</a>:</p>

<pre><code>m = compiled_regex_1.match(name) or
    compiled_regex_2.match(name) or
    compiled_regex_3.match(name) or
    print("ARGHHHH!")
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>In Python 2.6 or better:</p>

<pre><code>import itertools as it

m = next(it.ifilter(None, (r.match(name) for r in regexes)), None)
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>ifilter</code> call could be made into a genexp, but only a bit awkwardly, i.e., with the usual trick for name binding in a genexp (aka the "phantom nested <code>for</code> clause idiom"):</p>

<pre><code>m = next((m for r in regexes for m in (r.match(name),) if m), None)
</code></pre>

<p>but <code>itertools</code> is generally preferable where applicable.</p>

<p>The bit needing <code>2.6</code> is the <code>next</code> built-in, which lets you specify a default value if the iterator is exhausted.  If you have to simulate it in 2.5 or earlier,</p>

<pre><code>def next(itr, deft):
  try: return itr.next()
  except StopIteration: return deft
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I use something like Dave Kirby suggested, but add named groups to the regexps, so that I know which one matched.</p>

<pre><code>regexps = {
  'first': r'...',
  'second': r'...',
}

compiled = re.compile('|'.join('(?P&lt;%s&gt;%s)' % item for item in regexps.iteritems()))
match = compiled.match(my_string)
print match.lastgroup
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Eric is in better track in taking bigger picture of what OP is aiming, I would use if else though. I would also think that using print function in <code>or</code> expression is little questionable. +1 for Nathon of correcting OP to use proper else statement.</p>

<p>Then my alternative:</p>

<pre><code># alternative to any builtin that returns useful result,
# the first considered True value
def first(seq):
    for item in seq:
        if item: return item

regexes = [
    compiled_regex_1,
    compiled_regex_2,
    compiled_regex_3,
]

m = first(reg.match(name) for reg in regexes)
print(m if m else 'ARGL NOTHING MATCHES THIS!!!')
</code></pre>
