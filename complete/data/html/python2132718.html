<h3>Question (ID-2132718):</h3><h2>Best way to handle list.index(might-not-exist) in python?</h2><p>I have code which looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>thing_index = thing_list.index(thing)
otherfunction(thing_list, thing_index)
</code></pre>

<p>ok so that's simplified but you get the idea. Now <code>thing</code> might not actually be in the list, in which case I want to pass -1 as <code>thing_index</code>. In other languages this is what you'd expect <code>index()</code> to return if it couldn't find the element. In fact it throws a <code>ValueError</code>.</p>

<p>I could do this:</p>

<pre><code>try:
    thing_index = thing_list.index(thing)
except ValueError:
    thing_index = -1
otherfunction(thing_list, thing_index)
</code></pre>

<p>But this feels dirty, plus I don't know if <code>ValueError</code> could be raised for some other reason. I came up with the following solution based on generator functions, but it seems a little complex:</p>

<pre><code>thing_index = ( [(i for i in xrange(len(thing_list)) if thing_list[i]==thing)] or [-1] )[0]
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a cleaner way to achieve the same thing? Let's assume the list isn't sorted.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>There is nothing "dirty" about using try-except clause. This is the pythonic way. <code>ValueError</code> will be raised by the <code>.index</code> method only, because it's the only code you have there!</p>

<p>To answer the comment:<br>
In Python, <a href="http://docs.python.org/3.1/glossary.html#term-eafp" rel="nofollow"><em>easier to ask forgiveness than to get permission</em></a> philosophy is well established, and <strong>no</strong> <code>index</code> will not raise this type of error for any other issues. Not that I can think of any. </p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#dict" rel="nofollow"><CODE>dict</CODE> type</a> has a <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#dict.get" rel="nofollow"><CODE>get</CODE> function</a>, where if the key doesn't exist in the dictionary, the 2nd argument to <code>get</code> is the value that it should return.  Similarly there is <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#dict.setdefault" rel="nofollow"><CODE>setdefault</CODE></a>, which returns the value in the <code>dict</code> if the key exists, otherwise it sets the value according to your default parameter and then returns your default parameter.</p>

<p>You could extend the <code>list</code> type to have a <code>getindexdefault</code> method.</p>

<pre><code>object SuperDuperList(list):
    def getindexdefault(self, elem, default):
        try:
            thing_index = self.index(elem)
        catch ValueError:
            return default
</code></pre>

<p>Which could then be used like:</p>

<pre><code>mylist = SuperDuperList([0,1,2])
index = mylist.getindexdefault( 'asdf', -1 )
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>There is nothing wrong with your code that uses <code>ValueError</code>. Here's yet another one-liner if you'd like to avoid exceptions:</p>

<pre><code>thing_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(thing_list) if x == thing), -1)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>This issue is one of language philosophy. In Java for example there has always been a tradition that exceptions should really only be used in "exceptional circumstances" that is when errors have happened, rather than for <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DontUseExceptionsForFlowControl" rel="nofollow">flow control</a>. In the beginning this was for performance reasons as Java exceptions were slow but now this has become the accepted style.</p>

<p>In contrast Python has always used exceptions to indicate normal program flow, like raising a <code>ValueError</code> as we are discussing here. There is nothing "dirty" about this in Python style and there are many more where that came from. An even more common example is <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/exceptions.html#exceptions.StopIteration" rel="nofollow"><code>StopIteration</code> exception</a> which is raised by an iteratorâ€˜s <code>next()</code> method to signal that there are no further values.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>What about this:</p>

<pre><code>otherfunction(thing_collection, thing)
</code></pre>

<p>Rather than expose something so implementation-dependent like a list index in a function interface, pass the collection and the thing and let otherfunction deal with the "test for membership" issues.  If otherfunction is written to be collection-type-agnostic, then it would probably start with:</p>

<pre><code>if thing in thing_collection:
    ... proceed with operation on thing
</code></pre>

<p>which will work if thing_collection is a list, tuple, set, or dict.</p>

<p>This is possibly clearer than:</p>

<pre><code>if thing_index != MAGIC_VALUE_INDICATING_NOT_A_MEMBER:
</code></pre>

<p>which is the code you already have in otherfunction.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I don't know why you should think it is dirty... because of the exception? if you want a oneliner, here it is:</p>

<pre><code>thing_index = thing_list.index(elem) if thing_list.count(elem) else -1
</code></pre>

<p>but i would advise against using it; I think Ross Rogers solution is the best, use an object to encapsulate your desiderd behaviour, don't try pushing the language to its limits at the cost of readability.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><pre><code>thing_index = thing_list.index(elem) if elem in thing_list else -1
</code></pre>

<p>One line. Simple. No exceptions.</p>
