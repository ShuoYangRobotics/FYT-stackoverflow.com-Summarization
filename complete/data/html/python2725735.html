<h3>Question (ID-2725735):</h3><h2>Recommendations for a simple 2D graphics python library that can output to screen and pdf?</h2><p>I'm looking for an easy-to-use graphics lib for python that can output to screen as well as pdf. So, I would use code to draw some stuff (simple prims like ovals, rectangles, lines and points) to screen and then when things look good, have it output to pdf.</p>

<p>Make sense?</p>

<p>Thanks!

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>If you use Tkinter, you can draw on a Canvas widget, then use its <code>.postscript</code> method to save the contents as a PostScript file, which you can convert to PDF using <code>ps2pdf</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>postscript(self, cnf={}, **kw)
  Print the contents of the canvas to a postscript
  file. Valid options: colormap, colormode, file, fontmap,
  height, pageanchor, pageheight, pagewidth, pagex, pagey,
  rotate, witdh, x, y.</p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You can use the <a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/" rel="nofollow">Python Imaging Library</a> for drawing images which can easily be displayed in various UIs, e.g. by displaying a jpg.  Then, use <a href="http://www.reportlab.com/" rel="nofollow">ReportLab</a>.  Here's an <a href="http://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2010/03/08/a-simple-step-by-step-reportlab-tutorial/" rel="nofollow">example</a> which shows how to use ReportLab with an image.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what you mean by drawing to "screen", i.e. if you're working with a specific UI toolkit.  But if it's acceptable to draw and display PDFs without using an intermediate image (jpg, etc), then you might consider the <a href="http://pyx.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">PyX</a> library, which makes it quite simple to do graphics with PDFs.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You could look into <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">matplotlib</a>, which is mainly for plotting but you could probably do some basic drawing.</p>

<p>Then there is <a href="http://www.pygame.org/news.html" rel="nofollow">pygame</a>.  But I'm not so sure if it can generate a pdf, however you can do 2D graphics with it.</p>

<p>There is something called <a href="http://www.reportlab.com/software/opensource/" rel="nofollow">ReportLab</a> that can generate pdf's.  <a href="http://tutorial-index.com/redirect/16344" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is a bunch of tutorials using it. </p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>This is a tricky question, because there are <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/NumericAndScientific/Plotting" rel="nofollow">so many libraries available</a> - there is a trade-off between beauty/easiness.</p>

<p>What I've done and works great is to produce the Postscript directly, it is not difficult at all, and you can preview it using Ghostview; converting tyo PDF is trivial (<code>ps2pdf</code>). Learning how to tell Postscript to create lines and circles is extremely simple.</p>

<p>If you want more extensibility, then go to Matplotlib, but beware of the many times when it will "decide for you what looks best" even if you don't like it.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Creating PDFs is always a pain, it doesn't make sense if you do not aim to lose sanity.</p>

<p>With that said, you are aiming to do two completely different things: when you draw to screen you draw into a raster bitmap, while PDFs are mostly dynamic, like HTML. <em>(unlike HTML they are more prone to be the same over different platforms, but that's beside the point)</em></p>

<p>If you really want to do that, the solution might be finding something that outputs PDFs, and <em>then</em> showing the generated PDF on screen at every step.
I guess that's the only way to have WYSIWYG results.</p>
