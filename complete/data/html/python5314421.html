<h3>Question (ID-5314421):</h3><h2>Naming variable, best convention</h2><p>What is the most used convention for naming variables in Python / Django?
ex: pub_date or pubdate</p>

<p>What about for classes and methods?</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow">PEP 8</a>, nothing more to say.</p>

<p>Of course you can use your own style (I use camelCase, for example), but most people use recommendations from that PEP.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Code Complete (http://www.cc2e.com/) has some great chapters about function/variable naming, not for Python explicitly, but perhaps still interesting...</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I use <code>lower_case_with_underscore</code> for variables, methods and functions. I think it really improves readability of the code.</p>

<p>For classes, I tend to use upper case the first letter: <code>class NewsForm (forms.Form):</code></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>The important thing is being consistent with your naming style. Choose one with your project mates and use it. Don't mix them. I personally use camelCase:</p>

<p>Sample class name: MyClass (capital letter at the beginning)</p>

<p>Sample method name: myMethod</p>

<p>Sample variable name: myVariable</p>

<p>Sample constant/enum name: MY_CONST</p>

<p>Class name should start with capital letter to make clear what it is in your code. Same about constants/enums. Values that don't change throughout your program should consist of capital letters. </p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>In addition to the correct references to PEP-8 and Django, let me add Google's Python style guide, which features a naming convention. It is <a href="http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html#Naming" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
