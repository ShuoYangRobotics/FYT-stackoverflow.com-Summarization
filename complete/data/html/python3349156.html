<h3>Question (ID-3349156):</h3><h2>General utility to remove/strip all comments from source code in various languages?</h2><p>I am looking for a command-line tool that removes all comments from an input
file and returns the stripped output. It'd be nice it supports popular
programming languages like c, c++, python, php, javascript, html, css, etc.  It
has to be syntax-aware as opposed to regexp-based, since the latter will catch
the pattern in source code strings as well. Is there any such tool?</p>

<p>I am fully aware that comments are useful information and often leaving them
as they are is a good idea. It's just that my focus is on different use cases.</p>

  <h3>Remove Comments from Source Code</h3>
  
  <p>How can you tell if cloc correctly identifies comments? One way to convince yourself cloc is doing the right thing is to use its <code>--strip-comments</code> option to remove comments and blank lines from files, then compare the stripped-down files to originals. </p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>What you want can be done with emacs scripting.</p>

<p>I wrote this script for you which does exactly what you want and can be easily extended to any language.</p>

<p><strong>Filename: kill-comments</strong></p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python                                                         

import subprocess                                                         
import sys                                                                
import os                                                                 

target_file = sys.argv[1]                                                 

command =   "emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs-batch " + \                         
    target_file + \                                                       
    " --eval '(kill-comment (count-lines (point-min) (point-max)))'" + \  
    " -f save-buffer"                                                     

#to load a custom .emacs script (for more syntax support),                
#use -l &lt;file&gt; in the above command                                       

#print command                                                            

fnull = open(os.devnull, 'w')                                             
subprocess.call(command, shell = True, stdout = fnull, stderr = fnull)    
fnull.close()
</code></pre>

<p>to use it just call:</p>

<pre><code>kill-comments &lt;file-name&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>To add any language to it edit ~/.emacs-batch and add that language's major mode.
You can find syntax aware modes for basically everything you could want at <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.emacswiki.org</a>.</p>

<p>As an example, here is my ~/.emacs-batch file.  It extends the above script to remove comments from javascript files. (I have <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/JavaScriptMode" rel="nofollow">javascript.el</a> in my ~/.el directory)</p>

<pre><code>(setq load-path (append (list (concat (getenv "HOME") "/.el")) load-path))    
(load "javascript")                                               
(setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.js$" . javascript-mode) auto-mode-alist))
</code></pre>

<p>With the javascript addition this will remove comments from all the filetypes you mentioned as well as many more.</p>

<p>Good Luck and happy coding!</p>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I don't know of such a tool - which isn't the same as saying there isn't one.</p>

<p>I once started to design one, but it quickly gets insane - not helped by the comment rules in C and C++.</p>

<pre><code>/\
*  Comment? *\
/
</code></pre>

<p>(Answer: yes!)</p>

<pre><code>"/\
* Comment? *\
/"
</code></pre>

<p>(Answer: no!)</p>

<p>To do the job reasonably, you have to be aware of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Language comment conventions</li>
<li>Language quoted string conventions (Python and Perl are enough to drive you insane here)</li>
<li>Escape conventions (Shell gets you here - along with the quotes)</li>
</ul>

<p>These combine to make the job tolerably close to impossible.</p>

<p>I ended up with a program, <em>scc</em>, to strip C and C++ comments.  Its torture test includes worse examples than the comments shown above - and it does a decent job.  But extending that to do shell or Perl or Python or (take your pick) was sufficiently non-trivial that I did not do it.</p>
