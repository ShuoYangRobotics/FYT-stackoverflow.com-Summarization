<h3>Question (ID-2919865):</h3><h2>related to list and file handling?</h2><p>I have file with contents in list form such as</p>

<pre><code>[1,'ab','fgf','ssd']
[2,'eb','ghf','hhsd']
[3,'ag','rtf','ssfdd']
</code></pre>

<p>I want to read that file line by line using <code>f.readline</code> and assign each line to a list.</p>

<p>I tried doing this:</p>

<pre><code>k=[ ]
k=f.readline()
print k[1] 
</code></pre>

<p>I expected a result to show 2nd element in the list in first line, but it showed the first bit and gave o/p as <code>'1'</code>.</p>

<p>How to get the expected output?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>If all you want is to take the input format shown and store it as a list attempting to execute the input file (with <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#eval" rel="nofollow">eval()</a>) is not a good idea. This leaves your program open to all sorts of accidentally and intentionally harmful input. You are better advised to just parse the input file:</p>

<pre><code>s=f.readline()[1:-1]
k = s.split(',')
print k[1]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>readline just returns strings. You need to cast it to what you want. <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#eval" rel="nofollow"><code>eval</code></a> does the job, be warned that however it does <strong>execute everything</strong> inside the string, so this is only an option if you trust the input (i.e. you've saved it yourself).</p>

<p>If you need to save data from your program to a file, you might want to use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/pickle.html" rel="nofollow">pickle</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>if the sample posted is actual content of your file (which I highly doubt), here is what you could do starting with Python 2.6, <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/ast.html#ast.literal_eval" rel="nofollow">docs</a>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; for line in open(fname):
    print(ast.literal_eval(line)[1])


ab
eb
ag
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You could use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#eval" rel="nofollow"><code>eval</code></a> on each line; this would evaluate the the expression in the line and should yield your expected list, if the formatting is correct.</p>

<p>A safer solution would be a simple CSV parser. For that your input could look something like this (comma-separated):</p>

<pre><code>123,321,12,123,321,'asd',ewr,'afdg','et al',213
</code></pre>

<p>Maybe this is feasible.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Maybe You can use eval as suggested, but I'm just curious: Is there any reason not to use <code>JSON</code> as file format?</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You can use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/json.html" rel="nofollow">json</a> module:</p>

<pre><code>import json

with open('lists.txt', 'r') as f:
  lines = f.readlines()
  for line in lines:
    line = line.replace("'", '"')
    l = json.loads(line)
    print l[1]
</code></pre>

<p>Outputs:</p>

<pre><code>ab
eb
ag
</code></pre>
