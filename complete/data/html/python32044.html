<h3>Question (ID-32044):</h3><h2>How can I render a tree structure (recursive) using a django template?</h2><p>I have a tree structure in memory that I would like to render in HTML using a Django template. </p>

<pre><code>class Node():
  name = "node name"
  children = []
</code></pre>

<p>There will be some object <code>root</code> that is a <code>Node</code>, and <code>children</code> is a list of <code>Node</code>s. <code>root</code> will be passed in the content of the template.</p>

<p>I have found <a href="http://blog.elsdoerfer.name/2008/01/22/recursion-in-django-templates/" rel="nofollow">this</a> one discussion of how this might be achieved, but the poster suggests this might not be good in a production environment.</p>

<p>Does anybody know of a better way?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>this might be way more than you need, but there is a django module called 'mptt' - this stores a hierarchical tree structure in an sql database, and includes templates for display in the view code.  you might be able to find something useful there.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I think the canonical answer is: "Don't".</p>

<p>What you should probably do instead is unravel the thing in your <em>view</em> code, so it's just a matter of iterating over (in|de)dents in the template. I think I'd do it by appending indents and dedents to a list while recursing through the tree and then sending that "travelogue" list to the template. (the template would then insert <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/li&gt;</code> from that list, creating the recursive structure with "understanding" it.)</p>

<p>I'm also pretty sure recursively including template files is really a <em>wrong</em> way to do it...</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I had the same problem and I wrote a template tag. I know there are other tags like this out there but I needed to learn to make custom tags anyway :) I think it turned out pretty well.</p>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Django has a built in template helper for this exact scenario:</p>

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I had a similar issue, however I had first implemented the solution using JavaScript, and just afterwards considered how I would have done the same thing in django templates.</p>

<p>I used the serializer utility to turn a list off models into json, and used the json data as a basis for my hierarchy.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>here is a simple snippet that does the job</p>
