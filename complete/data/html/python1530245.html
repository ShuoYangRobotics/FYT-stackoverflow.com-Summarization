<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>That means that python user doesn't need to clean his dynamic created objects, like you're obligated to do it in C/C++.</p>

<p>Example in C++:</p>

<pre><code>char *ch = new char[100];
ch[0]='a';
ch[1]='b';
//....
// somewhere else in your program you need to release the alocated memory.
delete [] ch; 
// use *delete ch;* if you've initialized *ch with new char;
</code></pre>

<p>in python:</p>

<pre><code>def fun():
    a=[1, 2] #dynamic allocation
    a.append(3)
    return a[0]
</code></pre>

<p>python takes care about "a" object by itself.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>From Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage%5Fcollection%5F%28computer%5Fscience%29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_%28computer_science%29</a>:</p>

<p><em>Garbage collection frees the programmer from manually dealing with memory allocation and deallocation. As a result, certain categories of bugs are eliminated or substantially reduced:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Dangling pointer bugs, which occur
when a piece of memory is freed while
there are still pointers to it, and
one of those pointers is used.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Double free bugs, which occur when
the program attempts to free a<br />
region of memory that is already<br />
free.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Certain kinds of memory leaks, in
which a program fails to free<br />
memory that is no longer referenced<br />
by any variable, leading, over time,</em>
to memory exhaustion.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>...</p>

<p><em>The basic principles of garbage collection are:</em></p>

<ol>
<li><em>Find data objects in a program that cannot be accessed in the future</em></li>
<li><em>Reclaim the resources used by those objects</em></li>
</ol>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Others already answered the main question, but I'd like to add that garbage collection is possible in C++. It's not that automatic like Python's, but it's doable.</p>

<p>Smart pointers are probably the simplest form of C++ garbage collecting - <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/std/memory/auto%5Fptr/" rel="nofollow"><code>std::auto_ptr</code></a>, <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1%5F40%5F0/libs/smart%5Fptr/scoped%5Fptr.htm" rel="nofollow"><code>boost::scoped_ptr</code></a>, <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1%5F40%5F0/libs/smart%5Fptr/scoped%5Farray.htm" rel="nofollow"><code>boost::scoped_array</code></a> that release memory after being destroyed. There's an example in one of the earlier answers, that could be rewritten as:</p>

<pre><code>boost::scoped_array&lt;char&gt; ch(new char[100]);
ch[0] = 'a';
ch[1] = 'b';
// ...
// boost::scoped_array will be destroyed when out of scope, or during unwind
// (i.e. when exception is thrown), releasing the array's memory
</code></pre>

<p>There are also <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1%5F40%5F0/libs/smart%5Fptr/shared%5Fptr.htm" rel="nofollow"><code>boost::shared_ptr</code></a>, <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1%5F40%5F0/libs/smart%5Fptr/shared%5Farray.htm" rel="nofollow"><code>boost::shared_array</code></a> that implement reference counting (like Python). And there are full-blown garbage collectors that are meant to replace standard memory allocators, e.g. <a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans%5FBoehm/gc/" rel="nofollow">Boehm gc</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>It basically means the way they handle memory resources. When you need memory you usually ask for it to the OS and then return it back.</p>

<p>With python you don't need to worry about returning it, with C++ you need to track what you asked and return it back, one is easier, the other performant, you choose your tool.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>As you have got your answer, now it's better to know the cons of automated garbage collection:
it requires large amounts of extra memory and not suitable for hard real-time deadline applications.</p>
