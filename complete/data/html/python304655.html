<h3>Question (ID-304655):</h3><h2>The best way to invoke methods in Python class declarations?</h2><p>Say I am declaring a class <code>C</code> and a few of the declarations are very similar. I'd like to use a function <code>f</code> to reduce code repetition for these declarations. It's possible to just declare and use <code>f</code> as usual:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class C(object):
...     def f(num):
...             return '&lt;' + str(num) + '&gt;'
...     v = f(9)
...     w = f(42)
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; C.v
'&lt;9&gt;'
&gt;&gt;&gt; C.w
'&lt;42&gt;'
&gt;&gt;&gt; C.f(4)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: unbound method f() must be called with C instance as first argument (got int instance instead)
</code></pre>

<p>Oops! I've inadvertently exposed <code>f</code> to the outside world, but it doesn't take a <code>self</code> argument (and can't for obvious reasons). One possibility would be to <code>del</code> the function after I use it:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class C(object):
...     def f(num):
...             return '&lt;' + str(num) + '&gt;'
...     v = f(9)
...     del f
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; C.v
'&lt;9&gt;'
&gt;&gt;&gt; C.f
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
AttributeError: type object 'C' has no attribute 'f'
</code></pre>

<p>But what if I want to use <code>f</code> again later, after the declaration? It won't do to delete the function. I could make it "private" (i.e., prefix its name with <code>__</code>) and give it the <code>@staticmethod</code> treatment, but invoking <code>staticmethod</code> objects through abnormal channels gets very funky:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class C(object):
...     @staticmethod
...     def __f(num):
...             return '&lt;' + str(num) + '&gt;'
...     v = __f.__get__(1)(9)   # argument to __get__ is ignored...
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; C.v
'&lt;9&gt;'
</code></pre>

<p>I have to use the above craziness because <code>staticmethod</code> objects, which are descriptors, are not themselves callable. I need to recover the function wrapped by the <code>staticmethod</code> object before I can call it.</p>

<p>There has got to be a better way to do this. How can I cleanly declare a function in a class, use it during its declaration, and also use it later from within the class? Should I even be doing this?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Quite simply, the solution is that f does not need to be a member of the class. I am assuming that your thought-process has gone through a Javaish language filter causing the mental block. It goes a little something like this:</p>

<pre><code>def f(n):
    return '&lt;' + str(num) + '&gt;'

class C(object):

    v = f(9)
    w = f(42)
</code></pre>

<p>Then when you want to use f again, just use it</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; f(4)
'&lt;4&gt;'
</code></pre>

<p>I think the moral of the tale is "In Python, you don't <em>have</em> to force everything into a class". </p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Extending <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/304655/the-best-way-to-invoke-methods-in-python-class-declarations#304679">Ali A</a>'s answer,
if you really want to avoid f in the module namespace (and using a non-exported name like _f, or setting __all__ isn't sufficient), then
you could achieve this by creating the class within a closure.</p>

<pre><code>def create_C():
    def f(num):
        return '&lt;' + str(num) + '&gt;'

    class C(object):
        v = f(9)
        def method_using_f(self, x):  return f(x*2)
    return C

C=create_C()
del create_C
</code></pre>

<p>This way C has access to f within its definition and methods, but nothing else does (barring fairly involved introspection
of its methods (<code>C.method_using_f.im_func.func_closure</code>))</p>

<p>This is probably overkill for most purposes though - documenting that f is internal by using the "_" prefix nameing convention should
generally be sufficient.</p>

<p><strong>[Edit]</strong>  One other option is to hold a reference to the pre-wrapped function object in the methods you wish to use it in.  For example, by setting it as a default argument:</p>

<pre><code>class C(object):
    def f(num):
        return '&lt;' + str(num) + '&gt;'

    v = f(9)
    def method_using_f(self, x, f=f):  return f(x*2)

    del f
</code></pre>

<p>(Though I think the closure approach is probably better)</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>This is one possibility:</p>

<pre><code>class _C:
    # Do most of the function definitions in here
    @classmethod
    def f(cls):
        return 'boo'

class C(_C):
    # Do the subsequent decoration in here
    v = _C.f()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I believe you are trying to do this:</p>

<pre><code>class C():
...     class F():
...         def __call__(self,num):
...             return "&lt;"+str(num)+"&gt;"
...     f=F()
...     v=f(9)
&gt;&gt;&gt; C.v
'&lt;9&gt;'
&gt;&gt;&gt; C.f(25)
'&lt;25&gt;'
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Maybe there is better or more pythonic solution...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"declare a function in a class, use it during its declaration, and also use it later from within the class"</p>
  
  <p>Sorry. Can't be done.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Can't be done" doesn't seem to get along with Python</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>One option: write a better <code>staticmethod</code>:</p>

<pre><code>class staticfunc(object):
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func
    def __call__(self, *args, **kw):
        return self.func(*args, **kw)
    def __repr__(self):
        return 'staticfunc(%r)' % self.func
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Let's begin from the beginning.</p>

<p>"declare a function in a class, use it during its declaration, and also use it later from within the class"</p>

<p>Sorry.  Can't be done.  "In a class" contradicts "used during declaration".</p>

<ul>
<li>In a class means created as part of the declaration.</li>
<li>Used during declaration means it exists outside the class.  Often as a meta class.  However, there are other ways.</li>
</ul>

<p>It's not clear what C.w and C.v are supposed to be.  Are they just strings?  If so, an external function <code>f</code> is the best solution.  The "not clutter the namespace" is a bit specious.  After all, you want to use it again.</p>

<p>It's in the same module as C.  That's why Python has modules.  It binds the function and class together.</p>

<pre><code>import myCmod

myCmod.C.w
myCmod.C.v
myCmod.f(42)
</code></pre>

<p>If w and v aren't simple strings, there's a really good solution that gives a lot of flexibility.</p>

<p>Generally, for class-level ("static") variables like this, we can use other classes.  It's not possible to completely achieve the desired API, but this is close.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class F(object):
    def __init__( self, num ):
    	self.value= num
    	self.format= "&lt;%d&gt;" % ( num, )

&gt;&gt;&gt; class C(object):
    w= F(42)
    v= F(9)

&gt;&gt;&gt; C.w
&lt;__main__.F object at 0x00C58C30&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; C.w.format
'&lt;42&gt;'
&gt;&gt;&gt; C.v.format
'&lt;9&gt;'
</code></pre>

<p>The advantage of this is that F is a proper, first-class thing that can be extended.  Not a "hidden" thing that we're trying to avoid exposing.  It's a fact of life, so we might as well follow the Open/Closed principle and make it open to extension.</p>
