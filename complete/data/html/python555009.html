<h3>Question (ID-555009):</h3><h2>Euler problem number #4</h2><p>Using Python, I am trying to solve <a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=4" rel="nofollow">problem #4</a> of the <a href="http://projecteuler.net/" rel="nofollow">Project Euler</a> problems. Can someone please tell me what I am doing incorrectly?  The problem is to <strong>Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers</strong>.  Here is what I have thus far.</p>

<pre><code>import math

def main(): 
    for z in range(100, 1000):
    	for y in range(100, 1000):
    		for x in range(1, 1000000):
    			x = str(x)
    			if x == x[::-1] and x == z*y:
    				print x 

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

<br /><h3>Answers (Total-12):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Try computing x from the product of z and y rather than checking every number from 1 to a million. Think about it: if you were asked to calculate 500*240, which is more efficient - multiplying them, or counting up from 1 until you find the right answer?</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Some efficiency issues:</p>

<ol>
<li>start at the top (since we can use this in skipping a lot of calculations)</li>
<li>don't double-calculate</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>def is_palindrome(n):
    s = str(n)
    return s == s[::-1]

def biggest():
    big_x, big_y, max_seen = 0,0, 0
    for x in xrange(999,99,-1):
        for y in xrange(x, 99,-1):  # so we don't double count   
            if x*y &lt; max_seen: continue  # since we're decreasing, 
                                # nothing else in the row can be bigger
            if is_palindrome(x*y):
                big_x, big_y, max_seen = x,y, x*y

    return big_x,big_y,max_seen

biggest()
# (993, 913, 906609)

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Here's some general optimizations to keep in mind. The posted code handles all of this, but these are general rules to learn that might help with future problems:</p>

<p>1) if you've already checked z = 995, y = 990, you don't need to check z = 990, y = 995. Greg Lind handles this properly</p>

<p>2) You calculate the product of z*y and then you run x over a huge range and compare that value to y*z. For instance, you just calculated 900*950, and then you run x from 1000 to 1M and see if x = 900*950. DO you see the problem with this?</p>

<p>3) Also, what happens to the following code? (this is why your code is returning nothing, but you shouldn't be doing this anyway)</p>

<pre><code>x = str(100)
y = 100
print x == y
</code></pre>

<p>4) If you figure out (3), you're going to be printing a lot of information there. You need to figure out a way to store the max value, and only return that value at the end. </p>

<p>5) Here's a nice way to time your Euler problems:</p>

<pre><code>if __name__ == "__main__":
    import time
    tStart = time.time()
    print "Answer = " + main()
    print "Run time = " + str(time.time() - tStart)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>comparing string with an integer in</p>

<pre><code>x == z*y
</code></pre>

<p>there are also logical errors</p>

<p>start in reverse order <code>range(999, 99, -1)</code>. that'll be more efficient. remove third loop and second comparison altogether.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>rather than enumerating all products of 3-digit numbers (~900^2 iterations),
enumerate all 6- and 5-digit palyndromes (this takes ~1000 iterations);
then for each palyndrome decide whether it can be represented by a product
of two 3-digit numbers (if it can't, it should have a 4-digit prime factor,
so this is kind of easy to test).</p>

<p>also, you are asking about problem #4, not #3.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>The other advice here is great. This code also works. I start with 999 because we know the largest combination possible is 999*999. Not python, but some quickly done pseudo code. </p>

<pre><code>public static int problem4()
    {       
    int biggestSoFar=0;
        for(int i = 999; i&gt;99;i--){
            for(int j=999; j&gt;99;j--){
                if(isPaladrome(i*j))
                   if(i*j&gt;biggestSoFar)
                        biggestSoFar=i*j;
            }
        }
        return biggestSoFar;    
    }
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Here is my solution:</p>

<pre><code>polindroms = [(x, y, x * y) for x in range(100, 999) for y in range(100, 999) if str(x * y) == str(x * y)[::-1]]
print max(polindroms, key = lambda item : item[2])
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p><em>I removed my solution to pastebin so my crappy solution isn't immediatly visible...
<a href="http://pastebin.com/f107ef4e0" rel="nofollow">http://pastebin.com/f107ef4e0</a></em></p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Looking back at this now, I'm kinda ashamed =P.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong>: I'll actually try to address your question...</p>

<p>You don't have to do the x iteration at all. You can simply compute x as y * z. That will then print out all of the palindromes. Then you need to pick out the largest.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>The question states:</p>

<pre><code>What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143?
</code></pre>

<p>I solved this using C#, but the algorithm itself is language-agnostic.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a method for determining if a number is prime or not.  This can be brute-force (rather than using a much more efficient sieving algorithm) and looks like this:</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>private static long IsPrime(long input)
        {
            if ((input % 2) == 0)
            {
                return 2;
            }
            else if ((input == 1))
            {
                return 1;
            }
            else
            {
                long threshold = (Convert.ToInt64(Math.Sqrt(input)));
                long tryDivide = 3;
                while (tryDivide &lt; threshold)
                {
                    if ((input % tryDivide) == 0)

                        Console.WriteLine("Found a factor: " + tryDivide);
                        return tryDivide;
                    }
                    tryDivide += 2;
                }
                Console.WriteLine("Found a factor: " + input);
                return -1;
            }

<ol>
<li>Once I have a function to determine primality, I can use this function to find the highest prime factor</li>

<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>I will assume you actually mean <a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=4" rel="nofollow">Euler #4</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A palindromic number reads the same
  both ways. The largest palindrome made
  from the product of two 2-digit
  numbers is 9009 = 91  99.</p>
  
  <p>Find the largest palindrome made from

</blockquote>

<p>See my discussion solution in C# <a href="http://www.chrisballance.com/Blog/2009/02/10/FindingTheLargestPallindromeProductOfTwoThreeDigitIntegers.aspx" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  This may point you in the right direction for a Python implementation.</p>
<br /><b>#10</b><br /><p>If your program is running slow, and you have nested loops like this:</p>

<pre><code>for z in range(100, 1000):
    for y in range(100, 1000):
        for x in range(1, 1000000):
</code></pre>

<p>Then a question you should ask yourself is: "How many times will the body of the innermost loop execute?"  (the body of your innermost loop is the code that starts with: <code>x = str(x)</code>)</p>

<p>In this case, it's easy to figure out.  The outer loop will execute 900 times.  <em>For each iteration</em> the middle loop will also execute 900 times – that makes 900×900, or 810,000, times.  Then, for each of those 810,000 iterations, the inner loop will itself execute 999,999 times.  I think I need a long to calculate that:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 900*900*999999
809999190000L
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, you're doing your palindrome check almost <em>810 billion</em> times.  If you want to make it into the Project Euler recommended limit of 1 minute per problem, you might want to optimise a little :-) (see David's comment)</p>
<br /><b>#11</b><br /><p>This is what I did in Java:</p>

<pre><code>public class Euler0004
{
    //assumes positive int
    static boolean palindrome(int p)
    {
    	//if there's only one char, then it's
    	//  automagically a palindrome
    	if(p &lt; 10)
    		return true;

    	char[] c = String.valueOf(p).toCharArray();

    	//loop over the char array to check that
    	//  the chars are an in a palindromic manner
    	for(int i = 0; i &lt; c.length / 2; i++)
    		if(c[i] != c[c.length-1 - i])
    			return false;

    	return true;
    }


    public static void main(String args[]) throws Exception
    {
    	int num;
    	int max = 0;

    	//testing all multiples of two 3 digit numbers.
    	// we want the biggest palindrome, so we
    	// iterate backwards
    	for(int i = 999; i &gt; 99; i--)
    	{
    		// start at j == i, so that we
    		//  don't calc 999 * 998 as well as
    		//  998 * 999...
    		for(int j = i; j &gt; 99; j--)
    		{
    			num = i*j;

    			//if the number we calculate is smaller
    			//  than the current max, then it can't
    			//  be a solution, so we start again
    			if(num &lt; max)
    				break;

    			//if the number is a palindrome, and it's
    			//  bigger than our previous max, it
    			//  could be the answer
    			if(palindrome(num) &amp;&amp; num &gt; max)
    				max = num;
    		}
    	}

    	//once we've gone over all of the numbers
    	//  the number remaining is our answer
    	System.out.println(max);

    }
}
