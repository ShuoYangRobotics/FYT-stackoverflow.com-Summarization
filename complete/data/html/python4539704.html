<h3>Question (ID-4539704):</h3><h2>Can I do a reduce on a list comprehension into two lists, based on two values?</h2><p>I've got the following code.</p>

<pre><code>sum_review = reduce(add,[book['rw'] for book in books])
sum_rating = reduce(add,[book['rg'] for book in books])
items = len(books)
avg_review = sum_review/items
avg_rating = sum_rating/items
</code></pre>

<p>What I'd like is this.</p>

<pre><code>sum_review,sum_rating = reduce(add,([book['rw'],[book['rg']) for book in books])
items = len(books)
avg_review = sum_review/items
avg_rating = sum_rating/items
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously this doesn't work. How can I solve this redundancy, without a regular loop?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I'd avoid using reduce here. For something so simple use <code>sum</code>:</p>

<pre><code>sum_review = sum(book['rw'] for book in books)
sum_rating = sum(book['rg'] for book in books)
</code></pre>

<p>In my opinion this simpler version doesn't need refactoring to remove redundancy. With just two items (<code>rw</code> and <code>rg</code>) I think it's best to just leave it as it is.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><code>zip(*iterable)</code> is the Python way to transpose a list. I am not sure the readibility loss pays off, but this should work:</p>

<pre><code>sum_review, sum_rating = map(sum, zip(*((book["rw"], book["rg"]) for book in books)))
</code></pre>

<p>In any case, use built-in <code>sum</code> instead of <code>reduce(operator.add, ....)</code></p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You should prefer clarity over optimization.  In 3 years of using Python, I have only had to profile to discover performance bottlenecks twice.  Your original code is clear and efficient.  Compressing the first two lines into one hurts readability and barely impacts performance.</p>

<p>If I <em>had</em> to revise your code, it would like this:</p>

<pre><code>avg_review = sum(book['rw'] for book in books) / len(books)
avg_rating = sum(book['rg'] for book in books) / len(books)
</code></pre>

<p>(That's five lines of code down to two with an improvement of clarity.)</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><pre><code>sum_review, sum_rating = reduce(lambda a,b: (a[0] + b[0], a[1]+b[1]), ((book['rw'], book['rg']) for book in books), (0,0) )
items = len(books)
avg_review = sum_review/items
avg_rating = sum_rating/items
</code></pre>

<p>(tested)</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><blockquote>
  <p>How can I solve this redundancy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By making a function, of course:</p>

<pre><code>def average_value(items, key):
  values = [x[key] for x in items]
  return sum(items) / len(items)

avg_review, avg_rating = average_value(books, 'rw'), average_value(books, 'rg')
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I you really want a one-liner for that, then this could do the job (untested):</p>

<pre><code>sum_review, sum_rating = [reduce(add, [book[t] for book in books] for t in ('rw', 'rg')]
</code></pre>

<p>However, the readability is questionable...</p>
