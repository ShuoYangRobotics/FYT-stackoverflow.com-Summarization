<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>It appears the MySQLdb is pretty much a dead project. However, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pymysql/" rel="nofollow">pymysql</a> is a dbapi compliant, pure-python implementation of a mysql client, and it has python 3 support.</p>

<p>EDIT: There's also <a href="https://launchpad.net/myconnpy" rel="nofollow">MySQL Connector/Python</a>. Same idea.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>As for future plans of MySQLdb, you might want to ask the author (Andy Dustman).<br>
His blog is here: <a href="http://mysql-python.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://mysql-python.blogspot.com/</a></p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>not sure if you're still looking, but you could try this:

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You're probably better off using Python 2.x at the moment. It's going to be a while before all Python packages are ported to 3.x, and I expect writing a library or application with 3.x at the moment would be quite frustrating.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You can download the mysql-connector-python module compatible with Python3:  </p>

<p>Get the "source RPM", unzip it and use it (e.g. put it in your PYTHONPATH, and look at the examples).</p>
