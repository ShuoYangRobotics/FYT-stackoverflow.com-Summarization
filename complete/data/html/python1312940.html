<h3>Question (ID-1312940):</h3><h2>Python: what kind of literal delimiter is "better" to use?</h2><p>What is the best literal delimiter in Python and why? Single ' or double "? And most important, why?</p>

<p>I'm a beginner in Python and I'm trying to stick with just one. I know that in PHP, for example " is preferred, because PHP does not try to search for the 'string' variable. Is the same case in Python?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Consider these strings:</p>

<pre><code>"Don't do that."
'I said, "okay".'
"""She said, "That won't work"."""
</code></pre>

<p>Which quote is "best"?</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>' because it's one keystroke less than ". Save your wrists!</p>

<p>They're otherwise identical (except you have to escape whichever you choose to use, if they appear inside the string).</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Semantically there is no difference in Python; use either.  Python also provides the handy triple string delimiter """ or ''' which can simplify multi-line quotes.  There is also the raw string literal (r"..." or r'...') to inhibit \ escapes.  The <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/lexical%5Fanalysis.html#string-literals" rel="nofollow">Language Reference</a> has all the details.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>For string constants containing a <code>single quote</code> use the <code>double quote</code> as delimiter.</p>

<p>The other way around, if you need a <code>double quote</code> inside.</p>

<p>Quick, shiftless typing leads to <code>single quote</code> delimiters.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; "it's very simple"
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'reference to the "book"'
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Single and double quotes act identically in Python.  Escapes (<code>\n</code>) always work, and there is no variable interpolation.  (If you don't want escapes, you can use the <code>r</code> flag, as in <code>r"\n"</code>.)</p>

<p>Since I'm coming from a Perl background, I have a habit of using single quotes for plain strings and double-quotes for formats used with the <code>%</code> operator.  But there is really no difference.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Other answers are about nested quoting. Another point of view I've come across, but I'm not sure I subscribe to, is to use single-quotes(') for characters (which are strings, but ord/chr are quick picky) and to use double-quotes for strings. Which disambiguates between a string that is supposed to be one character and one that just happens to be one character.</p>

<p>Personally I find most touch typists aren't affected noticably by the "load" of using the shift-key. YMMV on that part. Going down the "it's faster to not use the shift" is a slippery slope. It's also faster to use hyper-condensed variable/function/class/module names. Everyone just so loves the fast and short 8.3 DOS files names too. :) Pick what makes semantic sense to you, then optimize.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>This is a rule I have heard about:</p>

<p>") If the string is for human consuption, that is interface text or output, use ""</p>

<p>') If the string is a specifier, like a dictionary key or an option, use ''</p>

<p>I think a well-enforced rule like that can make sense for a project, but it's nothing that I would personally care much about. I like the above, since I read it, but I always use "" (since I learned C first wayy back?).</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>I don't think there is a single best string delimiter. I like to use different delimiters to indicate different kinds of string.  Specifically, I like to use <code>"..."</code> to delimit stings that are used for interpolation or that are natural language messages, and <code>'...'</code> to delimit small symbol-like strings. This gives me a subtle extra clue to the expected use for the string literal.</p>

<p>I try to always use raw strings (<code>r"..."</code>) for regular expressions because (1) I don't have to escape backslash characters and (2) my editor recognises this convention and does syntax highlighting inside the regex.</p>
