<h3>Question (ID-191536):</h3><h2>Converting XML to JSON using Python?</h2><p>I've seen a fair share of ungainly XML->JSON code on the web, and having interacted with Stack's users for a bit, I'm convinced that this crowd can help more than the first few pages of Google results can.</p>

<p>So, we're parsing a weather feed, and we need to populate weather widgets on a multitude of web sites.  We're looking now into Python-based solutions.</p>

<p>This public <a href="http://rss.weather.com/weather/rss/local/14607?cm_ven=LWO&amp;cm_cat=rss&amp;par=LWO_rss" rel="nofollow">weather.com RSS feed</a> is a good example of what we'd be parsing (<em>our actual weather.com feed contains additional information because of a partnership w/them</em>).</p>

<p>In a nutshell, <strong>how should we convert XML to JSON using Python?</strong></p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>There is no "one-to-one" mapping between XML and JSON, so converting one to the other necessarily requires some understanding of what you want to <em>do</em> with the results.</p>

<p>That being said, Python's standard library has <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/lib/markup.html" rel="nofollow">several modules for parsing XML</a> (including DOM, SAX, and ElementTree).  And as of the latest release, Python 2.6, support for converting Python data structures to and from JSON is included in the <a href="http://docs.python.org/dev/library/json.html" rel="nofollow"><code>json</code> module</a>.</p>

<p>So the infrastructure is there.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Well, probably the simplest way is just parse the XML into dictionaries and then serialize that with simplejson. </p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>While built in libs for xml parsing are quite good I am partial to <a href="http://codespeak.net/lxml/" rel="nofollow">lxml</a>.</p>

<p>But for parsing RSS feed I'd recommend <a href="http://www.feedparser.org/" rel="nofollow">Universal Feed Parser</a>. (can also parse Atom)
Its main advantage is that it can digest even most malformed feeds.</p>

<p>Python 2.6 already includes Json parser, but newer <a href="http://bob.pythonmac.org/archives/2008/09/29/simplejson-201/" rel="nofollow">version with improved speed</a> is available as <a href="http://undefined.org/python/#simplejson" rel="nofollow">simplejson</a></p>

<p>Whit this tools building your app shouldn't be that difficult.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You may want to have a look at <a href="http://designtheory.org/library/extrep/designdb-1.0.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://designtheory.org/library/extrep/designdb-1.0.pdf</a>. This project starts off with an XML to JSON conversion of a large library of XML files. There was much research done in the conversion, and the most simple intuitive XML -> JSON mapping was produced (it is described early in the document). <strong>In summary, convert everything to a JSON object, and put repeating blocks as a list of objects.</strong></p>

<p>objects meaning key, value pairs (dictionary in python, hashmap in java, object in javascript, ...)</p>

<p>There is no mapping back to XML to get an identical document, the reason is, it is unknown whether a key, value pair was an attribute or an value, therefore that information is lost. (<strong>Subjective text follows</strong>) If you ask me, attributes are a hack to start; then again they worked well for HTML.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p><a href="http://jsonpickle.github.com/" rel="nofollow">jsonpickle</a> or if you're using feedparser, you can try <a href="http://www.silassewell.com/blog/2008/05/05/universal-feed-parser-json/" rel="nofollow">feed_parser_to_json.py</a></p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>There is a method to <strong>transport XML-based markup as JSON</strong> which allows it to be losslessly converted back to its original form. See <a href="http://jsonml.org/" rel="nofollow">http://jsonml.org/</a>. <p>It's a kind of XSLT of JSON. <em>Depending on your requirement I hope you will find it helpful</em> </p>
