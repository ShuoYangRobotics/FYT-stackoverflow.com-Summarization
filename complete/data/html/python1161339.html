<h3>Question (ID-1161339):</h3><h2>Can you point me to a large Python open-source project?</h2><p>I would like to see how a large (>40 developers) project done with Python looks like:</p>

<ul>
<li>how the code looks like</li>
<li>what folder structure they use </li>
<li>what tools they use</li>
<li>how they set up the collaboration environment</li>
<li>what kind of documentation they provide</li>
</ul>

<p>It doesn't matter what type of software it is (server, client, application, web, ...) but I would prefer something mature (version 1.0 already done)</p>

<p>Also, <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/" rel="nofollow">Twisted Matrix</a>.</p>

<p>I am not sure about the exact number of developers, though.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/" rel="nofollow">Trac</a> - which coincidentally is also usable for the collaboration environment part of your question.</p>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>There are about 40 developers working on <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/why/" rel="nofollow">the language itself</a>.  You can take a <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/faq/#how-do-i-get-a-checkout-of-the-repository-read-only-and-read-write" rel="nofollow">look at the repository</a> or <a href="http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.6.2/Python-2.6.2.tgz" rel="nofollow">download the source [ftp]</a> to see style, organization, &amp;c.</p>

<p><a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/LargePythonProjects" rel="nofollow">Here</a> are some other large Python projects (lines-of-code large).</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p><a href="http://chandlerproject.org/" rel="nofollow">Chandler</a> is a really huge one that had problems because of its size and the developers working on it, so you can learn from their failures. There's a <a href="http://www.dreamingincode.com/" rel="nofollow">book</a> written about it too.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wingware.com/" rel="nofollow">Wingware Python IDE</a> is a huge project, unfortunately it's closed source. But I think it's still interesting to see what a large desktop application is like in Python.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>The <a href="http://plone.org/" rel="nofollow">Plone</a> CMS and the <a href="http://www.zope.org/" rel="nofollow">Zope</a> application server on which Plone runs.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Perhaps more low-level than you're looking for but the <a href="http://numpy.org/" rel="nofollow">NumPy</a> and <a href="http://scipy.org" rel="nofollow">SciPy</a> projects are very mature, open source, numerical and scientific programming libraries. Although the API is Python, much of the low-level work is done in C or Fortran.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/" rel="nofollow">IPython</a> project is a pure-python project that is also quite mature.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Is <a href="http://github.com/pinax/pinax/tree/master" rel="nofollow">pinax</a> big enough? or <a href="http://github.com/ella/ella/tree/master" rel="nofollow">ella</a>? </p>

<p>I'm not sure of the developer count, but they are big and have a fair number of forks.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/" rel="nofollow">Django</a> would probably qualify.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>Pylons.</p>

<p>Even it is 0.9.8, it is quite mature</p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p><a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt4" rel="nofollow">PyQt4</a> is a large project.
