<h3>Question (ID-3288559):</h3><h2>Should I learn Python or Java to develop GUI apps for Ubuntu?</h2><p>I'm a long-time Mac user making the switch to Ubuntu. I have programming experience in Objective-C and REALbasic.</p>

<p>I want to develop native looking applications that will look pretty in the Gnome environment that Ubuntu uses.</p>

<p>Three questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What would fit better for me - Java or Python (I'm happy to learn something else if it is a better fit)</p></li>
<li><p>Is there a functional equivalent on Linux to Apple's Interface Builder for designing an app's interface?</p></li>
<li><p>Can anyone suggest a good (not overly complex) IDE to use?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>My GUI toolkit of choice is <a href="http://www.pygtk.org/" rel="nofollow">PyGTK</a> - the docs are great, and you can use <a href="http://glade.gnome.org/" rel="nofollow">Glade</a> to create UIs (the glade format itself is now deprecated, but it does <a href="http://library.gnome.org/devel/pygtk/stable/class-gtkbuilder.html" rel="nofollow">GTKBuilder</a> too...). At the very least, Glade is a good tool for mocking things up if you like to keep it all in code.</p>

<p>PyGTK apps look exactly like typical GNOME apps, and as far as I'm aware KDE users can simply install some magical Qt/GTK themeing engine to have them look like typical KDE apps too. One example of a PyGTK app is <a href="http://soundconverter.berlios.de/" rel="nofollow">SoundConverter</a>.</p>

<p>GObject is the abstraction of the event-driven subsystem underneath GTK, and it has some excellent Python bindings, although there can be a fair bit more boilerplate that Python coders might be used to... which is still 10¹³x less boilerplate than any other language :P</p>

<p>Pure GObject is great for the non-UI parts of your app (the M in MVC, in other words). Set up your signals and properties, and just connect them up. <a href="http://www.pygtk.org/articles/subclassing-gobject/sub-classing-gobject-in-python.htm" rel="nofollow">This tutorial</a> shows you how to use it.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>If you want to target Gnome, I would recommend using the GTK.</p>

<ol>
<li>GTK has <a href="http://www.gtk.org/language-bindings.html" rel="nofollow">a lot of bindings</a>. Given your background in Objective-C, I would recommend Vala (which seems to basically be C with some high-level additions to fit the GTK object system), C++, or (if you really feel like it) plain C. Don't let such a "recommendation" stop you from experimenting with other languages though.</li>
<li><a href="http://glade.gnome.org/" rel="nofollow">Glade</a> seems to be what you seek. It ouputs XML files, and can thus be integrated into a GTK project in any language.</li>
<li>The IDE that seems closest to GTK would be <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/anjuta/" rel="nofollow">Anjuta</a>. (It also integrates Glade)</li>
</ol>

<p>You can also develop GTK applications with Mono (in C#, using the MonoDevelop IDE).</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>My choice for an IDE is <a href="http://netbeans.org" rel="nofollow">Netbeans</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>multi-language (Java, Python, PHP, Ruby etc)</li>
<li>integrated <a href="http://netbeans.org/features/java/swing.html" rel="nofollow">Matisse GUI builder</a> (Java, Swing-based) drag and drop widgets, it is very mature. You can make the Java UI app looke native on ubuntu using <a href="http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E17409_01/javase/tutorial/uiswing/lookandfeel/plaf.html" rel="nofollow">Swing Look and Feel</a> set to GTK.</li>
</ul>

<p>With Python you would have to use a <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming" rel="nofollow">GUI Toolkit binding</a>, I dont know about GUI builders in this area.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>To make things look pretty in gnome, you might want to use the <a href="http://www.gtk.org/" rel="nofollow">gnome ui toolkit</a>. You can design your gui in <a href="http://glade.gnome.org/" rel="nofollow">glade</a>. Bindings are available for most languages.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>My personal preference is for Python.  I have done Java development in the past, but really do not like it - Java syntax is massively verbose which destroys readability, and it lacks features that I think are essential for any modern programming language such as first-class functions and closures.  Without these features it can take a huge amount of code to do things that are trivial in a modern language.</p>

<p>Python is a good fit for linux development.  It is pre-installed as others have said, and many Linux utilities are written in it.</p>

<p>You have a wide choice when it comes to GUI development - wxPython , PyGTK and PyQt are the main contenders, and there is also Tkinter which is a bit old fashioned but still usable.  PyQt has the most restrictive license (free for non-commercial use, but you need to pay if you want to sell PyQt applications).  The underlying Qt C++ code is LGPL however, and Nokia (owners of Qt) are working on their own open source Python bindings called <a href="http://www.pyside.org/" rel="nofollow">Pyside</a>.</p>

<p>wxPython has several GUI builders, such as wxGlade and Boa Constrictor.  For PyQt you can use the excellent GUI builder that comes with Qt.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You might also consider looking at vala (http://live.gnome.org/Vala). The syntax is similar to c# or java and it compiles to c code that uses the gobject runtime, so in my opinion it is the perfect match to create gtk/gnome applicatons.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Can't say anything about gui interface builders, but:<br/>
1. Java has better IDEs. But Java is not as wide-spread as Python on linux.On ubuntu, for example, python is preinstalled.<br/>
2. For your own scripts|small apps Python is way better than Java. Java has overhead code, which can be useful and convenient in enterprise development, but useless and painful in small apps.<br/>
3. Java is more server-side language, so you experience in creating Swing/AWT GUI with it will probably be useless.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Take a look at 'Quickly'</p>
