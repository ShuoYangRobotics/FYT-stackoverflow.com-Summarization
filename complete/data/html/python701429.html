<h3>Question (ID-701429):</h3><h2>Library/tool for drawing ternary/triangle plots</h2><p>I need to draw <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary%5Fplot" rel="nofollow">ternary/triangle plots</a> representing mole fractions (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, <em>z</em>) of various substances/mixtures (<em>x</em> + <em>y</em> + <em>z</em> = 1). Each plot represents iso-valued substances, e.g. substances which have the same melting point. The plots need to be drawn on the same triangle with different colors/symbols and it would be nice if I could also connect the dots.</p>

<p>I have looked at matplotlib, R and gnuplot, but they don't seem to be able to draw this kind of plot. The 3rd party <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ade4/" rel="nofollow">ade4</a> package for R seems to be able to draw it, but I'm not sure if I can draw multiple plots on the same triangle.</p>

<p>I need something that runs under Linux or Windows. I'm open to any suggestions, including libraries for other languages, e.g. Perl, PHP, Ruby, C# and Java.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>R has an external package called <a href="http://www.math.yorku.ca/SCS/vcd/" rel="nofollow">VCD</a> which should do what you want. The documentation is very good (122 page manual distributed w/ the package); there's also a book by the same name, <em>Visual Display of Quantitative Information</em>, by the package's author (Michael Friendly).</p>

<p>To create ternary plots using vcd, just call 'ternaryplot()' and pass in an n x 3 matrix. To generate the diagram below, i just created some fake data to represent four different chemical mixtures, each comprised of varying fractions of three substances (x, y, z). I scaled the input (so x + y + z = 1) but the function will do it for you if you pass in a value for its 'scale' parameter (in fact, the default is 1, which i believe is what your question requires). I used different colors &amp; symbols to represent the four data points, but you can also just use a single color/symbol and label each point (via the 'id' argument). </p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Created a very basic script for generating ternary (or more) plots.  No gridlines or ticklines, but those wouldn't be too hard to add using the vectors in the "basis" array.</p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>ChloÃ« Lewis developed <em>a triangle-plot general class, meant to support the soil texture triangle</em>
with Python and Matplotlib. It's available here <a href="http://nature.berkeley.edu/~chlewis/Sourcecode.html" rel="nofollow">http://nature.berkeley.edu/~chlewis/Sourcecode.html</a></p>

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I just discovered a tool which uses Python/Matplotlib to generate ternary plots called wxTernary. It's available via <a href="http://wxternary.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">http://wxternary.sourceforge.net/</a> -- I was able to successfully generate a ternary plot on the first try. </p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Find a vector drawing library and draw it from scratch if you can't find an easier way to do it. </p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>there is a R package named soiltexture (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/soiltexture/index.html) it's aimed at soil texture triangle plot, but can be customized for some aspects</p>
