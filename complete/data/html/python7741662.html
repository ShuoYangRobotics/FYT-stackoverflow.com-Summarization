<h3>Question (ID-7741662):</h3><h2>Build a list using specific keys in a dict (python)?</h2><p>I'm implementing the Dijkstra search algorithm in Python. At the end of the search, I reconstruct the shortest path using a predecessor map, starting with the destination node's predecessor. For example:</p>

<pre><code>path = []
path.append(destination)
previous = predecessor_map[destination]
while previous != origin:
    path.append(previous)
    previous = predecessor_map[previous]
</code></pre>

<p>Is there any way to do this with less lines of code (e.g. list comprehension)?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The only suggestion that I have is to get rid of the slight code duplication:</p>

<pre><code>path = []
previous = destination
while previous != origin:
    path.append(previous)
    previous = predecessor_map[previous]
</code></pre>

<p>Beyond that, I think your code is actually very clear and is unlikely to benefit from any attempts to shorten it.</p>

<p>Lastly, it is worth noting that the above also works when <code>destination == origin</code>, whereas your original version most probably doesn't (depends on how exactly <code>predecessor_map</code> is populated). Don't know if this is relevant to your use cases.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>This might work:</p>

<pre><code>path = [destination]
path += iter(lambda: predecessor_map[path[-1]], origin)
</code></pre>

<p>It behaves the same as your original code. But what you've already written is fine as is.</p>

<p>If <code>destination</code> could be equal to <code>origin</code>:</p>

<pre><code>path = []
path += iter(lambda: predecessor_map[path[-1]] if path else destination, origin)
</code></pre>

<p>It behaves the same as <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7741662/build-a-list-using-specific-keys-in-a-dict-python/7741801#7741801">@aix's code</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><pre><code>def backwalk(mymap, start, origin):
    yield start
    current = mymap[start]
    while current != origin:
        yield current
        current = mymap[current]

path = list(backwalk(predecessor_map, destination, origin))
</code></pre>

<p>This separates the walking and collecting tasks.</p>

<p>If you can ensure that you never start with the origin, you can simplify to</p>

<pre><code>def backwalk(mymap, start, origin):
    current = start
    while current != origin:
        yield current
        current = mymap[current]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You can recursively traverse the edges assuming <code>predecessor_map</code> is a <code>dict</code> mapping node to parent node and that <code>None</code> is the root:</p>

<pre><code>predecessor_map={0: None, 1: None, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 0, 5: 1}
</code></pre>

<p>Define a recursive function that traverses the tree in reverse:</p>

<pre><code>def path(node, predecessors):
    return [None] if node is None else [node] + path(predecessors.get(node), predecessors)
</code></pre>

<p>Or, if you dare, a Y combinator:</p>

<pre><code>Y=lambda f: (lambda x: f(lambda *args: x(x)(*args)))(lambda x: f(lambda *args: x(x)(*args)))
path=Y(lambda f: lambda node, p: [None] if node is None else [node] + f(p.get(node), p))
</code></pre>

<p>In use (using list comprehension):</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print [node for node in path(None, predecessor_map)]
[None]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print [node for node in path(0, predecessor_map)]
[0, None]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print [node for node in path(1, predecessor_map)]
[1, None]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print [node for node in path(2, predecessor_map)]
[2, 1, None]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print [node for node in path(3, predecessor_map)]
[3, 1, None]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print [node for node in path(4, predecessor_map)]
[4, 0, None]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print [node for node in path(5, predecessor_map)]
[5, 1, None]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>One more possible solution is to use functional style programming with deferred output:</p>

<pre><code>from itertools import tee, chain, imap, takewhile

predecessor_map = {2:1, 3:2}
destination = 3
origin = 1

def backwalk(predecessor_map, start, origin):

    def deffered_output():
        for i in output:
            yield i

    result, a = tee(deffered_output())
    b = imap(predecessor_map.get,a)
    output = takewhile(lambda x: x!=origin,chain([start],b))

    return result

print(list(backwalk(predecessor_map,destination,origin)))
</code></pre>

<p>I personally wouldn't use this approach. But it's interesting for training though.</p>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong>
The key element is <code>deferred_output</code> which postpones the calls to <code>output</code>.
Then we split <code>output</code> into 2 iterators using <code>tee</code>.
Then we apply <code>predecessor_map.get</code> to the second iterator called <code>a</code> and assign the new iterator to <code>b</code>.
Then we control the output with <code>takewhile</code> and stop when <code>origin</code> is reached.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I don't think you can do this iteration with a comprehension. Maybe you could simplify it a little, like this:</p>

<pre><code>    path, previous = [], destination
    while True:
        path.append(previous)
        previous = predecessor_map[previous]
        if previous == origin:
            break
</code></pre>

<p>The above loop would look nicer with a do..while , but Python lacks it</p>
