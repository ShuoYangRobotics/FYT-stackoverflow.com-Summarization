<h3>Question (ID-3278263):</h3><h2>In Python - a way to choose which dictionary to iterate over (and manipulate values in)</h2><p>Here's my problem:</p>

<p>Lets say I have two dictionaries, dict_a and dict_b. </p>

<p>Each of them have similar keys and values that I can manipulate in the same way, and in fact that's what I'm doing in a large piece of code. Only I don't want to have to write it twice. However, I can't do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>if choose_a == 1:
    for x and y in dict_a.iteritems():
    # goto line 20

if choose_b == 1:
    for x and y in dict_b.iteritems():
    # goto line 20

 # line 20
 # do stuff with x and y.
</code></pre>

<p>Except I have no idea what to do in a situation like this. If there is a like thread, please point me to it, and forgive me if I have violated anything (first post). Thanks in advance, I appreciate any help. </p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Perhaps do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>if choose_a == 1: the_dict=dict_a
elif choose_b == 1: the_dict=dict_b

for x,y in the_dict.iteritems():
    # do stuff with x and y.
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><pre><code>def do_stuff( d ):
  for x and y in d.iteritems():
    whatever with x and y
if choose_a == 1: do_stuff( dict_a )    
if choose_b == 1: do_stuff( dict_b )
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>What do you want to happen if both <code>choose_a</code> and <code>choose_b</code> are true?  What if neither of them is true?  Is either of these conditions at all possible...?</p>

<p>Can you afford to move all the "stuff" to a separate function as a couple of answers have suggested, or would the resulting scope change be a problem?</p>

<p>As you see, you've left many things underspecified (or totally unspecified).  Assuming the worst...:</p>

<ol>
<li>both the <code>choose_...</code> variables could be true, in which case you need to use both dicts</li>
<li>both the <code>choose_...</code> variables could be false, in which case you want to do nothing</li>
<li>you need the "stuff" to happen within the current function due to scoping issues,</li>
</ol>

<p>then...:</p>

<pre><code>thedicts = []
if choose_a == 1: thedicts.append(dict_a)
if choose_b == 1: thedicts.append(dict_b)

for d in thedicts:
    for x, y in d.iteritems():
        ...do stuff _locally_ with x and y...
</code></pre>

<p>You could express the building of the <code>thedicts</code> list more concisely, but, I think, not as clearly, by rolling it up in the <code>for</code> statement, e.g. as follows...:</p>

<pre><code>for d in [d for d, c in zip((dict_a, dict_b), (choose_a, choose_b)) if c]:
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Just define a fuction.</p>

<pre><code>def do_stuff(x, y):
    # Do stuff
    pass

if choose_a == 1:
    for x and y in dict_a.iteritems():
    do_stuff(x, y)

if choose_b == 1:
    for x and y in dict_b.iteritems():
    do_stuff(x, y)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>How about this:</p>

<pre><code>d = dict_a if choose_a else dict_b
for x, y in d.items():
    # do stuff with x and y
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously that assumes that you're going to use one or the other; pretty simple to add an if statement if that's not the case though. Also, your <code>x and y</code> syntax is invalid, but I guess you'll figure that out :)</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You can put the two dictionaries in a <code>dict</code> and then select them with a key</p>

<p>for example:</p>

<pre><code>choice = 'A'  # or choice = 'B'
working_dict = {'A': dict_a, 'B': dict_b}[choice]
for x,y in working_dict.iteritems():
    # do stuff with x and y
</code></pre>

<p>This is slightly different from your approach using two flags. If you are stuck with that scheme you could use something like this to set the value of <code>choice</code></p>

<pre><code>if choose_a == 1:
    choice = 'A'
elif choose_b == 1:
    choice = 'B'
else: 
    pass # maybe this should raise an exception?
</code></pre>

<p>Perhaps it is just easier to write it this way:</p>

<pre><code>if choose_a == 1:
    working_dict = dict_a
elif choose_b == 1:
    working_dict = dict_b
else: 
    pass # maybe this should raise an exception?

for x,y in working_dict.iteritems():
    # do stuff with x and y
</code></pre>
