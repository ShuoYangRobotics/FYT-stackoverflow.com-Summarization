<h3>Question (ID-1689032):</h3><h2>Is there a more succinct / pythonic way to do this? (counting longest seq of heads, tails in coin flips)</h2><p>Count the longest sequence of heads and tails in 200 coin flips.<br>
I did this - is there a niftier way to do it in python?  (without being too obfuscated)</p>

<pre><code>import random

def toss(n):
    count = [0,0]
    longest = [0,0]
    for i in xrange(n):
        coinface = random.randrange(2)
        count[coinface] += 1
        count[not coinface] = 0

        if count[coinface] &gt; longest[coinface]:
            longest[coinface] = count[coinface]      
        #print coinface, count, longest  

    print "longest sequence heads %d, tails %d" %tuple(longest)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    toss(200)

    lst = [random.randrange(2) for i in range(num)]
    lst = [(i, len(list(j))) for i, j in itertools.groupby(lst)]
    tails = max(j for i, j in lst if i)
    heads = max(j for i, j in lst if not i)

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><pre><code>import collections, itertools, random

def makesequence(choices=2, length=200):
  return [random.randrange(choices) for _ in itertools.repeat(None, length)]

def runlengths(sequence):
  runlength_by_item = collections.defaultdict(set)
  for key, group in itertools.groupby(sequence):
    runlength_by_item[key].add(sum(1 for _ in group))
  return dict((k, max(v)) for k, v in runlength_by_item.items())
</code></pre>

<p>As you'll notice, this is much more "decoupled" -- <code>runlengths</code> is a completely general way to determine the maximal run-lengths of different hashable items in any iterable (highly reusable if you need such run-lengths in a variety of different contexts), just as <code>makesequence</code> is a completely general way to make a list of random numbers given list length and number of choices for each random number.  Putting these two together may not offer an optimal point-solution to a given, highly specific problem, but it will come close, and building up your little library of reusable "building blocks" will have much higher longer-term returns than just solving each specific problem by entirely dedicated code.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You can use <code>itertools</code>, which is a much more Pythonic way to do this:</p>

<pre><code>def toss(n):
    rolls = [random.randrange(2) for i in xrange(n)]
    maximums = [0, 0]
    for which, grp in itertools.groupby(rolls):
        maximums[which] = max(len(list(grp)), maximums[which])

    print "Longest sequence of heads %d, tails %d" % tuple(maximums)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Another inefficient solution :-)</p>

<pre><code>import random, re
s = ''.join(str(random.randrange(2)) for c in range(10))
print s
print max(re.findall(r'0+', s))
print max(re.findall(r'1+', s))

&gt;&gt;&gt;

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def toss(count):
        result = []
        for i in range(count):
            result.append("HT"[random.randrange(0, 2)])
        return ''.join(result)

&gt;&gt;&gt; s = toss(200)
&gt;&gt;&gt; h_max = max(len(x) for x in s.split("T"))
&gt;&gt;&gt; t_max = max(len(x) for x in s.split("H"))
&gt;&gt;&gt; print h_max, t_max

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>This isn't really pythonic so much as tortured, but here's a short version (with meaningless 1-character variable names, no less!)</p>

<pre><code>import random
x = ''.join([chr(random.randrange(2)) for i in range(200)])
print max([len(s) for s in x.split(chr(0)) + x.split(chr(1))])
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>It is probably an axiom that any code can be made more succinct.  Yours looks perfectly pythonic, though.</p>

<p>Actually, on reflection perhaps there is no succinctness axiom like that.  If <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/succinct" rel="nofollow">succinct</a> means "marked by compact precise expression without wasted words," and if by "words" we mean words of code and not of memory, then a single word program cannot be made more succinct (unless, perhaps, it is the "exit" program).</p>

<p>If <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/pythonic" rel="nofollow">pythonic</a> means "of extraordinary size and power", then it seems antagonistic to succinctness unless we restrict our definition to power only.   I'm not convinced your program resembles a prophetic oracle at all, although you might implement it as an ascii portrait of a particular prophetic oracle.   It doesn't look like a snake, so there's room for improvement there too.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a fast algorithm, then you can use the algorithm I developed recently for an interview question that asked for the longest string of consecutive letters in a string. <a href="http://www.iwebthereforeiam.com/iwebthereforeiam/2009/11/interview-question-part-ii-longest-sequence-in-string.html" rel="nofollow">See blog entry here</a>.</p>

<p>This algorithm is O(n) in worst case (all coin flips are identical) or O(n/m) in average case (where m is the length of the longest match). Feel free to correct me on this.</p>

<p>The code is not especially pythonic (i.e. it does not use list comprehensions or <code>itertools</code> or other stuff). It's in python and it's a good algorithm.</p>

<h2>Micro-optimizations</h2>

<p>For the micro-optimization crowd, here are changes that make this really scream in python 2.6 on a Windows Vista laptop:</p>

<pre><code>def find_left(s, midc, mid, left):
    j = mid - 1
    while j &gt;= 0:
        if s[j] != midc:
            return j + 1
        j -=  1
    return left
def find_right(s, midc, mid, right):
    k = mid+1
    while k &lt; right:
        if s[k] != midc:
            return k
        k += 1
    return right
</code></pre>

<p>Timing results for 1000 iterations with <code>timeit</code>:</p>

<pre><code>range: 2.670
xrange: 0.3268
while-loop: 0.255
</code></pre>

<p>Adding <code>psyco</code> import to the file:</p>

<pre><code>try:
    import psyco
    psyco.full()
except ImportError:
    pass
</code></pre>

<p>0.011 on 1000 iterations with <code>psyco</code> and while-loop. So with judicious micros-optimizations and importing <code>psyco</code>, the code runs 250-ish times faster.</p>
