<h3>Question (ID-942328):</h3><h2>Help me to port this NetHack function to Python please!</h2><p>I am trying to write a Python function which returns the same moon phase value as in the game NetHack. This is found in <a href="http://nethack.wikia.com/wiki/Source:Hacklib.c#phase%5Fof%5Fthe%5Fmoon" rel="nofollow">hacklib.c</a>.</p>

<p>I have tried to simply copy the corresponding function from the NetHack code but I don't believe I am getting the correct results.</p>

<p>The function which I have written is <code>phase_of_the_moon()</code>.</p>

<p>The functions <code>position()</code> and <code>phase()</code>, I found on the net, and I am using them as an indication of the success of my function. They are very accurate and give results which approximately match the nethack.alt.org server (see <a href="http://alt.org/nethack/moon/pom.txt" rel="nofollow">http://alt.org/nethack/moon/pom.txt</a>). What I am after however is an exact replication of the original NetHack function, idiosyncrasies intact.</p>

<p>I would expect my function and the 'control' function to give the same moon phase at least, but currently they do not and I'm not sure why!!</p>

<p>Any help would be appreciated,</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Here is the NetHack code:</p>

<pre><code>/*
 * moon period = 29.53058 days ~= 30, year = 365.2422 days
 * days moon phase advances on first day of year compared to preceding year
 *  = 365.2422 - 12*29.53058 ~= 11
 * years in Metonic cycle (time until same phases fall on the same days of
 *  the month) = 18.6 ~= 19
 * moon phase on first day of year (epact) ~= (11*(year%19) + 29) % 30
 *  (29 as initial condition)
 * current phase in days = first day phase + days elapsed in year
 * 6 moons ~= 177 days
 * 177 ~= 8 reported phases * 22
 * + 11/22 for rounding
 */
int
phase_of_the_moon() 	/* 0-7, with 0: new, 4: full */
{
    register struct tm *lt = getlt();
    register int epact, diy, goldn;

    diy = lt-&gt;tm_yday;
    goldn = (lt-&gt;tm_year % 19) + 1;
    epact = (11 * goldn + 18) % 30;
    if ((epact == 25 &amp;&amp; goldn &gt; 11) || epact == 24)
        epact++;

    return( (((((diy + epact) * 6) + 11) % 177) / 22) &amp; 7 );
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the <code>getlt()</code> function (also in hacklib.c):</p>

<pre><code>static struct tm *
getlt()
{
    time_t date;

#if defined(BSD) &amp;&amp; !defined(POSIX_TYPES)
    (void) time((long *)(&amp;date));
#else
    (void) time(&amp;date);
#endif
#if (defined(ULTRIX) &amp;&amp; !(defined(ULTRIX_PROTO) || defined(NHSTDC))) || (defined(BSD) &amp;&amp; !defined(POSIX_TYPES))
    return(localtime((long *)(&amp;date)));
#else
    return(localtime(&amp;date));
#endif
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is my Python code:</p>

<pre><code>from datetime import date

def phase_of_the_moon():
   lt = date.today()

   diy = (lt - date(lt.year, 1, 1)).days
   goldn = ((lt.year - 1900) % 19) + 1
   epact = (11 * goldn + 18) % 30;
   if ((epact == 25 and goldn &gt; 11) or epact == 24):
      epact += 1
   return ( (((((diy + epact) * 6) + 11) % 177) / 22) &amp; 7 )

   if now is None: 
      now = datetime.datetime.now()

   diff = now - datetime.datetime(2001, 1, 1)
   days = dec(diff.days) + (dec(diff.seconds) / dec(86400))
   lunations = dec("0.20439731") + (days * dec("0.03386319269"))

   return lunations % dec(1)

   pos = position()
   phasename = phase(pos)
   roundedpos = round(float(pos), 3)
   print "%s (%s)" % (phasename, roundedpos)

<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The code as written is largely untestable - and you need to make it testable.  So, you need the C code to be:</p>

<pre><code>int
phase_of_the_moon()     /* 0-7, with 0: new, 4: full */
{
    register struct tm *lt = getlt();
    return testable_potm(lt);
}

static int
testable_potm(const struct tm *lt)
{
    register int epact, diy, goldn;

    diy = lt-&gt;tm_yday;
    goldn = (lt-&gt;tm_year % 19) + 1;
    epact = (11 * goldn + 18) % 30;
    if ((epact == 25 &amp;&amp; goldn &gt; 11) || epact == 24)
        epact++;

    return( (((((diy + epact) * 6) + 11) % 177) / 22) &amp; 7 );
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can run tests with multiple values of time.  The alternative way to do this is to fake <code>getlt()</code> instead.</p>

<p>You then need parallel changes in your Python code.  Then you create a file of <code>time_t</code> values which can be read by both Python and C, and then converted into an appropriate structure (via <code>localtime()</code> in C).  Then you can see where things are deviating.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><strong>Edit:</strong> Turns out both of the "problems" I spotted here were based on a misunderstanding of the <code>tm</code> struct.  I'll leave the answer intact for the sake of the discussion in the comments, but save your votes for someone who might actually be correct. ;-)</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>Caveat: I'm not terribly familiar with C time constructs; I'm mostly going off the field documentation supplied for <code>strftime</code>.</p>

<p>I see two "bugs" in your port.  First, I believe <code>tm_year</code> is intended to be the year without century, not the year minus 1900, so, <code>goldn</code> should be <code>((lt.year % 100) % 19) + 1</code>.  Secondly, your calculation for <code>diy</code> is zero-based, whereas <code>tm_yday</code> appears (again, from the docs) to be one-based.  However, I'm not certain about the latter, as fixing just the <code>goldn</code> line gives a correct result (at least for today), where as fixing both gives the wrong answer:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def phase_of_the_moon():
    lt = date.today()

    diy = (lt - date(lt.year, 1, 1)).days
    goldn = ((lt.year % 100) % 19) + 1
    epact = (11 * goldn + 18) % 30
    if ((epact == 25 and goldn &gt; 11) or epact == 24):
        epact += 1
    return ( (((((diy + epact) * 6) + 11) % 177) / 22) &amp; 7 )

&gt;&gt;&gt; phase_of_the_moon():
3
</code></pre>

<p>Again, this is mostly guesswork.  Please be kind. :-)</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Curiously, when I compile and run the nethack example I get "2" as the answer ("First Quarter" which is the same as your port)</p>

}
</code></pre>

<p>output:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; a.out
phase of the moon 2
</code></pre>

<p>But that doesn't seem like the right answer, as today, weatherunderground.com and alt.org reports the phase of the moon as "Waxing Gibbous" (a.k.a 3).</p>

<p>I tried remove the "-1900" but that didn't result in the right answer either.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I like to think I know a thing or two about calendars, so let's see if I can clear a few things up.</p>

<p>The Catholic Church defines the date of Easter in terms of lunar phases (this is why the date jumps around from year to year). Because of this, it needs to be able to calculate the approximate moon phase, and its algorithm for doing so is explained <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computus" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>I have not done very detailed checking, but it appears that the NetHack algorithm is based heavily on the Church's algorithm. The NetHack algorithm seems to, like the Church's algorithm, pay attention only to the calendar date, ignoring time zones and the time of day.</p>

<p>The NetHack algorithm uses only the year and the day of the year. I can tell from examining the code that, to be Y2K compatible, that tm_year has to be the year minus 1900.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Following code is <a href="http://www.daniweb.com/code/post968407.html" rel="nofollow">borrowed from this site</a>, pasting it here for easy reference (and in case the other site goes down). Seems to do what you want.</p>

<p>You can use the <code>time</code> module to get the <strong>current local time</strong>. Heres how I did it (paste below posted code to testrun):</p>

<pre><code>import time
tm = time.localtime()
month = tm.tm_mon
day = tm.tm_mday
year = tm.tm_year
date, status, light = moon_phase(month, day, year)
print "moon phase on %s is %s, light = %d%s" % (date, status, light, '%')
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>moon phase on 22Dec2009 is waxing crescent (increasing to full), light = 34%
</code></pre>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I'm long late on this thread but fwiw, the alt.org server's display of pom via the web only updates on cron a couple times per day so if you're off by just a bit from it, that could be the reason. The game itself runs from whatever is in the nethack code itself so doesn't suffer the same caching issue. -drew (alt.org owner)</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Here is my conversion of it, and I've tested this against the C code by passing in values from xrange(0, 1288578760, 3601), and they both return the same values.  Note that I've changed it so that you can pass the seconds since epoch, so that I could test it against the C version for a third of a million different values.  The "seconds" value is optional</p>
