<h3>Question (ID-1630320):</h3><h2>What is the pythonic way to detect the last element in a python 'for' loop?</h2><p>I'd like to know the best way (more compact and "pythonic" way) to do a special treatment for the last element in a for loop. There is a piece of code that should be called only <em>between</em> elements, being suppressed in the last one.</p>

<p>Here is how I currently do it:</p>

<pre><code>for i, data in enumerate(data_list):
    code_that_is_done_for_every_element
    if i != len(data_list) - 1:
        code_that_is_done_between_elements
</code></pre>

<p>Is there any better way?</p>

<p>Note: I don't want to make it with hacks such as using <code>reduce</code> ;)</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Most of the times it is easier (and cheaper) to make the <em>first</em> iteration the special case instead of the last one:</p>

<pre><code>first = True
for data in data_list:
    if first:
        first = False
    else:
        between_items()

    item()
</code></pre>

<p>This will work for any iterable, even for those that have no <code>len()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>file = open('/path/to/file')
for line in file:
    process_line(line)

    # No way of telling if this is the last line!
</code></pre>

<p>Apart from that, I don't think there is a generally superior solution as it depends on what you are trying to do. For example, if you are building a string from a list, it's naturally better to use <code>str.join()</code> than using a <code>for</code> loop “with special case”.</p>

<hr>

<p>Using the same principle but more compact:</p>

<pre><code>for i, line in enumerate(data_list):
    if i &gt; 0:
        between_items()
    item()
</code></pre>

<p>Looks familiar, doesn't it? :)</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The 'code between' is an example of the <strong>Head-Tail</strong> pattern.</p>

<p>You have an item, which is followed by a sequence of ( between, item ) pairs.  You can also view this as a sequence of (item, between) pairs followed by an item.  It's generally simpler to take the first element as special and all the others as the "standard" case.</p>

<p>Further, to avoid repeating code, you have to provide a function or other object to contain the code you don't want to repeat.  Embedding an <strong>if</strong> statement in a loop which is always false except one time is kind of silly.</p>

<pre><code>def item_processing( item ):
    # *the common processing*

head_tail_iter = iter( someSequence )
head = head_tail_iter.next()
item_processing( head )
for item in head_tail_iter:
    # *the between processing*
    item_processing( item )
</code></pre>

<p>This is more reliable because it's slightly easier to prove,  It doesn't create an extra data structure (i.e., a copy of a list) and doesn't require a lot of wasted execution of an <strong>if</strong> condition which is always false except once.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If you're simply looking to modify the last element in <code>data_list</code> then you can simply use the notation:</p>

<pre><code>L[-1]
</code></pre>

<p>However, it looks like you're doing more than that. There is nothing really wrong with your way. I even took a quick glance at some <a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/browser/django/trunk/django/template/defaulttags.py" rel="nofollow">Django code</a> for their template tags and they do basically what you're doing.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>This is similar to Ants Aasma's approach but without using the itertools module. It's also a lagging iterator which looks-ahead a single element in the iterator stream:</p>

<pre><code>def last_iter(it):
    # Ensure it's an iterator and get the first field
    it = iter(it)
    prev = next(it)
    for item in it:
        # Lag by one item so I know I'm not at the end
        yield 0, prev
        prev = item
    # Last item
    yield 1, prev

def test(data):
    result = list(last_iter(data))
    if not result:
        return
    if len(result) &gt; 1:
        assert set(x[0] for x in result[:-1]) == set([0]), result
    assert result[-1][0] == 1

test([])
test([1])
test([1, 2])
test(range(5))
test(xrange(4))

for is_last, item in last_iter("Hi!"):
    print is_last, item
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Is there no possibility to iterate over all-but the last element, and treat the last one outside of the loop?  After all, a loop is created to do something similar to all elements you loop over; if one element needs something special, it shouldn't be in the loop.</p>

<p>(see also this question: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/156650/does-the-last-element-in-a-loop-deserve-a-separate-treatment">does-the-last-element-in-a-loop-deserve-a-separate-treatment</a>)</p>

<p>EDIT: since the question is more about the "in between", either the <em>first</em> element is the special one in that it has no predecessor, or the <em>last</em> element is special in that it has no successor.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You can use a sliding window over the input data to get a peek at the next value and use a sentinel to detect the last value. This works on any iterable, so you don't need to know the length beforehand. The pairwise implementation is from <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/itertools.html" rel="nofollow">itertools recipes</a>.</p>

<pre><code>from itertools import tee, izip, chain

def pairwise(seq):
    a,b = tee(seq)
    next(b, None)
    return izip(a,b)

def annotated_last(seq):
    """Returns an iterable of pairs of input item and a boolean that show if
    the current item is the last item in the sequence."""
    MISSING = object()
    for current_item, next_item in pairwise(chain(seq, [MISSING])):
        yield current_item, next_item is MISSING:

for item, is_last_item in annotated_last(data_list):
    if is_last_item:
        # current item is the last item
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>There is nothing wrong with your way, unless you will have 100 000 loops and wants save 100 000 "if" statements. In that case, you can go that way :</p>

<pre><code>iterable = [1,2,3] # Your date
iterator = iter(iterable) # get the data iterator

try :   # wrap all in a try / except
    while 1 : 
        item = iterator.next() 
        print item # put the "for loop" code here
except StopIteration, e : # make the process on the last element here
    print item
</code></pre>

<p>Outputs :</p>

<pre><code>1
2
3
3
</code></pre>

<p>But really, in your case I feel like it's overkill.</p>

<p>In any case, you will probably be luckier with slicing :</p>

<pre><code>for item in iterable[:-1] :
    print item
print "last :", iterable[-1]

#outputs
1
2
last : 3
</code></pre>

<p>or just :</p>

<pre><code>for item in iterable :
    print item
print iterable[-1]

#outputs
1
2
3
last : 3
</code></pre>

<p>Eventually, a KISS way to do you stuff, and that would work with any iterable, including the ones without <code>__len__</code> :</p>

<pre><code>item = ''
for item in iterable :
    print item
print item
</code></pre>

<p>Ouputs:</p>

<pre><code>1
2
3
3
</code></pre>

<p>If feel like I would do it that way, seems simple to me.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Assuming input as an iterator, here's a way using tee and izip from itertools:</p>

<pre><code>from itertools import tee, izip
items, between = tee(input_iterator, 2)  # Input must be an iterator.
first = items.next()
do_to_every_item(first)  # All "do to every" operations done to first item go here.
for i, b in izip(items, between):
    do_between_items(b)  # All "between" operations go here.
    do_to_every_item(i)  # All "do to every" operations go here.
</code></pre>

<p>Demo:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def do_every(x): print "E", x
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; def do_between(x): print "B", x
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; test_input = iter(range(5))
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; from itertools import tee, izip
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; items, between = tee(test_input, 2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; first = items.next()
&gt;&gt;&gt; do_every(first)
E 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; for i,b in izip(items, between):
...     do_between(b)
...     do_every(i)
...
B 0
E 1
B 1
E 2
B 2
E 3
B 3
E 4
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
