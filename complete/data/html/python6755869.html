<h3>Question (ID-6755869):</h3><h2>Yield in a recursive function</h2><p>I am trying to do something to all the files under a given path. I don't want to collect all the file names beforehand then do something with them, so I tried this:</p>

<pre><code>import os
import stat

def explore(p):
  s = ''
  list = os.listdir(p)
  for a in list:
    path = p + '/' + a
    stat_info = os.lstat(path )
    if stat.S_ISDIR(stat_info.st_mode):
     explore(path)
    else:
      yield path

if __name__ == "__main__":
  for x in explore('.'):
    print '--&gt;', x
</code></pre>

<p>But this code skips over directories when it hits them, instead of yielding their contents. What am I doing wrong?</p>

<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>explore(path)
</code></pre>

<p>with something like</p>

<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>for value in explore(path):
    yield value
</code></pre>

<p>Python 3.3 will add the syntax <code>yield from X</code>, as proposed in <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0380/">PEP 380</a>, to serve this purpose. You will be able to do this instead:</p>

<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>yield from explore(path)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/os.html#os.walk"><code>os.walk</code></a> instead of reinventing the wheel. </p>

<p>In particular, following the examples in the library documentation, here is an untested attempt:</p>

<pre><code>import os
from os.path import join

def hellothere(somepath):
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(somepath):
        for curfile in files:
            yield join(root, curfile)


# call and get full list of results:
allfiles = [ x for x in hellothere("...") ]

# iterate over results lazily:
for x in hellothere("..."):
    print x
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>The problem is this line of code:</p>

<pre><code>explore(path)
</code></pre>

<p>What does it do?</p>

<ul>
<li>calls <code>explore</code> with the new <code>path</code></li>
<li><code>explore</code> runs, creating a generator</li>
<li>the generator is return to the spot where <code>explore(path)</code> was executed <strong>. . .</strong></li>
<li>and is discarded</li>
</ul>

<p>Why is it discarded?  It wasn't assigned to anything, it wasn't iterated over -- it was completely ignored.</p>

<p>If you want to do something with the results, well, you have to do something with them!  ;)</p>

<p>The easiest way to fix your code is:</p>

<pre><code>for name in explore(path):
    yield name
</code></pre>

<p>When you are confident you understand what's going on, you'll probably want to use <code>os.walk()</code> instead.</p>

<p>Once you have migrated to Python 3.3 (assuming all works out as planned) you will be able to use the new <code>yield from</code> syntax and the easiest way to fix your code at that point will be:</p>

<pre><code>yield from explore(path)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Change this:</p>

<pre><code>explore(path)
</code></pre>

<p>To this:</p>

<pre><code>for subpath in explore(path):
    yield subpath
</code></pre>

<p>Or use <code>os.walk</code>, as phooji suggested (which is the better option).</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Try this:</p>

<pre><code>if stat.S_ISDIR(stat_info.st_mode):
    for p in explore(path):
        yield p
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>That calls <code>explore</code> like a function. What you should do is iterate it like a generator:</p>

<pre><code>if stat.S_ISDIR(stat_info.st_mode):
  for p in explore(path):
    yield p
else:
  yield path
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: Instead of the <code>stat</code> module, you could use <code>os.path.isdir(path)</code>.</p>
