<h3>Question (ID-2762623):</h3><h2>Python: cleaner list comprehension</h2><p>Is there a cleaner way to write this:</p>

<pre><code>for w in [w for w in words if w != '']:
</code></pre>

<p>I want to loop over a dictionary <code>words</code>, but only words that <code>!= ''</code>. Thanks!</p>

<pre><code>for w in words:
    if w != '':
        # ...
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Assuming that you are after the keys, why not try:</p>

<pre><code>[w for w in words if w]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><code>filter(lambda w: w != '', words)</code> or <code>filter(None, words)</code></p>

<p>this is suggestion, it may not be the best solution for your problem.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Testing that an element does not equal <code>''</code> isn't going to filter out whitespace elements. If that's what you're after, you probably want to use <code>str.isspace</code> (or a regular expression).</p>

<p>If you use a list comprehension, you'll make an extra copy of the list as an intermediary object. Probably not a big deal, but a generator won't use the extra memory.</p>

<p>I'd do it like this, with a generator:</p>

<pre><code>for word in (w for w in words if not w.isspace()):
    # do stuff
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I think your solution is sub optimal. You're iterating over the list <code>words</code> twice - once in the list comprehension to create the non-null terms and again in the loop to do the processing. It would be better if you used a genexp like so.</p>

<pre><code>for w in (x for x in words if x): process(w)
</code></pre>

<p>That way, the genexp will lazily return a list of non-nulls.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>What does the body of the outer for loop do?</p>

<p>If it's a function call you could potentially just do:</p>

<p><code>[f(w) for w in words if w != '']</code></p>
