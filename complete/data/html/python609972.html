<h3>Question (ID-609972):</h3><h2>Boolean 'and' in Python</h2><p>In C# we can do this:</p>

<pre><code>		int i = 5;
		int ii = 10;
		if(i == 5 &amp;&amp; ii == 10) {
			Console.WriteLine("i is 5, and ii is 10");

		}
		Console.ReadKey(true);
</code></pre>

<p>I tested this in Python:</p>

<pre><code>                 i = 5
                 ii = 10
                 if i == 5 &amp; ii == 10:
                          print "i is 5 and ii is 10";
</code></pre>

<p>But this doesn't print out "i is 5 and ii is 10".</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Try this:</p>

<pre><code>i = 5
ii = 10
if i == 5 and ii == 10:
      print "i is 5 and ii is 10"
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Oh, and you dont need that semicolon on the last line (edit to remove it from my code).</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>As pointed out, "&amp;" in python performs a bitwise and operation, just as it does in C#. <code>and</code> is the appropriate equivalent to the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> operator.</p>

<p>Since we're dealing with booleans (<code>i == 5</code> is <code>True</code> and <code>ii == 10</code> is also <code>True</code>), you may wonder why this didn't either work anyway (True being treated as an integer quantity should still mean True &amp; True is a True value), or throw an exception (eg. by forbidding bitwise operations on boolean types)</p>

<p>The reason is operator precedence.  The "<code>and</code>" operator binds more loosely than <code>==</code>, so the expression:    "<code>i==5 and ii==10</code>" is equivalent to: "<code>(i==5) and (ii==10)</code>"</p>

<p>However, bitwise <code>&amp;</code> has a higher precedence than "<code>==</code>" (since you wouldn't want expressions like "<code>a &amp; 0xff == ch</code>" to mean "<code>a &amp; (0xff == ch)</code>"), so the expression would actually be interpreted as:</p>

<pre><code>if i == (5 &amp; ii) == 10:
</code></pre>

<p>Which is using python's operator chaining to mean: does the valuee of ii anded with 5 equal both i and 10.  Obviously this will never be true.</p>

<p>You would actually get (seemingly) the right answer if you had included brackets to force the precedence, so:</p>

<pre><code>if (i==5) &amp; (ii=10)
</code></pre>

<p>would cause the statement to be printed.  It's the wrong thing to do, however - "<code>&amp;</code>" has many different semantics to "<code>and</code>" - (precedence, short-cirtuiting, behaviour with integer arguments etc), so it's fortunate that you caught this here rather than being fooled till it produced less obvious bugs.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>The correct operator to be used are the keywords 'or' and 'and', which in your example, the correct way to express this would be:</p>

<pre><code>if i == 5 and ii == 10:
    print "i is 5 and ii is 10"
</code></pre>

<p>You can refer the details in the <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/expressions.html#boolean-operations" rel="nofollow">"Boolean Operations" section in the language reference</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You can also test them as a couple.</p>

<pre><code>if (i,ii)==(5,10):
    print "i is 5 and ii is 10"
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p><code>&amp;</code> is used for bit-wise comparison. use <code>and</code> instead. and btw, you don't need semicolon at the end of print statement.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>In python, we spell "&amp;" as "and"</p>
