<h3>Question (ID-6626351):</h3><h2>How to extract bits from return code number in Bash</h2><p>I am using pylint utility that returns this error codes:</p>

<pre><code>Pylint should leave with following status code:

* 0 if everything went fine
* 1 if a fatal message was issued
* 2 if an error message was issued
* 4 if a warning message was issued
* 8 if a refactor message was issued
* 16 if a convention message was issued
* 32 on usage error

status 1 to 16 will be bit-ORed so you can know which different
categories has been issued by analysing pylint output status code
</code></pre>

<p>Now I need to determine if fatal or error message occured in Bash. How to do that? I guess I need bit operations for that ;-)</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I know I need to do bitwise and with number three (3) and test against null to see if fatal message or error message were issued. My problem is simple: <strong>bash syntax to do it</strong>. Input is $?, ouptut is again $? (e.g. using test program). Thanks!</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Bash supports bitwise <a href="http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/ops.html" rel="nofollow">operators</a>...</p>

<pre><code>$ let "x = 5&gt;&gt;1"
$ echo $x
2
$ let "x = 5 &amp; 4"
$ echo $x
4
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>A fatal message will be issued iff the status is odd, iff it has a 1 in the least significant digit.</p>

<p>An error message will be issued iff the status has a 1 in the next most significant digit.</p>

<p>So you want to check whether the last two digits are both 1; in other words, to check whether the bitwise <code>and</code> of your status code with <code>0b11</code> is three.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>The return code of the last executed command in bash is available as <code>$?</code>.</p>

<pre><code>[/tmp] % touch bar
[/tmp] % ls /tmp/bar 
/tmp/bar
[/tmp] % echo $?
0
[/tmp] % ls /tmp/baaz
ls: /tmp/baaz: No such file or directory
[/tmp] % echo $?
1
[/tmp] % 
</code></pre>

<p>If you were to call an external command from say python's <code>subprocess</code> module, you could get the return code of the external command from the Popen object once the subprocess has exited.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Got it!</p>

<pre><code>[ $(($NUMBER &amp; 3)) -ne 0 ] &amp;&amp; echo Fatal error or error was issued
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks!</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>in Bash you can use double parenthesis:</p>

<pre><code>#fatal error
returncode=7
(( res = errorcode &amp; 3 ))
[[ $res != 0 ]] &amp;&amp; echo "Fatal Error"
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Using (probably sub-optimally) the bash arithmetic stuff:</p>

<pre><code>for status in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16
do
    if [ $status = 0 ]
    then echo $status: it worked perfectly
    elsif [ $(( $status &amp; 3 )) != 0 ]
    then echo $status: a fatal or error message was sent
    else echo $status: it sort of worked mostly
    fi
done
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>0: it worked perfectly
1: a fatal or error message was sent
2: a fatal or error message was sent
3: a fatal or error message was sent
4: it sort of worked mostly
5: a fatal or error message was sent
6: a fatal or error message was sent
7: a fatal or error message was sent
8: it sort of worked mostly
9: a fatal or error message was sent
10: a fatal or error message was sent
11: a fatal or error message was sent
12: it sort of worked mostly
13: a fatal or error message was sent
14: a fatal or error message was sent
15: a fatal or error message was sent
16: it sort of worked mostly
</code></pre>

<p>I strongly suspect that the scripting (testing) can be made tighter or cleaner (specifically in the <code>elif</code> clause), but this seems to work (and I need to get to work).</p>

<pre><code>pylint ...
status=$?     # Catch exit status before it changes
if [ $status = 0 ]
then echo $status: it worked perfectly
elsif [ $(( $status &amp; 3 )) != 0 ]
then echo $status: a fatal or error message was sent
else echo $status: it sort of worked mostly
fi
</code></pre>
