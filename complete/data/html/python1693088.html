<h3>Question (ID-1693088):</h3><h2>What is the use of Python's basic optimizations mode? (`python -O`)</h2><p>Python has a flag <code>-O</code> that you can execute the interpreter with. The option will generate "optimized" bytecode (written to .pyo files), and given twice, it will discard docstrings. From Python's man page:</p>

<pre><code>   -O     Turn on basic optimizations.  This changes the  filename  exten‚Äê
          sion  for  compiled  (bytecode)  files from .pyc to .pyo.  Given
          twice, causes docstrings to be discarded.
</code></pre>

<p>This option's two major features as I see it are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Strip all assert statements. This trades defense against corrupt program state for speed. But don't you need a ton of assert statements for this to make a difference? Do you have any code where this is worthwhile (and sane?)</p></li>
<li><p>Strip all docstrings. In what application is the memory usage so critical, that this is a win? Why not push everything into modules written in C?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>What is the use of this option?
Does it have a real-world value?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>On stripping assert statements: this is a standard option in the C world, where many people believe part of the definition of ASSERT is that it doesn't run in production code.  Whether stripping them out or not makes a difference depends less on how many asserts there are than on how much work those asserts do:</p>

<pre><code>def foo(x):
    assert x in huge_global_computation_to_check_all_possible_x_values()
    # ok, go ahead and use x...
</code></pre>

<p>Most asserts are not like that, of course, but it's important to remember that you can do stuff like that.</p>

<p>As for stripping docstrings, it does seem like a quaint holdover from a simpler time, though I guess there are memory-constrained environments where it could make a difference.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Another use for the <code>-O</code> flag is that the value of the <code>__debug__</code> builtin variable is set to <code>False</code>.</p>

<p>So, basically, your code can have a lot of "debugging" paths like:</p>

<pre><code>if __debug__:
     # output all your favourite debugging information
     # and then more
</code></pre>

<p>which, when running under <code>-O</code>, won't even be included as bytecode in the <code>.pyo</code> file; a poor man's C-ish #ifdef.</p>

<p>Remember that docstrings are being dropped <em>only</em> when the flag is <code>-OO</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You've pretty much figured it out: It does practically nothing at all. You're almost never going to see speed or memory gains, unless you're severely hurting for RAM.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I have never encountered a good reason to use <code>-O</code>. I have always assumed its main purpose is in case at some point in the future some meaningful optimization is added.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I imagine that the heaviest users of <code>-O</code> are <a href="http://www.py2exe.org/" rel="nofollow">py2exe</a> <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/py2app/" rel="nofollow">py2app</a> and similar.</p>

<p>I've personally never found a use for <code>-O</code> directly.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>If you have assertions in frequently called code (e.g. in an inner loop), stripping them can certainly make a difference. Extreme example:</p>

<pre><code>$ python    -c 'import timeit;print timeit.repeat("assert True")'
[0.088717937469482422, 0.088625192642211914, 0.088654994964599609]
$ python -O -c 'import timeit;print timeit.repeat("assert True")'
[0.029736995697021484, 0.029587030410766602, 0.029623985290527344]
</code></pre>

<p>In real scenarios, savings will usually be much less.</p>

<p>Stripping the docstrings might reduce the size of your code, and hence your working set.</p>

<p>In many cases, the performance impact will be negligible, but as always with optimizations, the only way to be sure is to measure. </p>
