<p>From the site:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are many deployment options for
  Python code. I'll share what has
  worked well for me on Windows,
  packaging command line tools and
  services using py2exe and InnoSetup.
  I'll demonstrate a simple build script
  which creates windows binaries and an
  InnoSetup installer in one step. In
  addition, I'll go over common errors
  which come up when using py2exe and
  hints on troubleshooting them. This is
  a short talk, so there will be a
  follow-up Open Space session to share
  experience and help each other solve
  distribution problems.</p>
