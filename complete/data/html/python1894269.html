<h3>Question (ID-1894269):</h3><h2>convert string list to list in python</h2><p>I was wondering what the simplest way to convert a string list like</p>

<p>x =u'[ "A","B","C" , " D"]'
                       -in case user puts spaces in between the commas , and spaces inside of the quotes . I need to handle that as well</p>

<p>to</p>

<p>x = ["A","B","C","D"] </p>

<p>in python.</p>

<p>I know I can strip spaces with strip and split using the split operator and check for non alphabets . But the code was getting very kludgy. Is there a quick function I dont know of</p>

&gt;&gt;&gt; x = u'[ "A","B","C" , " D"]'
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = ast.literal_eval(x)
&gt;&gt;&gt; x
['A', 'B', 'C', ' D']
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = [n.strip() for n in x]
&gt;&gt;&gt; x
['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://docs.python.org/library/ast.html#ast.literal%5Feval" rel="nofollow">ast.literal_eval</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Safely evaluate an expression node or a string containing a Python expression. The string or node provided may only consist of the following Python literal structures: strings, numbers, tuples, lists, dicts, booleans, and None.</p>
</blockquote>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The <code>eval</code> is dangerous - you shouldn't execute user input.</p>

<p>If you have 2.6 or newer, use ast instead of eval:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import ast
&gt;&gt;&gt; ast.literal_eval('["A","B" ,"C" ," D"]')
["A", "B", "C", " D"]
</code></pre>

<p>Once you have that, <code>strip</code> the strings.</p>

<p>If you're on an older version of Python, you can get very close to what you want with a simple regular expression:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x='[  "A",  " B", "C","D "]'
&gt;&gt;&gt; re.findall(r'"\s*([^"]*?)\s*"', x)
['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
</code></pre>

<p>This isn't as good as the ast solution, for example it doesn't correctly handle escaped quotes in strings. But it's simple, doesn't involve a dangerous eval, and might be good enough for your purpose if you're on an older Python without ast.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><pre><code>import ast
l = ast.literal_eval('[ "A","B","C" , " D"]')
l = [i.strip() for i in l]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>There is a quick solution:</p>

<pre><code>x = eval('[ "A","B","C" , " D"]')
</code></pre>

<p>Unwanted whitespaces in the list elements may be removed in this way:</p>

<pre><code>x = [x.strip() for x in eval('[ "A","B","C" , " D"]')]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>If you know that your lists only contain quoted strings, this pyparsing example will give you your list of stripped strings (even preserving the original Unicode-ness).</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from pyparsing import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; x =u'[ "A","B","C" , " D"]'
&gt;&gt;&gt; LBR,RBR = map(Suppress,"[]")
&gt;&gt;&gt; qs = quotedString.setParseAction(removeQuotes, lambda t: t[0].strip())
&gt;&gt;&gt; qsList = LBR + delimitedList(qs) + RBR
&gt;&gt;&gt; print qsList.parseString(x).asList()
[u'A', u'B', u'C', u'D']
</code></pre>

<p>If your lists can have more datatypes, or even contain lists within lists, then you will need a more complete grammar - like <a href="http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/file/view/parsePythonValue.py" rel="nofollow">this one</a> on the pyparsing wiki, which will handle tuples, lists, ints, floats, and quoted strings.  Will work with Python versions back to 2.4.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Assuming that all your inputs are lists and that the double quotes in the input actually don't matter, this can be done with a simple regexp replace.  It is a bit perl-y but works like a charm.  Note also that the output is now a list of unicode strings, you didn't specify that you needed that, but it seems to make sense given unicode input.</p>

<pre><code>import re
x = u'[ "A","B","C" , " D"]'
junkers = re.compile('[[" \]]')
result = junkers.sub('', x).split(',')
print result
---&gt;  [u'A', u'B', u'C', u'D']
</code></pre>

<p>The junkers variable contains a compiled regexp (for speed) of all characters we don't want, using ] as a character required some backslash trickery.
The re.sub replaces all these characters with nothing, and we split the resulting string at the commas.   </p>

<p>Note that this also removes spaces from inside entries u'["oh no"]' ---> [u'ohno'].  If this is not what you wanted, the regexp needs to be souped up a bit.  </p>
