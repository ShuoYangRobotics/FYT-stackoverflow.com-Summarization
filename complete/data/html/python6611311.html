<h3>Question (ID-6611311):</h3><h2>Running a .py file in browser</h2><p>I want to run python file in browser.
I have installed apache. and configured <code>httd.conf</code> file.
I have created <code>test.py</code>file.
I then tried running <code>test.py</code> with my browser by typing <code>htt://localhost/test.py</code>. When I do this, I get the following error:</p>

<p>What could be the problem here?</p>

ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "C:/Program Files/Apache Software Foundation/Apache2.2/cgi-bin/"</p>

<p>It's what I have and it works</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>If you haven't done this already, you need to set the proper permissions on <code>test.py</code> to 755.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If it's a CGI program, make sure it conforms to the CGI specification (i.e. it outputs a header line with the MIME type and a blank line before trying to write anything else)</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Is the file in C:/Program Files (x86)/Apache Software Foundation/Apache2.2/htdocs/ as the error message states.  If not you need to put it there or change your configuration so that it looks in the right location.</p>

<p>Also, as other answers, check that it has the correct permissions and check that it outputs all the necessary headers.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I would change your url to a more likely one in the first instance, ie <code>http://localhost/test.py</code> rather than the one you quoted (<code>htt://localhost/test.py</code>) </p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>you can try mod_python,it supports web applications written in python.the parser gets embedded in the server as an apache module so app runs faster than traditional cgi.
Also if you want to stick to cgi way,confirm that all the .py files are in folder named "cgi-bin" and have executable rights.</p>
