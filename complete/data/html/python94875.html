<h3>Question (ID-94875):</h3><h2>Image Processing, In Python?</h2><p>I've recently come across a problem which requires at least a basic degree of image processing, can I do this in Python, and if so, with what?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-9):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The best-known library is <a href="http://effbot.org/zone/pil-index.htm" rel="nofollow">PIL</a>.  However if you are simply doing basic manipulation, you are probably better off with the Python bindings for <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/ImageMagick" rel="nofollow">ImageMagick</a>, which will be a good deal more efficient than writing the transforms in Python.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You also have an approach to image processing based on "standard" scientific modules: <strong>SciPy</strong> has a whole package dedicated to image processing: <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/ndimage.html" rel="nofollow">scipy.ndimage</a>.  Scipy is in effect the standard general numerical calculations package; it is based on the de facto standard array-manipulation module <a href="http://numpy.org/" rel="nofollow">NumPy</a>: images can also be manipulated as array of numbers.  As for image display, <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/gallery.html" rel="nofollow">Matplotlib</a> (also part of the "science trilogy") makes displaying images <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/examples/pylab_examples/image_demo3.html" rel="nofollow">quite simple</a>.</p>

<p>SciPy is still actively maintained, so it's a good investment for the future.  Furthermore, SciPy currently runs with Python 3 too, while the Python Imaging Library (PIL) does not.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Depending on what you mean by "image processing", a better choice might be in the numpy based libraries: <a href="http://luispedro.org/software/mahotas" rel="nofollow">mahotas</a>, <a href="http://scikits.appspot.com/image" rel="nofollow">scikits.image</a>, or <a href="http://www.scipy.org/SciPyPackages/Ndimage" rel="nofollow">scipy.ndimage</a>. All of these work based on numpy arrays, so you can mix and match functions from one library and another.</p>

<p>I started the website <a href="http://pythonvision.org" rel="nofollow">http://pythonvision.org</a> which has more information on these.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>There is actually a wonderful <a href="http://effbot.org/zone/pil-index.htm" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow">Python Imaging Library (PIL)</a>.  It gives you the ability to alter existing images, including anti-aliasing capabilities, and create new images with text and such.  You can also find a <a href="http://effbot.org/imagingbook/introduction.htm" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow">decent introductory tutorial</a> in the PIL handbook provided on the aforementioned site.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>There's also <a href="http://www.cairographics.org/pycairo/" rel="nofollow">pycairo</a>, which might be more suitable depending on your needs.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>If you are creating a custom image processing effect, you may find PythonPixels useful.

It is intended for writing and experimenting with image processing.</p>

<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>I have done some basic image processing in PIL. You can check it out on my blog</p>

<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>VIPS should be fast and uses multiple CPUs:
