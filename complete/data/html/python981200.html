<h3>Question (ID-981200):</h3><h2>Can Windows drivers be written in Python?</h2><p>All in the title :)</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Yes. You cannot create the "classic" kernel-mode drivers. However, starting with XP, Windows offers a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/driver/wdf/UMDF.mspx" rel="nofollow">User-Mode Driver Framework</a>. They can't do everything, obviously - any driver used in booting the OS obviously has to be kernel-mode. But with UMDF, you only need to implement COM components. </p>

<p>Besides boot-time drivers, you also can't write UMDF drivers that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Handle interrupts</li>
<li>Directly access hardware, such as direct memory access (DMA)</li>
<li>have strict timing loops</li>
<li>Use nonpaged pool or other resources that are reserved for kernel mode</li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The definitive answer is not without embedding an interpreter in your otherwise C/assembly driver. Unless someone has a framework available, then the answer is no. Once you have the interpreter and bindings in place then the rest of the logic could be done in Python.</p>

<p>However, writing drivers is one of the things for which C is best suited. I imagine the resulting Python code would look a whole lot like C code and defeat the purpose of the interpreter overhead.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>A good way to gain insight why this is practically impossible is by reading <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/driver/kernel/KMcode.mspx" rel="nofollow">Microsoft's advice</a> on the use of C++ in drivers. As a derivative of C, the use of C++ appears to be straightforward. In practice, not so. </p>

<p>For instance, you must decide for every function (and really every assembly instruction) whether it's in pageable or non-pageable memory. This requires extensions to C, careful use of new C++ features, or in this case a special extension to the Python language and VM. In addition, your driver-compatible VM would also have to deal with the different IRQLs - there's a hierarchy of "levels" which restrict what you can and cannot do. </p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Python runs in a virtual machine, so no.</p>

<p>BUT:</p>

<p>You could write a compiler that translates Python code to machine language.  Once you've done that, you can do it.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I don't know the restrictions on drivers on windows (memory allocation schemes, dynamic load of libraries and all), but you may be able to embed a python interpreter in your driver, at which point you can do whatever you want. Not that I think it is a good idea :)</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Never say never but eh.. no</p>

<p>You might be able to hack something together to run user-mode parts of drivers in python. But kernel-mode stuff can only be done in C or assembly.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>No they cannot.  Windows drivers must be written in a language that can </p>

<ol>
<li>Interface with the C based API</li>
<li>Compile down to machine code </li>
</ol>

<p>Then again, there's nothing stopping you from writing a compiler that translates python to machine code ;)</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Yes you can :)
Just you need know deeper python and C 
you can do anything with python</p>
