<h3>Question (ID-1514553):</h3><h2>how to declare an array in python?</h2><p>I'm really new to python and I'm wondering how to declare an array in this language? I can't find any reference to arrays in the docs. </p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><pre><code>variable = []
</code></pre>

<p>Now <code>variable</code> refers to an empty list (array).</p>

<p>Of course this is an assignment, not a declaration. There's no way to say in python "this variable should never refer to anything other than an array", since python is dynamically typed.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You don't declare anything in Python. You just use it. I recommend you start out with something like <a href="http://diveintopython.org" rel="nofollow">http://diveintopython.org</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You don't actually declare things, but this is how you create an array in Python:</p>

<pre><code>from array import array
intarray = array('i')
</code></pre>

<p>For more info see the array module: <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/array.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/library/array.html</a></p>

<p>Now possible you don't want an array, but a list, but others have answered that already. :)</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I would normally just do <code>a = [1,2,3]</code> which is actually a <code>list</code> but for <code>arrays</code> look at this formal <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/array.html" rel="nofollow">definition</a></p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>my_array = [1, 'rebecca', 'allard', 15]</p>

<p>as a sample.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Following on from Lennart, there's also <a href="http://numpy.scipy.org/" rel="nofollow">numpy</a> which implements homogeneous multi-dimensional arrays.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I think you (meant)want an list with the first 30 cells already filled.
So</p>

<pre><code>   f = []

   for i in range(30):
       f.append(0)
</code></pre>

<p>An example to where this could be used is in Fibonacci sequence.
See problem 2 in <a href="http://projecteuler.net/" rel="nofollow">Project Euler</a></p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>for calculations, use <a href="http://numpy.scipy.org/" rel="nofollow">numpy</a> arrays like this:</p>

<pre><code>import numpy as np

a = np.ones((3,2))        # a 2D array with 3 rows, 2 columns, filled with ones
b = np.array([1,2,3])     # a 1D array initialised using a list [1,2,3]
c = np.linspace(2,3,100)  # an array with 100 points beteen (and including) 2 and 3

print(a*1.5)  # all elements of a times 1.5
print(a.T+b)  # b added to the transpose of a
</code></pre>

<p>these numpy arrays can be saved and loaded from disk (even compressed) and complex calculations with large amounts of elements is C-like fast. Much used in scientific environments. See <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.6.0/user/whatisnumpy.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> for more...</p>
