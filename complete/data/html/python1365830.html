<h3>Question (ID-1365830):</h3><h2>.NET developer moving to ubuntu for development</h2><p>I've been developing in .NET now for about 3 years. I love the visual studio IDE and sadly I won't be able to use it anymore.</p>

<p>Could someone save me hours of searching the web and reading reviews, and suggest the 'standard' or most popular IDE/Text editor for linux that will get me up and running quickly?</p>

<p>My main goals here are web development backed with Python.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Consider <a href="http://www.wingware.com/doc/howtos/django" rel="nofollow">Wing IDE</a> -- IMHO the best commercial IDE for Python, it does support Django if that's what you want (as, apparently, do 80% of Python-based websites; personally, I prefer <a href="http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/" rel="nofollow">werkzeug</a> and the like, but maybe that's partly because my "web apps" tend to be more like "web services", with most all the UI/views parts done in HTML/CSS/Dojo;-).</p>

<p>Me, I use <a href="http://www.sontek.net/post/Python-with-a-modular-IDE-%28Vim%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">Vim</a> (usually in the gvim incarnation) as my "Python IDE" (and I've seen Emacs-using colleagues do at-least-equivalent wizardry, but I just can't get used to Emacs myself!-)... but I have to admit that a Wing IDE expect, particularly if faced with a thorny debug scenario, can do circles around me (and even around the Emacsers).  ((So why haven't I made the effort to switch? Maybe because, thanks to fanatical testing, I now face thorny debug scenarios too rarely to make me an expert in any new tool!-))  ((Or maybe because my fingers, having learned vi 30+ years ago, would HATE me if I switched to ANYTHING else;-)).</p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/81584/what-ide-to-use-for-python">this</a> question about Python IDEs.</p>

<p>I use Eclipse + PyDev.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>First off, if you want to do web with Python, the <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/" rel="nofollow">Django</a> framework seems like the best choice.</p>

<p>From some quick Googling, the best IDE for Django would be <a href="http://kubasik.net/blog/2009/03/12/finally-a-django-ide-with-real-code-completion-and-template-support/" rel="nofollow">NetBeans with a plugin</a>.</p>

<p>Good luck on learning 'nix development, then!</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I really like gedit and a terminal. You'll more than likely need to make a few <a href="http://grigio.org/textmate%5Fgedit%5Ffew%5Fsteps" rel="nofollow">tweaks</a> and maybe install a plugin or two. gedit also has a Python console window plugin if you like that kind of integration. (Edit -> Preferences -> Plugins, then enable the bottom pane with View -> Bottom Pane)</p>

<p>If you're new to Ubuntu I'd still recommend trying a few different tools before you get settled. The impression I get is that text editors are more commonplace than full blown IDEs on Linux. I tried a few IDEs on Ubuntu and it just didn't seem right - gedit is lightweight and I actually enjoy using it more than Textmate on OS X.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>If you are willing to pay Wing IDE (<a href="http://www.wingware.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wingware.com/</a>) is the best (IMO)
They have trial versions and a basic version free (<a href="https://wingware.com/wing101" rel="nofollow">https://wingware.com/wing101</a>)</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p><strong><a href="http://monodevelop.com/" rel="nofollow">Mono Develop</a></strong></p>

<p>If you've been using visual studio, then I'd guess that mono develop would be the closest thing.  As far as I know, its the best attempt around to be a linux version of visual studio.  A quick Google search gives several results for python plugins for mono develop.</p>
