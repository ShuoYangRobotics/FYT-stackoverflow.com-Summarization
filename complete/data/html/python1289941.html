<h3>Question (ID-1289941):</h3><h2>Web Application Frameworks: C++ vs Python</h2><p>I am familiar with both Python and C++ as a programmer. I was thinking of writing my own simple web application and I wanted to know which language would be more appropriate for server-side web development.</p>

<p>Some things I'm looking for:</p>

<ul>
<li>It has to be intuitive. I recognize that Wt exists and it follows the model of Qt. The one thing I hate about Qt is that they encourage strange syntax through obfuscated means (e.g. the "public slots:" idiom). If I'm going to write C++, I need it to be standard, recognizable, clean code. No fancy shmancy silliness that Qt provides.</li>
<li>The less non-C++ or Python code I have to write, the better. The thing about Django (Python web framework) is that it requires you pretty much write the HTML by hand. I think it would be great if HTML forms took more of a wxWidgets approach. Wt is close to this but follows the Qt model instead of wxWidgets.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm typically writing video games with C++ and I have no experience in web development. I want to write a nice web site for many reasons. I want it to be a learning experience, I want it to be fun, and I want to easily be able to concentrate on "fun stuff" (e.g. less boilerplate, more meat of the app).</p>

<p>Any tips for a newbie web developer? I'm guessing web app frameworks are the way to go, but it's just a matter of picking one.</p>

However, in my experience, using an intermediate framework to generate HTML and ECMAScript never works anywhere near as well as hand-writing the pages.</p>

<p>[edit] nikow mentions in the comments that <a href="http://pyjs.org/" rel="nofollow">Pyjamas</a> is a port of GWT to Python.</p>

<p>Regarding the language, if given the choice between C++ and Python I would pick Python 100% of the time. Even ignoring the obvious difference in abstraction between those languages, Python simply has more useful libraries than C++. You don't have to write your own development-oriented web server -- Django comes with one. You don't need to write a custom template library -- Python has <a href="http://genshi.edgewall.org/" rel="nofollow">Genshi</a>. Django comes with a capable ORM layer, or for even more control you can use <a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/" rel="nofollow">SQLAlchemy</a>. It's barely a contest.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><ul>
<li>Django is good point to start web development it is great framework</li>
<li>If you look for C++ take a look on <a href="http://cppcms.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">CppCMS</a>, it is much more close to Django, it is not like Wt that mimics Qt.</li>
</ul>

<p>In any case, it is really depends on your needs. C++ can be used for embedded or high performance web applications, but for medium range web sites Django would be better. (and I'm developer of CppCMS)</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I think you better go firt python in your case, meanwhile you can extend cppCMS functionalities and write your own framework arround it.</p>

<p>wt was a good idea design, but somehow not that suitable.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>If you are exploring Python frameworks (based on the excepted answer I think you are) I think you really owe it to yourself to check out <a href="http://cherrypy.org/" rel="nofollow">CherryPy</a>. When you write CherryPy apps, you really are just writing Python apps. The framework gets out of your way in a real hurry. Your free to choose your own templating, ORM (if you choose to use ORM), etc. Seriously, take 10 or 20 minutes and give it a look.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>The only reason you might want to use C++ over Python is when speed is paramount.</p>

<p>If this is going to be your first web-app, you'll probably be ok with just Python, and your development speed will be orders of magnitude better than with CPP.</p>

<p>Django's templating language is far from powerless, to me it actually seems very pythonic. You actually can write pure python in a template(although this is generally not recommended).</p>

<p>Even better, it's possible to replace Django's templating system with the one you like.
My personal favourite language for this is HAML.</p>

<p>Here's some data on this:

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Having looked several ones, like django, pylos, web2py, wt. My recommendation is web2py. It's a python version of "ruby on rails" and easy to learn. </p>
