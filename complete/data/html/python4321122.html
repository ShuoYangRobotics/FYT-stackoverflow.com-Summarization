<h3>Question (ID-4321122):</h3><h2>Why not python implicit line continuation on period?</h2><p>Is there any reason Python does not allow implicit line continuations after (or before) periods?  That is</p>

<pre><code>data.where(lambda d: e.name == 'Obama').
    count()


data.where(lambda d: e.name == 'Obama')
    .count()
</code></pre>

<p>Does this conflict with some feature of Python?  With the rise of method chaining APIs this seems like a nice feature.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Both of those situations can lead to valid, complete constructs, so continuing on them would complicate the parser.</p>

<pre><code>print 3.
  1415926

print 'Hello, world'
  .lower()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Python allow line continuations within parentheticals (), so you might try:</p>

<pre><code>(data.where(lambda d: e.name == 'Obama').
    count())
</code></pre>

<p>I know that's not answering your question ("why?"), but maybe it's helpful.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Not sure about after periods, but in your example the newline before a period leads to the first line being a valid statement on its own. Then Python would have to look ahead to the second line to know whether the first line was a statement or not.</p>

<p>One of the goals when defining the language syntax was to be able to parse it without having ambiguities that require looking ahead like that.</p>

<p>It'd get annoying in the interactive interpreter if you had to press enter twice after every single line just so Python knew you'd finished your statement and weren't going to put a <code>.foo()</code> after it.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Use a '\' at the end. (looks ugly though)</p>

<pre><code>data.where(lambda d: e.name == 'Obama').\
    count()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>In the cases where a period could be leading in to a method call, it will always(?) be a syntax error for it to just occur at the end of a line by itself.  So it would be unambiguous to read it as starting a continuation.</p>

<p>However, Python generally speaking doesn't continue a line just because there's an incomplete binary operator there.  For instance, the following is not valid:</p>

<pre><code>2 + 
    4
</code></pre>

<p>In the second example, the first line is valid by itself and it would be really inconsistent for Python to look for a following line "just in case" there is one.</p>

<p>I would just break after the opening paren of the method call.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>{Because python uses line breaks to end statements, not depending on braces or semi-colins;}</p>
