<h3>Question (ID-1963353):</h3><h2>short Unicode \N{} names for Latin-1 characters in Python?</h2><p>Are there short Unicode u"\N{...}" names for Latin1 characters in Python ?
\N{A umlaut} etc. would be nice,<br>
\N{LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH DIAERESIS} etc. is just too long to type every time.<br>
(Added:) I use an English keyboard, but occasionally need German letters, as in "Löwenbräu Weißbier".<br>
Yes one can cut-paste them singly, L cutpaste ö wenbr cutpaste ä ...
but that breaks the flow; I was hoping for a keyboard-only way.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Sorry, no, there's no such thing. In string literals, anyway... you could perhaps piggyback on another encoding scheme, such as HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import HTMLParser
&gt;&gt;&gt; HTMLParser.HTMLParser().unescape(u'a &amp;auml; b c')
u'a \xe4 b'
</code></pre>

<p>But I don't think this'd be worth it.</p>

<p>Hardly anyone even uses the <code>\N</code> notation in any case... for the occasional character the <code>\xnn</code> notation is acceptable; for more involved usage you're better off just typing <code>ä</code> directly and making sure a <code># coding=</code> is defined in the script as per <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/" rel="nofollow">PEP263</a>. (If you don't have a keyboard layout that can type those diacriticals directly, get one. eg. eurokb on Windows, or using the Compose key on Linux.)</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>If you want to do the right thing please <strong>use UTF-8 in your python source code</strong>. This will keep the code much more readable.</p>

<p>Python is able to real UTF-8 source files, all you have to do is to add an additional line after the first one:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python
# -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-
</code></pre>

<p>By the way, starting with Python 3.0 UTF-8 is the default encoding so you will not need this line anymore. See <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3120/" rel="nofollow">PEP3120</a></p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You can put an actual "ä" character in your string. For this you have to declare the encoding of the source code at the top</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
# encoding: utf-8

x = u"ä"
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Have you thought about writing your own converter? It wouldn't be hard to write something that would go through a file and replace \N{A umlaut} with \N{LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH DIAERESIS} and all the rest.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You can use the Unicode notation <code>\uXXXX</code> do describe that character:</p>

<pre><code>u"\u00E4"
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>On Windows, you can use the charmap.exe utility to look up the keyboard shortcut for common letters you're using such as:</p>

<pre><code>ALT-0223 = ß
ALT-0228 = ä
ALT-0246 = ö
</code></pre>

<p>Then use Unicode and save in UTF-8:</p>

<pre><code># -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-
phrase = u'Löwenbräu Weißbier'
</code></pre>

<p>or use a converter as someone else mentioned and make up your own shortcuts:</p>

<pre><code># -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-

def german(s):
    s = s.replace(u'SS',u'ß')
    s = s.replace(u'a:',u'ä')
    s = s.replace(u'o:',u'ö')
    return s

phrase = german(u'Lo:wenbra:u WeiSSbier')
print phrase
</code></pre>
