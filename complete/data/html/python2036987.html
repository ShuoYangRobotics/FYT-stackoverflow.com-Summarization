<h3>Question (ID-2036987):</h3><h2>Online IDE for Python</h2><p>Is there any web-based IDE that I can use to run quick tests? There're a dozen for PHP and some for even Java but I haven't found yet that runs Python. If there's an <strong>open-source IDE available that I can host and run myself</strong>, that'd be better.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><a href="http://codepad.org" rel="nofollow">Codepad</a> can compile code, if it's what you're looking for.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><a href="http://shell.appspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://shell.appspot.com/</a>  The google AppEngine shell (not really an IDE though).</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I'm pretty sure that IDE's are the last kind of programs that will ever go web based, because a good IDE needs to be so extremely interactive if it wants to be good.</p>

<p>I really don't see a reason for this and others seem to agree because there isn't any.
And no, an interactive web shell or compiler has nothing to do with an IDE. </p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I'm trying out PythonAnywhere.com and it has in-browser support for both 3.2 and 2.7.  It also lets you sync to dropbox and deploy right to the web.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Through not specifically for python <a href="http://codepad.org/" rel="nofollow">Codepad</a> is good too.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p><a href="https://bespin.mozilla.com/" rel="nofollow">Mozilla Bespin</a> is an interesting project (<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Bespin/UserGuide" rel="nofollow">user guide</a>).</p>

<p>It is a Mozilla labs open source project to build a browser-based IDE. You can host it yourself, see the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Bespin/DeveloperGuide" rel="nofollow">Bespin developer guide</a>.</p>

<p>I don't think it is currently a full-fledged Python IDE, but I believe it could be made into one with a bit of effort. The Bespin server is written in Python.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p><a href="http://ideone.com" rel="nofollow">ideone.com</a> is able to compile and run Python. There is also an integrated web editor - perfect for quick tests. It is not an open source but you can use Ideone API to build your service.</p>
