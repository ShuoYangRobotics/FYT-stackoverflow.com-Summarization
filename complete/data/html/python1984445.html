<h3>Question (ID-1984445):</h3><h2>Interaction between Java App and Python App</h2><p>I have a python application which I cant edit its a black box from my point of view. The python application knows how to process text and return processed text.
I have another application written in Java which knows how to collect non processed texts.</p>

<p>Current state, the python app works in batch mode every x minutes.</p>

<p>I want to make the python </p>

<p>processing part of the process: Java app collects text and request the python app to process and return processed text as part of a flow.</p>

<p>What do you think is the simplest solution for this?</p>

<p>Thanks,
Rod</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Look into <a href="http://www.jython.org/" rel="nofollow">Jython</a> - you can run Python programs directly from Java code, and interact seamlessly back and forth.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I don't know nothing about Jython and the like. I guess it's the best solution if you can execute two programs without executing a new process each time the Java app needs to transform text. Anyway a simple proof of concept is to execute a separate process from the Java App to make it work. Next you can enhance the execution with all that tools.</p>

<p><strong>Executing a separate process from Java</strong></p>

<pre><code>String[] envprops = new String[] {"PROP1=VAL1", "PROP2=VAL2" };
Process pythonProc = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(
   "the command to execute the python app", 
    envprops, 
    new File("/workingdirectory"));

// get an outputstream to write into the standard input of python
OutputStream toPython = pythonProc.getOutputStream();

// get an inputstream to read from the standard output of python
InputStream fromPython = pythonProc.getInputStream();

// send something
toPython.write(.....);
// receive something
fromPython.read(....);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Important: chars are NOT bytes</strong></p>

<p>A lot of people understimate this.</p>

<p>Be careful with char to byte conversions (remember Writers/Readers are for chars, Input/OutputStreams are for bytes, encoding is necesary for convertir one to another, you can use <code>OuputStreamWriter</code> to convert string to bytes and send, <code>InputStreamReader</code> to convert bytes to chars and read them).</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Use <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/ProcessBuilder.html" rel="nofollow">ProcessBuilder</a> to  execute your <a href="http://docs.python.org/" rel="nofollow">Python</a> code as a filter:</p>

<pre><code>import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class PBTest {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder("python", "-c", "print 42");
        pb.redirectErrorStream(true);
        try {
            Process p = pb.start();
            String s;
            BufferedReader stdout = new BufferedReader (
                new InputStreamReader(p.getInputStream()));
            while ((s = stdout.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(s);
            }
            System.out.println("Exit value: " + p.waitFor());
            p.getInputStream().close();
            p.getOutputStream().close();
            p.getErrorStream().close();
         } catch (Exception ex) {
            ex.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Expose one of the two as a service of some kind, web service maybe. Another option is to port the python code to Jython</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>One possible solution is <a href="http://jpype.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">jpype</a>.  This allows you to launch a JVM from Python and pass data back and forth between them.</p>

<p>Another solution may be to write the Python program as a filter (reading data from stdin and writing result to stdout) then run it as a pipe.  However I do not know how well Java supports this - according to the Sun docs their concept of pipes only supports communication between threads on the same JVM.  </p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>An option is making the python application work as a server, listens for request via sockets (TCP).</p>
