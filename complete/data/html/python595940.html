<h3>Question (ID-595940):</h3><h2>Seemingly completely random Python syntax errors</h2><p>Here's a small sample section of some code I'm writing with python and pygame, for some reason it seems to be claiming that some seemingly very simple and apparently accurate things are syntax errors. Here's possibly the most annoying example.</p>

<pre><code>def Draw():
    Surface.fill((255,255,255))
    for square in squares:
        pygame.draw.rect(Surface,(0,0,0),(square.x,square.y,height,height)

def main():
    while True:
        GetInput()
        Move()
        CollisionDetect()
        Draw()
</code></pre>

<p>for some reason the word def at the start of line 6 get higlighted red and marked as an error, any idea why would be incredibly helpful, thanks :) (any other code you need, just comment).</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Unbalanced parentheses on line 4.</p>

<p>You're missing a closing )</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Here's a quick tip for dealing with syntax errors: if the compiler or interpreter is complaining about a completely normal looking line, check the line just above it.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You missed one closing paranthesis:</p>

<pre><code>pygame.draw.rect(Surface,(0,0,0),(square.x,square.y,height,height)
</code></pre>

<p>There are three "(" parenthesis but only two ")"</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>It looks like you're missing a parenthesis on this line:
pygame.draw.rect(Surface,(0,0,0),(square.x,square.y,height,height)</p>

<p>edit: I would like to add that in the future it might help if you paste whatever syntax error the interpreter gave you in your question.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Say, did anybody mention that you're missing a parenthesis?  ;)</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Syntax errors in most languages happen AFTER the actual error, because the parser doesn't always KNOW something is wrong until it finds some later bit that can't be there.  The parser complains about the thing that can't be, rather than what you did wrong.</p>

<p>tl;dr: Always look for the syntax error from where the compiler complained and work backwards toward the start of the file.</p>
