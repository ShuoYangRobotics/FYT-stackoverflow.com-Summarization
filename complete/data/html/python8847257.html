<h3>Question (ID-8847257):</h3><h2>Algorithm to match 2 lists with wildcards</h2><p>I'm looking for an efficient way to match 2 lists, one wich contains complete information, and one which contains wildcards. I've been able to do this with wildcards of fixed lengths, but am now trying to do it with wildcards of variable lengths.</p>

<p>Thus:</p>

<pre><code>match( ['A', 'B', '*', 'D'], ['A', 'B', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'D'] )
</code></pre>

<p>would return True as long as all the elements are in the same order in both lists.</p>

<p>I'm working with lists of objects, but used strings above for simplicity. </p>

<p>It appears you are not using strings, but rather comparing objects. I am therefore giving an explicit algorithm â€” regular expressions provide a good solution tailored for strings, don't get me wrong, but from what you say as a comment to your questions, it seems an explicit, simple algorithm may make things easier for you.</p>

<p>It turns out that this can be solved with a much simpler algorithm than <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/8848082/47978">this previous answer</a>:</p>

<pre><code>def matcher (l1, l2):
    if (l1 == []):
        return (l2 == [] or l2 == ['*'])
    if (l2 == [] or l2[0] == '*'):
        return matcher(l2, l1)
    if (l1[0] == '*'):
        return (matcher(l1, l2[1:]) or matcher(l1[1:], l2))
    if (l1[0] == l2[0]):
        return matcher(l1[1:], l2[1:])
    else:
        return False
</code></pre>

<p>The key idea is that when you encounter a wildcard, you can explore two options : </p>

<ul>
<li>either advance in the list that contains the wildcard (and consider the wildcard matched whatever there was until now) </li>
<li>or advance in the list that doesn't contain the wildcard (and consider that whatever is at the head of the list has to be matched by the wildcard).</li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>How about the following:</p>

<pre><code>import re

def match(pat, lst):
  regex = ''.join(term if term != '*' else '.*' for term in pat) + '$'
  s = ''.join(lst)
  return re.match(regex, s) is not None

print match( ['A', 'B', '*', 'D'], ['A', 'B', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'D'] )
</code></pre>

<p>It uses regular expressions. Wildcards (<code>*</code>) are changed to <code>.*</code> and all other search terms are kept as-is.</p>

<p>One caveat is that if your search terms could contain things that have special meaning in the regex language, those would need to be properly escaped. It's pretty easy to handle this in the <code>match</code> function, I just wasn't sure if this was something you required.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I'd recommend converting <code>['A', 'B', '*', 'D']</code> to <code>'^AB.*D$'</code>, <code>['A', 'B', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'D']</code> to <code>'ABCCCD'</code>, and then using the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/re.html" rel="nofollow"><code>re</code></a> module (regular expressions) to do the match.</p>

<p>This will be valid if the elements of your lists are only one character each, and if they're strings.</p>

<p>something like:</p>

<pre><code>import(re)
def myMatch( patternList, stringList ):
    # convert pattern to flat string with wildcards
    # convert AB*D to valid regex ^AB.*D$
    pattern = ''.join(patternList) 
    regexPattern = '^' + pattern.replace('*','.*') + '$' 
    # perform matching
    against = ''.join(stringList) # convert ['A','B','C','C','D'] to ABCCCD
    # return whether there is a match
    return (re.match(regexPattern,against) is not None)
</code></pre>

<p>If the lists contain numbers, or words, choose a character that you wouldn't expect to be in either, for example <code>#</code>. Then <code>['Aa','Bs','Ce','Cc','CC','Dd']</code> can be converted to <code>Aa#Bs#Ce#Cc#CC#Dd</code>, the wildcard pattern <code>['Aa','Bs','*','Dd']</code> could be converted to <code>^Aa#Bs#.*#Dd$</code>, and the match performed.</p>

<p>Practically speaking this just means all the <code>''.join(...)</code> becomes <code>'#'.join(...)</code> in <code>myMatch</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I agree with the comment regarding this could be done with regular expressions. For example:</p>

<pre><code>import re

lst = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'D']
pattern = ['A', 'B', 'C+', 'D']

print re.match(''.join(pattern), ''.join(lst)) # Will successfully match
</code></pre>

<p>Edit: As pointed out by a comment, it might be known in advance just that some character has to be matched, but not which one. In that case, regular expressions are useful still:</p>

<pre><code>import re

lst = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'D']
pattern = r'AB(\w)\1*D'

print re.match(pattern, ''.join(lst)).groups()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I agree, regular expressions are usually the way to go with this sort of thing. This algorithm works, but it just looks convoluted to me. It was fun to write though.</p>
