<h3>Question (ID-339217):</h3><h2>Writing a compiler for a DSL in python</h2><p>I am writing a game in python and have decided to create a DSL for the map data files. I know I could write my own parser with regex, but I am wondering if there are existing python tools which can do this more easily, like re2c which is used in the PHP engine.</p>

<p>Some extra info:</p>

<ul>
<li>Yes, I <em>do</em> need a DSL, and even if I didn't I still want the experience of building and using one in a project.</li>
<li><p>The DSL contains only data (declarative?), it doesn't get "executed". Most lines look like:</p>

<p><code>SOMETHING: !abc @123 #xyz/123</code></p>

<p>I just need to read the tree of data.</p></li>
</ul>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>There are plenty of Python parsing tools: <a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/text/python-parsers.html" rel="nofollow">http://nedbatchelder.com/text/python-parsers.html</a></p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Here's an approach that works really well.</p>

<pre><code>abc= ONETHING( ... )
xyz= ANOTHERTHING( ... )
pqr= SOMETHING( this=abc, that=123, more=(xyz,123) )
</code></pre>

<p>Declarative.  Easy-to-parse.  </p>

<p>And...</p>

<p>It's actually Python.  A few class declarations and the work is done.  The DSL is actually class declarations.</p>

<p>What's important is that a DSL merely creates objects.  When you define a DSL, first you have to start with an object model.  Later, you put some syntax around that object model.  You don't start with syntax, you start with the model.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Yes, there are many -- too many -- parsing tools, but none in the standard library.</p>

<p>From what what I saw PLY and SPARK are popular. <a href="http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/" rel="nofollow">PLY</a> is like yacc, but you do everything in Python because you write your grammar in docstrings.</p>

<p>Personally, I like the concept of parser combinators (taken from functional programming), and I quite like <a href="http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/" rel="nofollow">pyparsing</a>: you write your grammar and actions directly in python and it is easy to start with. I ended up producing my own tree node types with actions though, instead of using their default <code>ParserElement</code> type.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you can also use existing declarative language like <a href="http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/" rel="nofollow">YAML</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I have written something like this in work to read in SNMP notification definitions and automatically generate Java classes and SNMP MIB files from this. Using this little DSL, I could write 20 lines of my specification and it would generate roughly 80 lines of Java code and a 100 line MIB file.</p>

<p>To implement this, I actually just used straight Python string handling (split(), slicing etc) to parse the file. I find Pythons string capabilities to be adequate for most of my (simple) parsing needs.</p>

<p>Besides the libraries mentioned by others, if I were writing something more complex and needed proper parsing capabilities, I would probably use <a href="http://www.antlr.org/" rel="nofollow">ANTLR</a>, which supports Python (and other languages).</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Peter,</p>

<p>DSLs are a <em>good thing</em>, so you don't need to defend yourself :-)
However, have you considered an internal DSL ? These have so many pros versus external (parsed) DSLs that they're at least worth consideration. Mixing a DSL with the power of the native language really solves lots of the problems for you, and Python is not really bad at internal DSLs, with the <code>with</code> statement handy.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>For "small languages" as the one you are describing, I use a simple split, shlex (mind that the # defines a comment) or regular expressions. </p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; line = 'SOMETHING: !abc @123 #xyz/123'

&gt;&gt;&gt; line.split()
['SOMETHING:', '!abc', '@123', '#xyz/123']

&gt;&gt;&gt; import shlex
&gt;&gt;&gt; list(shlex.shlex(line))
['SOMETHING', ':', '!', 'abc', '@', '123']
</code></pre>

<p>The following is an example, as I do not know exactly what you are looking for.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import re
&gt;&gt;&gt; result = re.match(r'([A-Z]*): !([a-z]*) @([0-9]*) #([a-z0-9/]*)', line)
&gt;&gt;&gt; result.groups()
('SOMETHING', 'abc', '123', 'xyz/123')
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>On the lines of declarative python, I wrote a helper module called 'bpyml' which lets you declare data in python in a more XML structured way without the verbose tags, it can be converted to/from XML too, but is valid python.</p>
