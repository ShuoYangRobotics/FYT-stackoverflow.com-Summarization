<h3>Question (ID-665536):</h3><h2>How do I go about writing a program to send and receive sms using python?</h2><p>I have looked all over the net for a good library to use in sending and receiving sms's using python but all in vain!</p>

<p>Are there GSM libraries for python out there?</p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I have recently written some code for interacting with Huawei 3G USB modems in python.</p>

<p>My initial prototype used pyserial directly, and then my production code used Twisted's Serial support so I can access the modem asynchronously.</p>

<p>I found that by accessing the modem programatically using the serial port I was able to access all the functionality required to send and receive SMS messages using Hayes AT commands and extensions to the AT command set.</p>

<p>This is the <a href="http://wiki.forum.nokia.com/index.php/AT%5FCommands" rel="nofollow">one of the referneces</a> I was able to find on the topic, it lists these commands:</p>

<pre><code>AT+CMGL      List Messages
AT+CMGR     Read message
AT+CMGS     Send message
AT+CMGW     Write message to memory
</code></pre>

<p>They are complicated commands and take arguments and you have to parse the results yourself.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.developershome.com/sms/cmgsCommand.asp" rel="nofollow">There are more references</a> on the internet you can google for that reference these 4 commands that will let you work out how your modem works.</p>

<p>There's also a web service for sending and receiving SMS (non-free, of course), but I don't have URL at hand. :(</p>
