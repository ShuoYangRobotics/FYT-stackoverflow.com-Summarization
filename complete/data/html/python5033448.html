<h3>Question (ID-5033448):</h3><h2>"y" or "yes" -- expectations not met</h2><p>In the following code, <code>answer()</code> works as expected and returns true if input is "y" and false when not, but in <code>answer2()</code>, it always returns true.</p>

<p>Can someone explain why this is the case?</p>

<pre><code>def answer():
    answer = raw_input()
    if answer == "y":
        return True
    else:
        return False


def answer2():
    answer = raw_input()
    if answer == "y" or "yes":  # &lt;- notice the extra: or "yes"
        return True
    else:
        return False


if answer() == True:
    print "true"
else:
    print "false"


if answer2() == True:
    print "true"
else:
    print "false"
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The expression, <code>"y" or "yes"</code> will evaluate to <code>"y"</code>. What you want is:</p>

<pre><code>if answer in ('y', 'yes'):
    return True
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I'm not a Python expert, but I suspect in answer2 it should be:</p>

<pre><code>if answer == "y" or answer == "yes":  # &lt;- notice the extra: or "yes"
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, I suspect it's currently parsing it as:</p>

<pre><code>if (answer == "y") or ("yes")
</code></pre>

<p>and just converting "yes" into True, effectively... which is why it's always returning True.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You want</p>

<pre><code>if answer == "y" or answer == "yes":
</code></pre>

<p>you have to test it that way.</p>

<p>Or better still, have a list of affirmative responses and test inclusion;</p>

<pre><code>affirmatives = ["yes","y","ja","oui"]
if answer in affirmatives:
</code></pre>

<p>It's all to do with boolean (True/False) operators. Check out the following:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; "yes" == "yes" or "fnord"
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; "no" == "yes" or "fnord"
'fnord'
</code></pre>

<p>If the first part is True, you get True - if the first part is False, you get the right-hand side of the 'or'. Now, by having:</p>

<pre><code> answer == "y" or answer == "yes"
</code></pre>

<p>you can see how if the first == returns False it returns the second == test...</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>you need to say:</p>

<pre><code>if answer == "y" or answer == "yes"
</code></pre>

<p>how you did it evaluates as:</p>

<pre><code>if (answer == "y") or "yes"
</code></pre>

<p>which will always be true as "yes" is a non-empty string.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><pre><code>if answer == "y" or "yes":
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this is different that:</p>

<pre><code>if answer == "y" or answer == "yes":
</code></pre>

<p>Because "yes" is a non-zero value, the first one will always return True.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Here's the issue:</p>

<pre><code>answer == 'y' or 'yes' 
</code></pre>

<p>is always going to return True or 'yes' (effectively True since it is not 0 or None),because it's being evaluated as:</p>

<pre><code>if (answer == 'y') or 'yes'
</code></pre>

<p>so you are always going to trigger the 'if' block and return True. </p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Lots of people have explained the problem, so I won't repeat their explanation; but note that this is the (IMO) best way to test for multiple equivalent phrases:</p>

<pre><code>def answer(response):
    return response.upper() in ["Y", "YES", "TRUE", "T"] # and so on
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: or even better:</p>

<pre><code>def answer2(response):
    return any(s.startswith(response.upper()) for s in ["YES", "TRUE"])
</code></pre>
