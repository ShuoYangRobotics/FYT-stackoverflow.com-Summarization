<h3>Question (ID-243375):</h3><h2>Including a dynamic image in a web page using POST?</h2><p>I have written a CGI script that creates an image dynamically using GET data. To include this image in my webpage, I am using the following code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src="image.py?text=xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that I expect in the future the "text" field will get very long and the URL will become too large. From Googling around there doesn't seem to be a fixed limit on URL length (ie. depends on the browser, server, proxy, etc.) Is there a better way to do this? </p>

<p>If it matters, I am working with Django and Python and I cannot use any client-side scripting (ie. JavaScript).</p>

<p>Cheers,
Ben</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>This will get you an Image as the result of a POST -- you may not like it</p>

<ol>
<li>Put an iFrame where you want the image and size it and remove scrollbars</li>
<li>Set the src to a form with hidden inputs set to your post parameters and the action set to the URL that will generate the image</li>
<li><p>submit the form automatically with JavaScript in the body.onload of the iFrame's HTML</p>

<p>Then, either:</p></li>
<li><p>Serve back an content-type set to an image and stream the image bytes</p>

<p>or:</p></li>
<li><p>store the post parameters somewhere and generate a small id</p></li>
<li><p>serve back HTML with an img tag using the id in the url -- on the server look up the post parameters</p>

<p>or:</p></li>
<li><p>generate a page with an image tag with an embedded image</p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Putting together what has already been said, how about creating two pages. First page sends a POST request when the form is submitted (lets say to create_img.py) with a text=xxxxxxx... parameter. Then create_img.py takes the text parameter and creates an image with it and inserts it (or a filesystem reference) into the db, then when rendering the second page, generate img tags like <code>&lt;img src="render_img.py?row_id=0122"&gt;</code>. At this point, render_img.py simply queries the db for the given image. Before creating the image you can check to see if its already in the database therefore reusing/recycling previous images with the same text parameter.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>img's use GET.  You'll have to come up with another mechanism.  How about calling the same functionality in image.py and saving the file as a temp file which you ref in the img tag?  Or how about saving the value of text in a db row during the rendering of this img tag and using the row_id as what you pass into the image.py script?</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You may be able to mitigate the problem by compressing the text in the get parameter.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>From the link below it looks like you'll be fine for a while ;)</p>

<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>If you're using django, maybe you can do this via a template tag instead?</p>

<p>Something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src="{% create_image "This is the text that will be displayed" %}"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The create_image function would create the image with a dummy/random/generated filename, and return the path.</p>

<p>This avoids having to GET or POST to the script, and the images will have manageable filenames.</p>

<p>I can see some potential issues with this approach, I'm just tossing the idea out there ;)</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>OK, I'm a bit late to the party, but you could use a mix of MHTML (for IE7 and below) and the data URI scheme (for all other modern browsers). It does require a bit of work on both client and server but you can ultimately end up with</p>

<pre><code>newimg.src = 'blah';
</code></pre>
