<h3>Question (ID-3851829):</h3><h2>Howto do reference to ints by name in Python</h2><p>I want to have a a reference that reads as "whatever variable of name 'x' is pointing to" with ints so that it behaves as:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; c = (a, b)
&gt;&gt;&gt; c
(1, 2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 3
&gt;&gt;&gt; c
(3, 2)
</code></pre>

<p>I know I could do something similar with lists by doing:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = [2]
&gt;&gt;&gt; c = (a, b)
&gt;&gt;&gt; c
([1], [2])
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[0] = 3
&gt;&gt;&gt; c
([3], [2])
</code></pre>

<p>but this can be easily lost if one assigns <strong>a</strong> or <strong>b</strong> to something instead of their elements.</p>

<p>Is there a simple way to do this?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>No, there isn't a direct way to do this in Python. The reason is that both scalar values (numbers) and tuples are <em>immutable</em>. Once you have established a binding from a name to an immutable value (such as the name <code>c</code> with the tuple <code>(1, 2)</code>), nothing you do except reassigning <code>c</code> can change the value it's bound to.</p>

<p>Note that in your second example, although the tuple is itself immutable, it contains references to mutable values. So it <em>appears</em> as though the tuple changes, but the identity of the tuple remains constant and only the mutable parts are changing.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Whatever possible solution you come up with the second last line will always destroy it:</p>

<pre><code>a = 3
</code></pre>

<p>This will assign a completely new content to the variable. Unless <code>a</code> stands for a property of an object or something (or a key in a list, as you did in your own example), you won't be able to have a relation between the first and last <code>a</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If you just need the current values to be placed in a tuple on the fly you could use a lambda.  You'll have to call c, not just return it or use it, but that may be acceptable in your situation.  Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; c = lambda: (a, b)
&gt;&gt;&gt; c()
(1, 2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 3
&gt;&gt;&gt; c()
(3, 2)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>There isn't a way in Python, not only because numbers are immutable, but also because you don't have pointers. Wrapping the value in a list simulates that you have pointers, so that's the best you can do.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><pre><code>class ByRefValue(object):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
</code></pre>

<p>Pass it around wherever you like, remembering that you need to access the <code>value</code> member rather than the entire object.</p>

<hr>

<p>Alternatively, <code>globals().get('a', 0)</code> will return the value of <code>a</code> if it is in the global namespace (or zero if it isn't).</p>

<hr>

<p>Finally:</p>

<pre><code>import threading
tls = threading.local()

tls.a = 1
</code></pre>

<p>If you import <code>tls</code> into every module where you need it, you will access the same value for <code>a</code> <em>on each thread</em>. Depending on how your program is set up, this may be acceptable, ideal or useless.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You can try creating your own pointer class and your own pointer storage object to emulate the system's internal stack.</p>
