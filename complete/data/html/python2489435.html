<h3>Question (ID-2489435):</h3><h2>How could I check if a number is a perfect square?</h2><p>I'm pretty stumped with this one guys. I'm trying to toy with Python (as you can see with my previous questions) so I'd really love some help here. :P </p>

<p>Speeds is of no concern for now, just working.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Edit: I ended up doing it this way:</p>

<pre><code>def isSquare(number):
    temp = math.sqrt(int(number))    
    if "." in str(abs(int(temp))):
        return False
    else:
        return True
</code></pre>

<p>Any criticism or suggestions?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-9):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The problem with relying on any floating point computation (<code>math.sqrt(x)</code>, or <code>x**0.5</code>) is that you can't really be sure it's exact (for sufficiently large integers <code>x</code>, it won't be, and might even overflow). Fortunately (if one's in no hurry;-) there are many pure integer approaches, such as the following...:</p>

<pre><code>def is_square(apositiveint):
  x = apositiveint // 2
  seen = set([x])
  while x * x != apositiveint:
    x = (x + (apositiveint // x)) // 2
    if x in seen: return False
    seen.add(x)
  return True

for i in range(110, 130):
   print i, is_square(i)
</code></pre>

<p>Hint: it's based on the "Babylonian algorithm" for square root, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots" rel="nofollow">wikipedia</a>.  It <em>does</em> work for any positive number for which you have enough memory for the computation to proceed to completion;-).</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: let's see an example...</p>

<pre><code>x = 12345678987654321234567 ** 2

for i in range(x, x+2):
   print i, is_square(i)
</code></pre>

<p>this prints, as desired (and in a reasonable amount of time, too;-):</p>

<pre><code>152415789666209426002111556165263283035677489 True
152415789666209426002111556165263283035677490 False
</code></pre>

<p>Please, before you propose solutions based on floating point intermediate results, make sure they work correctly on this simple example -- it's not <strong>that</strong> hard (you just need a few extra checks in case the sqrt computed is a little off), just takes a bit of care.</p>

<p>And then try with <code>x**7</code> and find clever way to work around the problem you'll get,</p>

<pre><code>OverflowError: long int too large to convert to float
</code></pre>

<p>you'll have to get more and more clever as the numbers keep growing, of course.</p>

<p>If I <em>was</em> in a hurry, of course, I'd use <a href="http://www.gmpy.org/" rel="nofollow">gmpy</a> -- but then, I'm clearly biased;-).</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import gmpy
&gt;&gt;&gt; gmpy.is_square(x**7)
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; gmpy.is_square(x**7 + 1)
0
</code></pre>

<p>Yeah, I know, that's just so easy it feels like cheating (a bit the way I feel towards Python in general;-) -- no cleverness at all, just perfect directness and simplicity (and, in the case of gmpy, sheer speed;-)...</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Use newton's method to quickly zero in the nearest integer square root, then square it and see if it's your number. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isqrt" rel="nofollow">isqrt</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def f(x):
...     x = x ** 0.5
...     return int(x) == x
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(10):
...     print i, f(i)

0 True
1 True
2 False
3 False
4 True
5 False
6 False
7 False
8 False
9 True
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Since you can never depend on exact comparisons when dealing with floating point computations (such as these ways of calculating the square root), a less error-prone implementation would be</p>

<pre><code>import math
def is_square(integer):
    root = math.sqrt(integer)
    if int(root + 0.5) ** 2 == integer: 
        return True
    else:
        return False
</code></pre>

<p>Imagine <code>integer</code> is <code>9</code>. <code>math.sqrt(9)</code> could be <code>3.0</code>, but it could also be something like <code>2.99999</code> or <code>3.00001</code>, so squaring the result right off isn't reliable. Knowing that <code>int</code> takes the floor value, increasing the float value by <code>0.5</code> first means we'll get the value we're looking for if we're in a range where <code>float</code> still has a fine enough resolution to represent numbers near the one for which we are looking.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You could binary-search for the rounded square root. Square the result to see if it matches the original value.</p>

<p>You're probably better off with FogleBirds answer - though beware, as floating point arithmetic is approximate, which can throw this approach off. You could in principle get a false positive from a large integer which is one more than a perfect square, for instance, due to lost precision.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I'm new to Stack Overflow, and did a quick skim to find a solution. I just posted a slight variation on some of the examples above on another thread (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1547196/finding-perfect-square/5750159#5750159">Finding perfect squares</a>) and thought I'd include a slight variation of what I posted there here (using nsqrt as a temporary variable), in case it's of interest / use:</p>

<pre><code>import math
def is_perfect_square(n):
  if not ( ( isinstance(n, int) or isinstance(n, long) ) and ( n &gt;= 0 ) ):
    return False 
  else:
    nsqrt = math.sqrt(n)
    return nsqrt == math.trunc(nsqrt)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I'm not sure of the Python, but you could do something like:</p>

<pre><code>function isSquare(x) = x == floor(sqrt(x) + 0.5)^2
</code></pre>

<p>That is, take a number, find the square root, round it to the nearest integer, square it, and test if it's the same as the original number. (<code>floor</code> and adding <code>0.5</code> is done to prevent cases like <code>sqrt(4)</code> returning <code>1.9999999...</code> due to floating point math, as Mike Graham pointed out.)</p>

<p>In case you're interested, there was once a very good discussion on the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/295579/fastest-way-to-determine-if-an-integers-square-root-is-an-integer">Fastest way to determine if an integerâ€™s square root is an integer</a>.</p>

<p><em>Edited for clarification.</em></p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><ol>
<li>Decide how long the number will be.</li>
<li>take a delta 0.000000000000.......000001</li>
<li>see if the (sqrt(x))^2 - x is greater / equal /smaller than delta and decide based on the delta error.</li>
</ol>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>This response doesn't pertain to your stated question, but to an implicit question I see in the code you posted, ie, "how to check if something is an integer?"</p>

<p>The first answer you'll generally get to that question is "Don't!" And it's true that in Python, typechecking is usually not the right thing to do.</p>

<p>For those rare exceptions, though, instead of looking for a decimal point in the string representation of the number, the thing to do is use the <em>isinstance</em> function:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance(5,int)
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance(5.0,int)
False
</code></pre>

<p>Of course this applies to the variable rather than a value. If I wanted to determine whether the <em>value</em> was an integer, I'd do this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x=5.0
&gt;&gt;&gt; round(x) == x
True
</code></pre>

<p>But as everyone else has covered in detail, there are floating-point issues to be considered in most non-toy examples of this kind of thing.</p>
