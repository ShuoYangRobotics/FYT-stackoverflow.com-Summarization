<h3>Question (ID-5273026):</h3><h2>Python List / Index Query</h2><p>I am asking a user to enter a number, in which I want to print the item held at that index point in the list..</p>

<p>This is the code i currently have:</p>

<pre><code>List = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"]

print "The list has the following", len(List), "list:", List

new_item = raw_input("Which item would you like to add? ")
List.append(new_item)
print "The list has the following", len(List), "items:", List

Number = raw_input ("Please select a number: ")
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Try converting <code>Number</code> to an integer first:</p>

<pre><code>i = int(Number)                                                                 
print "You selected:", List[i]
</code></pre>

<p>Incidentally, it's good Python style to make variables lower case, and keep identifiers that begin with a capital letter for classes.  So, instead of <code>List</code> you could use <code>my_list</code> and instead of <code>Number</code> just use <code>number</code>.  (You shouldn't use <code>list</code> as a variable name since that will hide the built-in <code>list</code> type.)</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><pre><code>l = ["a", "b", "c"]
ii = raw_input("Please select a number: ")
print l[ii]
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>What you are attempting to do is called "indexing" a string. It is achieved as follows</p>

<pre><code>letter_at_index = my_list[index]
</code></pre>

<p>Note that indices start from 0, that is,</p>

<pre><code>my_list = ['a', 'b', 'c']
a = my_list[0]
b = my_list[1]
c = my_list[2]
</code></pre>

<p>Negative indices can be specified as well, for example</p>

<pre><code>c = my_list[-1]
</code></pre>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><pre><code>List = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"]
print "The list has the following", len(List), "list:", List
try:
    Number = raw_input ("Please select a number: ")
    item = List[int(Number)]
    print "The list item at", Number, "is", item
except EOFError:
    print "Error.  Nothing entered"
except ValueError:
    print "Error.  Expecting a number instead of:", Number

    print "Error.  Number out of range:", Number

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><pre><code>List = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"]

print "The list has the following length: "+str( len(List))+ "\n list:"+repr( List)

List.append(raw_input("\nWhich item would you like to add? "))

print "\nThe list has the following length: "+str( len(List))+ "\n list:"+repr( List)

print '\nThe item at the position you entered is : '+\
      repr(List[int(raw_input ("\nPlease select a number: "))])[1:-1]
</code></pre>

<p>Result</p>

<pre><code>The list has the following length: 6
 list:['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']

Which item would you like to add? (12,52,145)

The list has the following length: 7
 list:['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', '(12,52,145)']

Please select a number: 6

The item at the position you entered is : (12,52,145)

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>try the following:</p>

<pre><code>i = None
listend = len(List)-1
while i == None:
    try:
        print ''
        raw = raw_input("Which item would you like to add? ")
        i = int(raw)
        value = List[i]
    except IndexError:
        print i, 'is out of bounds. Expecting an integer from 0 to', listend 
        i = None
    except:
        print 'You entered "%s" however I was expecting an integer from 0 to %s'%(raw, listend)
    else:
        print 'Result:', List[i]
</code></pre>

<p>It is often useful to loop while waiting for acceptable input in this way - you will notice that <code>i</code> is only set to something other than <code>None</code>  if <code>int(raw)</code> runs successfully, and if it is out of your list's bounds you set it back to <code>None</code>. The <code>else</code> statement is not strictly necessary as its content could go outside of the <code>while</code> loop, however it seem to be the situation it was designed for - running a block of code only if the try block has not thrown an exception, while not handling exceptions itself.</p>
