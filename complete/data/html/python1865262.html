<h3>Question (ID-1865262):</h3><h2>What languages other than Python have an explicit self?</h2><p>It seems a bit weird that Python requires you to explicitly pass <code>self</code> as the first argument to all class functions. Are there other languages that require something similar?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>By explicit, do you mean "explicitly passed as an argument to each class function"?
If so, then Python is the only one I know off-hand. </p>

<p>Most OO languages support <code>this</code> or <code>self</code> in some form, but most of them let you define class functions without always defining <code>self</code> as the first argument.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Depending on your point of view, Lua.  To quote the reference: "A call v:name(args) is syntactic sugar for v.name(v,args), except that v is evaluated only once."  You can also define methods using either notation.  So you could say that Lua has an optional explicit self.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>F# (presumably from its OCAML heritage) requires an explicit name for all self-references; though the name is any arbitrary identifier e.g.</p>

<pre><code> override x.BeforeAnalysis() = 
    base.BeforeAnalysis()
    DoWithLock x.AddReference
</code></pre>

<p>Here we're defining an overriding member function <code>BeforeAnalysis</code> which calls another member function <code>AddReference</code>.  The identifier <code>x</code> here is arbitrary, but is required in both the declaration and any reference to members of the "this"/"self" instance.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The programming language Oberon 2 has an explicitly <em>named</em> but not explicitly passed 'this' or 'self' argument for member functions of classes (known as type bound procedures in Oberon terminology)</p>

<p>The following example is an Insert method on a type Text, where the identifier 't' is specified to bind to the explicit 'this' or 'self' reference.</p>

<pre><code>PROCEDURE (t: Text) Insert (string: ARRAY OF CHAR; pos: LONGINT);
BEGIN ...
END Insert;
</code></pre>

<p>More details on Object Orientation in Oberon are <a href="http://www.statlab.uni-heidelberg.de/projects/oberon/kurs/www/Oberon2.OOP.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented%5Fprogramming" rel="nofollow">Object-Oriented language</a> has a notion of this or self within member functions.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modula-3#Object_Oriented" rel="nofollow">Modula-3</a> does. Which is not too surprising since Python's class mechanism is <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/classes.html#" rel="nofollow">a mixture of the ones found in Modula-3 and C++</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>many object oriented languages if not all of them</p>

<p>for example c++ support "this" instead of "self"</p>

<p>but you dont have to pass it, it is passed passively</p>

<p>hope that helps ;)</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p><a href="http://clojure.org/" rel="nofollow">Clojure</a> isn't an OOP language but does use explicit self parameters in some circumstances: most notably when you implement a protocol, and the "self" argument (you can name it anything you like) is the first parameter to a protocol method. This argument is then used for polymorphic dispatch to determine the right function implementation, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>(defprotocol MyProtocol
  (foo [this that]))

(extend-protocol MyProtocol String
  (foo [this that]
    (str this " and " that)))

(extend-protocol MyProtocol Long
  (foo [this that]
    (* this that)))

(foo "Cat" "Dog")
=&gt; "Cat and Dog"

(foo 10 20)
=&gt; 200
</code></pre>

<p>Also, the first parameter to a function is often used by convention to mean the object that is being acted upon, e.g. the following code to append to a vector:</p>

<pre><code>(conj [1 2 3] 4)
=&gt; [1 2 3 4]
</code></pre>
