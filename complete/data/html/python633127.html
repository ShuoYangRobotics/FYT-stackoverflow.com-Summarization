<h3>Question (ID-633127):</h3><h2>python: viewing all defined variables</h2><p>I'm currently working on a computation in python shell. What I want to have is Matlab style listout where you can see all the variables that have been defined up to a point (so I know which names I've used, their values and such).</p>

<p>Is there a way and how would one go in python about that ?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Couple of things you could use:</p>

<ul>
<li>dir () will give you the list of in scope variables:</li>
<li>globals () will give  you a dictionary of global variables</li>
<li>locals () will give you a dictionary of local variables</li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>print locals()</p>

<p>edit continued from comment.</p>

<p>To make it look a little prettier when printing:</p>

<pre><code>import sys, pprint
sys.displayhook = pprint.pprint
locals()
</code></pre>

<p>That should give you a more vertical printout.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>To get the names:</p>

<pre><code>for name in vars().keys():
  print(name)
</code></pre>

<p>To get the values:</p>

<pre><code>for value in vars().values():
  print(value)
</code></pre>

<p>vars() also takes an optional argument to find out which vars are defined within an object itself. </p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>keep in mind dir() will return all current imports, <strong>AND</strong> variables.</p>

<p>if you just want your variables, I would suggest a naming scheme that is easy to extract from dir, such as varScore, varNames, etc.</p>

<p>that way, you can simply do this:</p>

<pre><code>for vars in dir():
 if vars.startswith("var"):
   print vars
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>if you want to list all variables, but exclude imported modules and variables such as:</p>

<pre><code>__builtins__
</code></pre>

<p>you can use something like so:</p>

<pre><code>import os
import re

x = 11
imports = "os","re"

for vars in dir():
    if vars.startswith("__") == 0 and vars not in imports:
    	print vars
</code></pre>

<p>as you can see, it will show the variable "imports" though, because it is a variable (well, a tuple). A quick workaround is to add the word "imports" into the imports tuple itself!</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>If this is an option for you, you might want to look at <a href="http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/" rel="nofollow">IPython</a>:</p>

<p>To get a list of all currently defined variables, type <code>who</code>:</p>

<pre><code>In [1]: foo = 'bar'

In [2]: who
foo
</code></pre>

<p>You can type <code>whos</code> for more detail:</p>

<pre><code>In [3]: whos
Variable   Type    Data/Info
----------------------------
foo        str     bar
</code></pre>

<p>There are a wealth of other functions available - basically it is the Python interpreter on steroids. One convenient one is <code>store</code> command, which lets you save variables between sessions (kind of like a super easy <code>pickle</code>)</p>

<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>globals(), locals(), vars(), and dir() may all help you in what you want.</p>
