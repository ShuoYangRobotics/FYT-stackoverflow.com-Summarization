<h3>Question (ID-3744048):</h3><h2>python: how to merge a list into clusters?</h2><p>I have a list of tuples:</p>

<pre><code>[(3,4), (18,27), (4,14)]
</code></pre>

<p>and need a code merging tuples which has repeated numbers, making another list where all list elements will only contain unique numbers. The list should be sorted by the length of the tuples, i.e.:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; MergeThat([(3,4), (18,27), (4,14)])
[(3,4,14), (18,27)]

&gt;&gt;&gt; MergeThat([(1,3), (15,21), (1,10), (57,66), (76,85), (66,76)])
[(57,66,76,85), (1,3,10), (15,21)]
</code></pre>

<p>I understand it's something similar to hierarchical clustering algorithms, which I've read about, but can't figure them out.</p>

<p>Is there a relatively simple code for a MergeThat() function?</p>

<p>Here's a snippet (including doctests): <a href="http://gist.github.com/586252" rel="nofollow">http://gist.github.com/586252</a></p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I tried hard to figure this out, but only after I tried the approach Ian's answer (thanks!) suggested I realized what the theoretical problem is: The input is a list of edges and defines a graph. We are looking for the strongly connected components of this graph. It's simple as that.</p>

<p>While you can <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarjan%27s_strongly_connected_components_algorithm" rel="nofollow">do this efficiently</a>, there is actually no reason to implement this yourself! Just import a <a href="http://networkx.lanl.gov/" rel="nofollow">good graph library</a>:</p>

<pre><code>import networkx as nx

# one of your examples
g1 = nx.Graph([(1,3), (15,21), (1,10), (57,66), (76,85), (66,76)])
print nx.connected_components(g1) # [[57, 66, 76, 85], [1, 10, 3], [21, 15]]

# my own test case
g2 =  nx.Graph([(1,2),(2,10), (20,3), (3,4), (4,10)])
print nx.connected_components(g2) # [[1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 20]]

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>The code others have written will surely work, but here's another option, maybe simpler to understand and maybe less algorithmic complexity.</p>

<p>Keep a dictionary from numbers to the cluster (implemented as a python set) they're a member of. Also include that number in the corresponding set. Process an input pair either as:</p>

<ol>
<li>Neither element is in the dictionary: create a new set, hook up dictionary links appropriately.</li>
<li>One or the other, but not both elements are in the dictionary: Add the yet-unseen element to the set of its brother, and add its dictionary link into the correct set.</li>
<li>Both elements are seen before, but in different sets: Take the union of the old sets and update all dictionary links to the new set.</li>
<li>You've seen both members before, and they're in the same set: Do nothing.</li>
</ol>

<p>Afterward, simply collect the unique values from the dictionary and sort in descending order of size. This portion of the job is O(m log n) and thus will not dominate runtime.</p>

<p>This should work in a single pass. Writing the actual code is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>This is not efficient for huge lists.</p>

<pre><code>def merge_that(lot):
   final_list = []
   while len(lot) &gt;0 :
      temp_set = set(lot[0])
      deletable = [0]      #list of all tuples consumed by temp_set
      for i, tup2 in enumerate(lot[1:]):
         if tup2[0] in temp_set or tup2[1] in temp_set:
            deletable.append(i)
            temp_set = temp_set.union(tup2)
      for d in deletable:
         del lot[d]
      deletable = []
      # Some of the tuples consumed later might have missed their brothers
      # So, looping again after deleting the consumed tuples
      for i, tup2 in enumerate(lot):
         if tup2[0] in temp_set or tup2[1] in temp_set:
            deletable.append(i)
            temp_set = temp_set.union(tup2)
      for d in deletable:
         del lot[d]
      final_list.append(tuple(temp_set))
   return final_list

<p>It looks ugly but works.</p>
