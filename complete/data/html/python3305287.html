<h3>Question (ID-3305287):</h3><h2>Python -- How do you view output that doesn't fit the screen?</h2><p>I should say I'm looking for a solution to the problem of <strong>viewing output that does not fit on your screen.</strong> For example, range(100) will show the last 30ish lines in your terminal of 30 height. </p>

<p>I am only looking to be nudged in the right direction and am curious how you guys have approached this problem. </p>

<p>What have you done when you run into a situation where you wish you could conveniently scroll through some large output? </p>

<h2>Best Answer</h2>

<p>Use the scrollback buffer on your terminal. </p>

<p>If you're using GNU Screen, it can be set with <code>defscrollback 1000</code> or any other number in <code>HOME/.screenrc</code>. </p>

<p>Use <code>Ctrl-a, [</code> to enter copy mode</p>

<pre><code>j -    Move the cursor down by one line
k -    Move the cursor up by one line
C-u -  Scrolls a half page up.
C-b -  Scrolls a full page up.
C-d -  Scrolls a half page down.
C-f -  Scrolls the full page down.
G -    Moves to the specified line 
</code></pre>

<p>The best part is <code>?</code> for reverse search, <code>/</code> for forward search while in copy mode. </p>

<p>Super convenient.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<h2>Original question:</h2>

<p>What is the python equivalent of the bash less command? </p>

<pre><code>LongString | less 
</code></pre>

<p>Is there something like that for python? I find myself thinking I could use it fairly often but just move on and find some other solution. </p>

<p>By "long things" I mean anything that generates more output lines than my screen. 1000 print messages, a dictionary, a large string, range(1000), etc. </p>

<p>My googlefu has failed.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Yes, there is a way and it is quite trivial, that's why not specifically described. Say you have long list and want to see just the beginning:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; lst = range(1000)   # let's make list of thousand elements
&gt;&gt;&gt; lst[:100]           # i want to see just the first 100

<p>The same <code>[]</code> slicing works the same for strings. For dictionary you can cheat somehow, like   using <code>str()</code> to convert it to string and then display with the same slicing :-)</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>If you want to do this for an interactive python session, you should use a terminal emulation that allows you to scroll back up. I believe most of them do.</p>

<p>If you're using an actual terminal, or if you don't have a choice of terminal emulators, perhaps you can use <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/" rel="nofollow">GNU screen</a>. </p>

<p>(If you're using Windows, you can change the screen buffer size to allow scrolling back up to 9999 lines).</p>

<p>And if you need this for the output of your program, you can try to use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/curses.html" rel="nofollow">curses</a> module to implement scrolling yourself.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If you work in <a href="http://ipython.scipy.org/doc/stable/html/overview.html" rel="nofollow">ipython</a> you can issue shell commands within your interactive python session. That means that you just do</p>

<pre><code>In [1]: less myfile.txt
</code></pre>

<p>I also really like being able to arrow up and down to get previous commands and getting the output from previous commands by doing something like</p>

<pre><code>In [33]: print cos(Out[7]*pi/180)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>if your data is json serilizable then you can try</p>

<pre><code>import simplejson
print simplejson.dumps({'shipping-line': {'price': '0.00', 'code': 'Local Pickup (Portland, OR)', 'title': 'Local Pickup (Portland, OR)'}}, indent=4)
</code></pre>

<p>Output will be look something like</p>

<pre><code>{
    "shipping-line": {
        "price": "0.00", 
        "code": "Local Pickup (Portland, OR)", 
        "title": "Local Pickup (Portland, OR)"
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>this is specifically used to debug and to see the actual content......in well readble format..</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>if your screen is limited to 25 lines..........</p>

<pre><code>import simplejson
data = simplejson.dumps({'shipping-line': {'price': '0.00', 'code': 'Local Pickup (Portland, OR)', 'title': 'Local Pickup (Portland, OR)'}}, indent=4)

cnt = 0

for line in data.split('\n'):
    cnt+=1
    print line
    raw_input() if cnt%25==0 else None
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>It's easy to write your own:</p>

<pre><code>def less(s, line_count = 5):
    lines = []
    for i, line in enumerate(s.split('\n'), 1):
        lines.append(line)
        if (i % line_count) == 0:
            yield '\n'.join(lines)
            lines = []

    if lines:
        yield '\n'.join(lines)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>There's one fundamental difference between less run in a shell, and Python: Python is a programming language, less is a program.</p>

<p>Bash is aware of what the linecount is in the console, and less can query that (and a number of other things), Python on its own can't be, it's a language and it's agnostic to its environment (that's left to libraries).</p>

<p>On top of that, less obeys some of its own standards. Careted lines get moved to top, it feeds to termcap, it's conceptually part of the OS tools, and it's meant to send to output even if it hasn't finished reading the file.</p>

<p>You can write less in Python if you want, or run it from inside a python script, but its functionality is more (and too specific) than a single method of file should contain.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>just for fun :o)</p>

<pre><code>class Less(object):
    def __init__(self, num_lines):
        self.num_lines = num_lines
    def __ror__(self, other):
        s = str(other).split("\n")
        for i in range(0, len(s), self.num_lines):
            print "\n".join(s[i:i+self.num_lines])
            raw_input("Press &lt;Enter&gt; for more")

less=Less(num_lines=30)  
"\n".join(map(str,range(100))) | less

<ol>
<li><p>Don't create large output.  Use functions to summarize or show selected details.</p></li>
<li><p>Simplify the application to avoid creating large output in the first place.</p></li>
<li><p>Focus what I'm looking at to avoid large output.</p></li>
<li><p>Generally avoid large output.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>It seems simpler to avoid large output than to fuss around trying to display something I never cared about in the first place.</p>
