<h3>Question (ID-4531794):</h3><h2>What's the logical value of "string" in Python?</h2><p>I erroneously wrote this code in Python:</p>

<pre><code>name = input("what is your name?")
if name == "Kamran" or "Samaneh":
    print("That is a nice name")
else:
    print("You have a boring name ;)")
</code></pre>

<p>It always prints out "That is a nice name" even when the input is neither "Kamran" nor "Samaneh". </p>

<p>Am I correct in saying that it considers "Samaneh" as a true? Why?</p>

<p>By the way, I already noticed my mistake. The correct form is:</p>

<pre><code>if name == "Kamran" or name == "Samaneh":
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Any non empty string in Python (and most other languages) is true as are all non-zero numbers and non-empty lists, dictionaries, sets and tuples.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>A nicer way to do what you want is:</p>

<pre><code>name = input("what is your name?")
if name in ("Kamran", "Samaneh"):
    print("That is a nice name")
else:
    print("You have a boring name ;)")
</code></pre>

<p>This creates a tuple containing the names that you want and performs a membership test.</p>

<p><sup>1 As delnan points out in the comments, this applies to all <em>well written</em> collections. That is, if you implement a custom collection class, make sure that it is false when it's empty.</sup></p>

<p>"....All other values are considered true â€” so objects of many types are always true."</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>In Python an empty string is considered <code>False</code>, <code>True</code> otherwise.</p>

<p>You could use the <code>in</code> operator:</p>

<pre><code>if name in ("Kamran","Samaneh"):
    print("That is a nice name")
else:
    print("You have a boring name ;)")
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Besides the empty string <code>''</code>, strings will all evaluate to <code>True</code> (see <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#truth-value-testing" rel="nofollow">this page for a full list of values of all types that evaluate to <code>False</code></a>. This follows the logic of many other programming languages (except some which also evaluate strings like <code>'0'</code>, <code>'false'</code>, etc. to <code>False</code>). The exact decision of what to do is somewhat arbitrary, but the choice made can be explained as allowing the cast to be used as a simple way to test for empty (default, or unpopulated) strings.</p>

<p>You can always force a cast of any type to <code>bool</code> using the <code>bool()</code> function.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; bool('')
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; bool('non-empty string')
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; bool('0')
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; bool('False')
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; bool('false')
True
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>A non-empty string is True, yes. An empty one is False. This is super-handy.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Evidently, it must be:</p>

<pre><code>name = raw_input("what is your name?")
</code></pre>

<p>not</p>

<pre><code>name = input("what is your name?")
</code></pre>

<p>.</p>

<p>What you wrote is like:</p>

<pre><code>if (name == "Kamran" or "Samaneh")
</code></pre>

<p>Another good expression is:</p>

<pre><code>if name == ("Kamran" or "Samaneh")
</code></pre>

<p>But I also prefer if name in ("Kamran" or "Samaneh") as already shown</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>By the way, it can be written:</p>

<pre><code>print("That is a nice name" if raw_input("what is your name?") in ("Kamran","Samaneh")
      else "You have a boring name ;)")
</code></pre>
