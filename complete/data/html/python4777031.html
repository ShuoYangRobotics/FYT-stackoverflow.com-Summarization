<h3>Question (ID-4777031):</h3><h2>Shortcut for if __name__ == '__main__':</h2><p>Is there a shorter form of this?</p>

<pre><code>if __name__ == '__main__':
</code></pre>

<p>It is pretty tedious to write, and also doesn't look very nice in my opinion :)</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Basically every python programmer does that. So simply live with it. ;)</p>

<p>Besides that you could omit it completely if your script is always meant to be run as an application and not imported as a module - but you are encouraged to use it anyway, even if it's not really necessary.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>PEP299 proposed a solution to this wart, namely having a special function name <code>__main__</code>. It was rejected, partly because:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Guido pronounced that he doesn't like
  the idea anyway as it's "not worth the
  change (in docs, user habits, etc.)
  and there's nothing particularly
  broken."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0299/">http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0299/</a></p>

<p>So the ugliness will stay, at least as long as Guido's the BDFL.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>No, sorry, there is not.  It doesn't look great, but it's what we've got.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>It's definitely a wart in the language, as is anything that becomes boilerplate and gets copied and pasted from file to file.  There's no shorthand for it.</p>

<p>As warts and boilerplate go, though, at least it's minor.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You mean shorter like <code>if'__main__'==__name__:</code> ?</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>After asking this question, I decided to make a solution to it:</p>

<pre><code>from automain import *  # will only import the automain decorator

@automain
def mymain():
    print 'this is our main function'
</code></pre>

<p>The <a href="http://slowchop.com/2011/01/25/automain/" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> explains it, and the <a href="https://github.com/gak/automain" rel="nofollow">code is on github</a> and can be easy_installed:</p>

<pre><code>easy_install automain
</code></pre>
