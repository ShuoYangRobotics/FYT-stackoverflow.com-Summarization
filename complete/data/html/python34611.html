<h3>Question (ID-34611):</h3><h2>What's the best toolkit for doing 2d game programming with Python?</h2><p>What's the best toolkit for doing 2d game programming with Python?  I've heard of pygame but is there anything I should add to it or is there another group of modules that surpasses it?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-9):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I use <a href="http://www.pygame.org/news.html" rel="nofollow">pygame</a> myself and it is very good. It has good documentation and tutorials, and is quite well designed. I've also heard wonderful reviews of <a href="http://www.pyglet.org/" rel="nofollow">pyglet</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><a href="http://codeboje.de/2d-game-engines-python/" rel="nofollow">A blog post covering several of the alternatives</a>, including <a href="http://www.pygame.org/" rel="nofollow">PyGame</a>, <a href="http://www.farbs.org/pycap.html" rel="nofollow">PyCap</a>, <a href="http://www.suda-chen.biz/?page_id=9" rel="nofollow">SpriteCraft</a>, and <a href="http://ika.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">ika</a>. I have also seen <a href="http://www.pyglet.org/" rel="nofollow">pyglet</a> mentioned.</p>

<p>You may also want to look at <a href="http://panda3d.org/" rel="nofollow">Panda</a>, which is a very easy to use 3D engine with Python bindings. It is used for rapid prototyping at <a href="http://www.etc.cmu.edu/" rel="nofollow">Carnegie Mellon's ETC</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I have used and would highly recommend <a href="http://www.pyglet.org" rel="nofollow">pyglet</a>, which provides 2D sprite graphics, hooks into OpenGL effects, audio support, file asset management, and excellent text layout and display support (not something you always find in a 2D game library). The API is sane, well-documented, and easy to get started with, and goes deep (especially if you're an OpenGL wizard).</p>

<p>As a companion to pyglet, I have used and would also suggest <a href="http://cocos2d.org/" rel="nofollow">Cocos2D</a>, which adds scene management, improved sprites, tiled map support, and fancy (accelerated) effects to add a little polish. Cocos is still young, but taking shape quickly, and already has fairly solid documentation.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I think pygame is the standard for game development in Python, I don't know of any others.  A book you may be interested in is <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1592000770" rel="nofollow">Game Programming with Python, Lua, and Ruby</a>.  Not only does it cover Python (and, I believe, the pygame module), but it also gives you exposure to Lua and Ruby.  It's also available on <a href="http://books24x7.com" rel="nofollow">books24x7</a> if you have a subscription there.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Another option is <a href="http://www.farbs.org/pycap.html" rel="nofollow">pycap</a> which is a wrapper for the popcap framework with Python.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>If you're already familiar with using OpenGL in another language (probably C or C++) then <a href="http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">PyOpenGL</a> is awesome. I was surprised as to how easy it was to switch from OpenGL/C to OpenGL/Python. The performance isn't half bad either.</p>

<p>I've heard good things about PyGame and Pyglet though I must admit I haven't really done much messing around with either one.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I've only heard people talk about pygame.  It has tons of followers &amp; plenty of functionality.</p>

<p>Recently I saw <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1590598725" rel="nofollow">this book</a> at barnes &amp; noble which I might check out one day.  It looked good.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>pyGame is impressive</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>A followup question:</p>

<p>Can't I just code a simple 2D game inside some existing graphic/windowing toolkit like the excellent wxPython ? </p>

<p>I will benefit from the ready-made GUI widgets that can wrap the graphics in my game, while with pyGame I have to develop those myself.</p>
