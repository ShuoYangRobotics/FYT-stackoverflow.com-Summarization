<h3>Question (ID-2459329):</h3><h2>How to determine if the variable is a function in Python?</h2><p>Since functions are values in Python, how do I determine if the variable is a function?</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>boda = len   # boda is the length function now
if ?is_var_function(boda)?:
  print "Boda is a function!"
else:
  print "Boda is not a function!"
</code></pre>

<p>Here hypothetical <code>?is_var_function(x)?</code> should return true if <code>x</code> is a callable function, and false if it is not.</p>

<p>Please advise!</p>

<p>Thanks, Boda Cydo.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You may use <code>inspect.isfunction(object)</code>. See: <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/inspect.html" rel="nofollow">docs.python.org</a></p>

<p>That said, you should avoid using this technique in your day-to-day code. Sometimes you actually need to use reflection - for example, an MVC framework might need to load a class and inspect its members. But usually you should return/pass/deal with objects that have the same "interface". For example, do not return an object that may be an integer or a function - always return the same "type" of object so your code can be consistent.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The <code>callable</code> built-in mentioned in other answers doesn't answer your question as posed, because it also returns <code>True</code>, besides functions, for methods, classes, instances of classes which define a <code>__call__</code> method.  If your question's title and text are wrong, and you don't care if something is in fact a function but only if it's <em>callable</em>, then use that builtin.  But the best answer to your question as posed is: import the <code>inspect</code> method of Python's standard library, and use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/inspect.html?highlight=inspect#inspect.isfunction" rel="nofollow">inspect.isfunction</a>.  (There are other, lower-abstraction ways, but it's always a good idea to use functionality of the <code>inspect</code> module for introspection when it's there, in preference to lower-level approaches: <code>inspect</code> helps keep your code concise, clear, robust, and future-proof).</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>There is a <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html?highlight=callable#callable" rel="nofollow">callable</a> function in python.</p>

<pre><code> if callable(boda):
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Use <code>callable(boda)</code> to determine whether <code>boda</code> is callable or not. </p>

<p>Callable means here being a function, method or even a class. But since you want to distinguish only between variables and functions it should work nicely.</p>

<p>Your code would then look like:</p>

<pre><code>boda = len   # boda is the length function now
if callable(boda):
  print "Boda is a function!"
else:
  print "Boda is not a function!"
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import types
&gt;&gt;&gt; def f(): pass
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(f) == types.FunctionType
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(x) == types.FunctionType
False
</code></pre>

<p>That will check if it's a function. <code>callable()</code> will check if it's callable (that is, it has a <code>__call__</code> method), so it will return true on a class as well as a function or method.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>It's not a 100% perfect solution, but you might want to check out the "callable" built-in function:</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html</a></p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>And what should it return for a <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#property" rel="nofollow">property</a>, which you access like a value attribute but actually invokes a function?  Your seemingly simple question actually opens up a whole can of worms in Python.  Which means things like <code>callable</code> and <code>isfunction</code> are good to know about for your education and introspection, but are probably not things you want to rely on when interfacing with other code.</p>

<p>Tangentially: See the <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2010/conference/schedule/event/107/" rel="nofollow">Turtles All The Way Down</a> presentation for more on how Python is put together.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>The philosophy of how to use different objects in a Python program is called <em>duck typing</em>—if it looks like a duck, quacks like duck, and walks like a duck, it's a duck. Objects are grouped not by what their type is but what they are capable of doing, and this even extends to functions. When writing a Python program, you should always know what all your objects can do and use them without checking.</p>

<p>For example, I could define a function</p>

<pre><code>def add_three(a, b c):
    return a + b + c
</code></pre>

<p>and mean for it to be used with three floats. But by not checking this, I have a much more useful function—I can use it with ints, with decimal.Decimals, or with fractions.Fractions, for example.</p>

<p>The same applies to having a function. If I know I have a function and want to call it, I should just call it. Maybe what I have is a function and maybe I have a different callable (like a bound method or an instance of an arbitrary class that defines <code>__call__</code>) that could be just as good. By not checking anything, I make my code able to handle a wide range of circumstances I might not even have thought of in advance.</p>

<p>In the case of callables, I can pretty reliably determine whether I have one or not, but for the sake of my code's simplicity, I shouldn't want to. If someone passes in something that's not callable, you'll get an error when you call it anyways. If I'm writing code that accepts a parameter that may be a callable or not and I do different things depending on it, it sounds like I should improve my API by defining two functions to do these two different things.</p>

<p>If you did have a way to handle the case where the caller passed in something that isn't function-like (and this wasn't just the result of an insane API), the right solution would be to catch the <code>TypeError</code> that is raised when you try to call something that can't be called. In general, it's better to try to do something and recover if it fails rather than to check ahead of time. (Recall the cliché, "It's easier to ask forgiveness than permission.") Checking ahead of time can lead to unexpected problems based on subtle errors in logic and can lead to race conditions.</p>

<p>Why do you think you need to typecheck?</p>
