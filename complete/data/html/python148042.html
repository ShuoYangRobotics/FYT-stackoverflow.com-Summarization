<h3>Question (ID-148042):</h3><h2>Using OR comparisons with IF statements</h2><p>When using IF statements in Python, you have to do the following to make the "cascade" work correctly.</p>

<pre><code>if job == "mechanic" or job == "tech":
        print "awesome"
elif job == "tool" or job == "rock":
        print "dolt"
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a way to make Python accept multiple values when checking for "equals to"? For example,</p>

<pre><code>if job == "mechanic" or "tech":
    print "awesome"
elif job == "tool" or "rock":
    print "dolt"
</code></pre>

<p>The values in parentheses are a tuple. The <code>in</code> operator checks to see whether the left hand side item occurs somewhere inside the right handle tuple.</p>

<p>Note that when Python searches a tuple or list using the <code>in</code> operator, it does a linear search. If you have a large number of items on the right hand side, this could be a performance bottleneck. A larger-scale way of doing this would be to use a <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/types-set.html" rel="nofollow"><code>frozenset</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>AwesomeJobs = frozenset(["mechanic", "tech", ... lots of others ])
def func():
    if job in AwesomeJobs:
        print "awesome"
</code></pre>

<p>The use of <code>frozenset</code> over <code>set</code> is preferred if the list of awesome jobs does not need to be changed during the operation of your program.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You can use in:</p>

<pre><code>if job  in ["mechanic", "tech"]:
    print "awesome"
</code></pre>

<p>When checking very large numbers, it may also be worth storing off a set of the items to check, as this will be faster.  Eg.</p>

<pre><code>AwesomeJobs = set(["mechanic", "tech", ... lots of others ])
...

def func():
    if job in AwesomeJobs:
        print "awesome"
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><pre><code>if job in ("mechanic", "tech"):
    print "awesome"
elif job in ("tool", "rock"):
    print "dolt"
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>While I don't think you can do what you want directly, one alternative is:</p>

<pre><code>if job in [ "mechanic", "tech" ]:
    print "awesome"
elif job in [ "tool", "rock" ]:
    print "dolt"
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Tuples with constant items are stored themselves as constants in the compiled function. They can be loaded with a single instruction. Lists and sets on the other hand, are always constructed anew on each execution.</p>

<p>Both tuples and lists use linear search for the in-operator. Sets uses a hash-based look-up, so it will be faster for a larger number of options.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>In other languages I'd use a switch/select statement to get the job done. <a href="http://simonwillison.net/2004/May/7/switch/" rel="nofollow">You can do that in python too</a>.</p>
