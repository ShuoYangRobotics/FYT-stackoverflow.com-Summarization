<h3>Question (ID-6982949):</h3><h2>Output formatting in Python: replacing several %s with the same variable</h2><p>I'm trying to maintain/update/rewrite/fix a bit of Python that looks a bit like this:</p>

<pre><code>variable = """My name is %s and it has been %s since I was born.
              My parents decided to call me %s because they thought %s was a nice name.
              %s is the same as %s.""" % (name, name, name, name, name, name)
</code></pre>

<p>There are little snippets that look like this all over the script, and I was wondering whether there's a simpler (more Pythonic?) way to write this code. I've found one instance of this that replaces the same variable about 30 times, and it just feels ugly.</p>

<p>Is the only way around the (in my opinion) ugliness to split it up into lots of little bits?</p>

<pre><code>variable = """My name is %s and it has been %s since I was born.""" % (name, name)
variable += """My parents decided to call me %s because they thought %s was a nice name.""" % (name, name)
variable += """%s is the same as %s.""" % (name, name)

<pre><code>var = '%(foo)s %(foo)s %(foo)s' % { 'foo': 'look_at_me_three_times' }
</code></pre>

<p>Or <code>format</code> with explicit numbering.</p>

<pre><code>var = '{0} {0} {0}'.format('look_at_meeee')
</code></pre>

<p>Well, or <code>format</code> with named parameters.</p>

<pre><code>var = '{foo} {foo} {foo}'.format(foo = 'python you so crazy')
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; "%(name)s %(name)s hello!" % dict(name='foo')
'foo foo hello!'
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You could use named parameters. <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/string.html#format-examples" rel="nofollow">See examples here</a></p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Use the new <code>string.format</code>:</p>

<pre><code>name = 'Alex'
variable = """My name is {0} and it has been {0} since I was born.
          My parents decided to call me {0} because they thought {0} was a nice name.
          {0} is the same as {0}.""".format(name)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><pre><code>variable = """My name is {0} and it has been {0} since I was born.
              My parents decided to call me {0} because they thought {0} was a nice name.
              {0} is the same as {0}.""".format(name)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Use formatting strings:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; variable = """My name is {name} and it has been {name} since..."""
&gt;&gt;&gt; n = "alex"
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; variable.format(name=n)
'My name is alex and it has been alex since...'
</code></pre>

<p>The text within the {} can be a descriptor or an index value.</p>

<p>Another fancy trick is to use a dictionary to define multiple variables in combination with the ** operator.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; values = {"name": "alex", "color": "red"}
&gt;&gt;&gt; """My name is {name} and my favorite color is {color}""".format(**values)
'My name is alex and my favorite color is red'
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
