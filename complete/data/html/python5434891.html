<h3>Question (ID-5434891):</h3><h2>Iterate a list as pair (current, next) in Python</h2><p>I sometimes need to iterate a list in python looking at the "current" element and the "next" element. I have, till now, done so with code like:</p>

<pre><code>for current, next in zip(the_list, the_list[1:]):
    # do something
</code></pre>

<p>This works and does what I expect -- just wondering if there's a more idiomatic or efficient way to do the same thing.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Here's a relevant example from the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/itertools.html#recipes" rel="nofollow">itertools</a> module docs:</p>

<pre><code>def pairwise(iterable):
    "s -&gt; (s0,s1), (s1,s2), (s2, s3), ..."
    a, b = tee(iterable)
    next(b, None)
    return izip(a, b)
</code></pre>

<p>How this works:</p>

<p>First, two parallel iterators, <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are created (the <code>tee()</code> call), both pointing to the first element of the original iterable. The second iterator, <code>b</code> is moved 1 step  forward (the <code>next(b, None)</code>) call). At this point <code>a</code> points to s0 and <code>b</code> points to s1. Both <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> can traverse the original iterator independently - the izip function takes the two iterators and makes pairs of the returned elements, advancing both iterators at the same pace.</p>

<p>One caveat: the <code>tee()</code> function produces two iterators that can advance independently of each other, but it comes at a cost. If one of the iterators advances further than the other,  then <code>tee()</code>  needs to keep the consumed elements in memory until the second iterator comsumes them too (it cannot 'rewind' the original iterator). Here it doesn't matter because one iterator is only 1 step ahead of the other, but in general it's easy to use a lot of memory this way.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Since <code>the_list[1:]</code> actually creates a copy of the whole list (excluding its first element), and <code>zip()</code> creates a list of tuples immediately when called,  in total three copies of your list are created.  If your list is very large, you might prefer</p>

<pre><code>from itertools import izip, islice
for current, next in izip(the_list, islice(the_list, 1, None)):
    # whatever
</code></pre>

<p>which does not copy the list at all.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>This should do the same thing:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python
the_list = [1,2,3,4]
for i in range(1, len(the_list)):
    current, next = the_list[i-1], the_list[i]
    print current, next
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Check MizardX answer for <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/323750/how-to-access-previous-next-element-while-for-looping">this question</a>. But i don't think this solution is more idiomatic than yours.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>A basic solution:</p>

<pre><code>def neighbors( list ):
  i = 0
  while i + 1 &lt; len( list ):
    yield ( list[ i ], list[ i + 1 ] )
    i += 1

for ( x, y ) in neighbors( list ):
  print( x, y )
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><pre><code>code = '0016364ee0942aa7cc04a8189ef3'
# Getting the current and next item
print  [code[idx]+code[idx+1] for idx in range(len(code)-1)]
# Getting the pair
print  [code[idx*2]+code[idx*2+1] for idx in range(len(code)/2)]
</code></pre>
