<h3>Question (ID-2032462):</h3><h2>Python Code Snippets</h2><p>Is there any online resource or a book that provides common code snippets? I really like the "<a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0672329107" rel="nofollow">Python Phrasebook</a>", but it doesn't cover Python 3.1.</p>

<p>I'd appreciate your comments and advices. Thanks!</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The Python <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/langs/python/" rel="nofollow">Cookbook</a> (also available in <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596007973" rel="nofollow">book form</a> -- more date but with lots of selection, editing, expanded discussion, etc -- I'm biased towards the latter of course) may be similar to what you ask, except it doesn't just provide "snippets", but also explanations of the problems being tackled, discussion of alternatives, explanations of why one approach may be preferable to another, and so on.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You might like <a href="http://diveintopython3.ep.io/" rel="nofollow">Dive Into Python 3</a>. It's an online book that has lots of useful snippets.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Read <a href="http://docs.python.org/3.1/tutorial/index.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> tutorial for Python 3.1.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Found <a href="http://snipplr.com/all/language/python" rel="nofollow">this</a> Python code snippet collection (23 pages). Some of those aren't compatible with v3.x but still a pretty helpful.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Try looking at Acire by Jono Bacon (canonical/ubuntu developer)</p>

<p>Jono's Acire tool is very useful allows contributors of snippets.
You can write and test your code samples all inside of Acire but
you can use any of the 200 python snippets already contributed.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>If you are starting out in Python development, it may be a good idea to start with Python 2.5 or 2.x (x being the latest version). This is because Python 3.x is not backwards compatible with 2.x version and you are better of learning the fundamentals from 2.x and then learning whats different in 3.x.</p>
