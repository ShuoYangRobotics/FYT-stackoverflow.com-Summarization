<h3>Question (ID-3018758):</h3><h2>Determine precision and scale of particular number in Python</h2><p>I have a variable in Python containing a floating point number (e.g. <code>num = 24654.123</code>), and I'd like to determine the number's precision and scale values (in the Oracle sense), so 123.45678 should give me (8,5), 12.76 should give me (4,2), etc.</p>

<p>I was first thinking about using the string representation (via <code>str</code> or <code>repr</code>), but those fail for large numbers (although I understand now it's the limitations of floating point representation that's the issue here):</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; num = 1234567890.0987654321
&gt;&gt;&gt; str(num) = 1234567890.1
&gt;&gt;&gt; repr(num) = 1234567890.0987654
</code></pre>

<p><b>Edit:</b></p>

<p>Good points below. I should clarify. The number is already a float and is being pushed to a database via cx_Oracle. I'm trying to do the best I can in Python to handle floats that are too large for the corresponding database type short of executing the INSERT and handling Oracle errors (because I want to deal with the numbers a field, not a record, at a time). I guess <code>map(len, repr(num).split('.'))</code> is the closest I'll get to the precision and scale of the float?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I think you should consider using the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/decimal.html" rel="nofollow">decimal</a> type instead of a <code>float</code>. The <code>float</code> type will give rounding errors because the numbers are represented internally in binary but many decimal numbers don't have an exact binary representation.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Not possible with floating point variables. For example, typing </p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 10.2345
</code></pre>

<p>gives:</p>

<pre><code>10.234500000000001
</code></pre>

<p>So, to get 6,4 out of this, you will have to find a way to distinguish between a user entering <code>10.2345</code> and <code>10.234500000000001</code>, which is impossible using floats. This has to do with the way floating point numbers are stored. Use <code>decimal</code>.</p>

<pre><code>import decimal
a = decimal.Decimal('10.234539048538495')
&gt;&gt;&gt; str(a)
'10.234539048538495'
&gt;&gt;&gt;  (len(str(a))-1, len(str(a).split('.')[1]))
(17,15)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>(0) Please confirm or deny: You are given floats to use, this is unavoidable, you can't get your data as decimal, the Oracle datatypes include decimal-based types, and this fundamental mismatch is unavoidable. Please explain any full or partial denial. </p>

<p>(1) Your "fail for large numbers" remark is misleading/irrelevant/wrong -- you say that your starting point is a float, but 1234567890.0987654321 can't be represented as a float, as shown by the result of repr().</p>

<p>(2) Perhaps you could use the NEW repr (Python 2.7 and 3.1) which provides the minimum possible precision of repr(x) that still satisfies <code>float(repr(x)) == x</code></p>

<p>E.g. old repr(1.1) produces "1.1000000000000001", new repr(1.1) produces "1.1"</p>

<p>About "I guess map(len, repr(num).split('.')) is the closest I'll get to the precision and scale of the float?": You need a strategy to handle (a) negative and zero numbers (b) numbers like <code>1.1e20</code></p>

<p>Digging in Objects/floatobject.c should turn up the C code for the new repr() of a float object, should you need to use Python 2.6 or earlier.</p>

<p>(3) Perhaps if you told us the specs for the relevant Oracle data types, we could help you devise checks for choosing which type can contain a given float value.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p><a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/floatingpoint.html" rel="nofollow">Basically, you can't with floating point numbers.</a>   Using the decimal type would help and if you want really large precision, consider using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gmpy/" rel="nofollow"><code>gmpy</code></a>, the GNU Multiple Precision library's port to Python.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Getting the number of digits to the left of the decimal point is easy:</p>

<pre><code>int(log10(x))+1
</code></pre>

<p>The number of digits to the right of the decimal point is trickier, because of the inherent inaccuracy of floating point values. I'll need a few more minutes to figure that one out.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Based on that principle, here's the complete code.</p>

<pre><code>import math

def precision_and_scale(x):
    max_digits = 14
    int_part = int(abs(x))
    magnitude = 1 if int_part == 0 else int(math.log10(int_part)) + 1
    if magnitude &gt;= max_digits:
        return (magnitude, 0)
    frac_part = abs(x) - int_part
    multiplier = 10 ** (max_digits - magnitude)
    frac_digits = multiplier + int(multiplier * frac_part + 0.5)
    while frac_digits % 10 == 0:
        frac_digits /= 10
    scale = int(math.log10(frac_digits))
    return (magnitude + scale, scale)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>seems like <code>str</code> is better choice than <code>repr</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; r=10.2345678
&gt;&gt;&gt; r
10.234567800000001
&gt;&gt;&gt; repr(r)
'10.234567800000001'
&gt;&gt;&gt; str(r)
'10.2345678'
</code></pre>
