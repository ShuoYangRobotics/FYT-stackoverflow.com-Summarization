<h3>Question (ID-3765178):</h3><h2>Running python on a Windows machine vs Linux</h2><p>I am interested in learning python but my linux skills suck. i would like to develop a medium to large scale web application using python and django but afraid the software may not work well on a windows box. Is there a performance difference in running python on linux vs windows. Is there anything that I should watch out for when developing the application. Also, I am aware that it is very easy integrating C++ libraries with python. Is this statement still true is the code is on a windows box?</p>

<p>Also, if you have a better way to ask this question please feel free to edit the title and description</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Don't tell anybody this, but I've run python/django on windows. It works all right and the performance hit isn't any worse than you would expect from windows. I used MySQL and it installed without a problem. I had to grope around to find out how to manage it (no good ol' <code>sudo /etc/init.d/mysql restart</code> but i eventually found a graphical interface to do what I needed.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I've been working Py on both Windows and Linux. I favor Linux because of several things:</p>

<ol>
<li>virtualenvs - once you start working with virtualenvs, there is no turning back.</li>
<li>SHELL - CMD is very frustrating when executing python/management commands in django. Also, you should add python.exe every time :).</li>
<li>ipython works better on Linux.</li>
<li>GeoDjango doesn't work on Vista/7 last time i checked. I spent 3 days trying to set it up. Just for comparison, i set GeoDjango-able development environment in 20 minutes in Linux.</li>
<li>Linux is free :)</li>
<li>Although there is no visible performance impact or incompatibility when working python cross-platform, the benefits of Linux for python development outweigh Windows by a lot. It's  a lot more comfortable and definitely will boost your productivity.</li>

</ol>

<p>IMHO Linux is the smart choice for Python development.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Shouldn't be a problem. Some people even host Python+Django on Windows.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><ol>
<li><p>Which software are you affraid will not work on windows, the actual web app or your development enviroment. If you mean the IDE, then I wouldn't worry about that there are very good python IDEs for windows, as for the webapp that's another discussion all together</p></li>
<li><p>The statement that "it is very easy integrating C++ libs with python" is not accurate, there are many ways of doing it and they are not all easy, I have personally only tried SWIG, but there are many other alternatives (for example Boost.Python), whoever I wouldn't believe it is as easy to get up and running with some of these tools on a windows enviromeny with out something like mingw or cygwin as at least SWIG is built with *nix in mind</p></li>

<p>Your software will work.  The Windows OS may not work as you hope.  But that's Windows, not Python.</p>

<p>We develop 100% on Windows.  We completely test: Unit test, integration test and user acceptance test on Windows.  100%.</p>

<p>We deploy for production 0% on Windows, 100% on Linux.</p>

<p>We have a few (less than 6) differences in the unit tests that are Windows-specific.  </p>

<p>The application has no changes.  It works with Apache or not.  It works with SQLite or MySQL.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Python program is very easily portable. Most of the time your code will work on any platform that have the appropriate version of python.</p>

<p>One point to be aware of though, is file path handling. Linux, Windows, Macs, etc uses different path schemes, so you shouldn't be handling them as strings; instead use os.path functions to join, split, etc.</p>

<p>There is ultimately some slight performance difference with regard to timing, threading, processing, I/O, but they're nothing to worry about.</p>

<p>Integrating Python and C++ is easy; the only problem is in the C++ side, i.e. you will have to recompile the C++ code.</p>
