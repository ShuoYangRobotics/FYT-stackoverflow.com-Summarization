<h3>Question (ID-1093598):</h3><h2>pyserial - How to Read Last Line Sent from Serial Device</h2><p>So I have an Arduino connected to my Windows XP computer.  It's just running a loop, sending a value over the serial port back to the computer every 100ms.  </p>

<p>I want to make a Python script that will read from the serial port only every few seconds, so I want it to just see the last thing sent from the Arduino.</p>

<p>How do you do this in Pyserial?</p>

<p>Here's the code I tried which does't work.  It reads the lines sequentially.</p>

<pre><code>import serial
import time

ser = serial.Serial('com4',9600,timeout=1)
while 1:
    time.sleep(10)
    print ser.readline() #how to get most recent line sent from device?

<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Perhaps I'm misunderstanding your question, but as it's a serial line, you'll have to read everything sent from the Arduino sequentially - it'll be buffered up in the Arduino until you read it.</p>

<p>If you want to have a status display which shows the latest thing sent - use a thread which incorporates the code in your question (minus the sleep), and keep the last complete line read as the latest line from the Arduino.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <code>mtasic</code>'s example code is quite good, but if the Arduino has sent a partial line when <code>inWaiting()</code> is called, you'll get a truncated line. Instead, what you want to do is to put the last <em>complete</em> line into <code>last_received</code>, and keep the partial line in <code>buffer</code> so that it can be appended to the next time round the loop. Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>def receiving(ser):
    global last_received

    buffer = ''
    while True:
        buffer = buffer + ser.read(ser.inWaiting())
        if '\n' in buffer:
            lines = buffer.split('\n') # Guaranteed to have at least 2 entries
            last_received = lines[-2]
            #If the Arduino sends lots of empty lines, you'll lose the
            #last filled line, so you could make the above statement conditional
            #like so: if lines[-2]: last_received = lines[-2]
            buffer = lines[-1]
</code></pre>

<p>Regarding use of <code>readline()</code>: Here's what the Pyserial documentation has to say (slightly edited for clarity):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Be careful when using "readline". Do
  specify a timeout when opening the
  serial port, otherwise it could block
  forever if no newline character is
  received. Also note that "readline"
  only works with a timeout. It
  depends on having a timeout and
  interprets that as EOF (end of file).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which seems quite reasonable to me!</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>These solutions will hog the CPU while waiting for characters.</p>

<p>You should do at least one blocking call to read(1)</p>

<pre><code>while True:
    if '\n' in buffer: 
        pass # skip if a line already in buffer
    else:
        buffer += ser.read(1)  # this will block until one more char or timeout
    buffer += ser.read(ser.inWaiting()) # get remaining buffered chars
</code></pre>

<p>...and do the split thing as before.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><pre><code>from serial import *
from threading import Thread

last_received = ''

def receiving(ser):
    global last_received
    buffer = ''

    while True:
        # last_received = ser.readline()
        buffer += ser.read(ser.inWaiting())
        if '\n' in buffer:
            last_received, buffer = buffer.split('\n')[-2:]

if __name__ ==  '__main__':
    ser = Serial(
        port=None,
        baudrate=9600,

    )

    Thread(target=receiving, args=(ser,)).start()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You will need a loop to read everything sent, with the last call to readline() blocking until the timeout.  So:</p>

<pre><code>def readLastLine(ser):
    last_data=''
    while True:
        data=ser.readline()
        if data!='':
            last_data=data
        else:
            return last_data
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Slight modification to mtasic &amp; Vinay Sajip's code:</p>

<p>While I found this code quite helpful to me for a similar application, I needed <em>all</em> the lines coming back from a serial device that would send information periodically.</p>

<p>I opted to pop the first element off the top, record it, and then rejoin the remaining elements as the new buffer and continue from there.</p>

<p>I realize that this is <strong>not</strong> what Greg was asking for, but I thought it was worth sharing as a side note.</p>

<pre><code>def receiving(ser):
    global last_received

    buffer = ''
    while True:
        buffer = buffer + ser.read(ser.inWaiting())
        if '\n' in buffer:
            lines = buffer.split('\n')
            last_received = lines.pop(0)

            buffer = '\n'.join(lines)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>For the benefit of people looking for answers to this: </p>

<p>Using .inWaiting() inside an infinite loop may be problematic. Its may hog up the entire cpu depending on the implementation. Instead I would recommend using a specific size of data to be read. So in this case the following should be done for example: </p>

<pre><code>ser.read(1024)
</code></pre>
