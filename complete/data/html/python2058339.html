<h3>Question (ID-2058339):</h3><h2>Awk, bash or python for converting a regular file?</h2><p>I have a text file with lots of lines and with this structure:</p>

<pre><code>[('name_1a',
'name_1b',
value_1),
('name_2a',
'name_2b',
value_2),
.....
.....
('name_XXXa',
'name_XXXb',
value_XXX)]
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to convert it to:</p>

<pre><code>name_1a, name_1b, value_1
name_2a, name_2b, value_2
......
name_XXXa, name_XXXb, value_XXX
</code></pre>

<p>I wonder what would be the best way, whether awk, python or bash.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Jose</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Tried evaluating it python? Looks like a list of tuples to me.</p>

<pre><code>eval(your_string)
</code></pre>

<p>Note, it's massively unsafe! If there's code in there to delete your hard disk, evaluating it will run that code!</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I would like to use Python:</p>

<pre><code>lines = open('filename.txt','r').readlines()
n = len(lines) # n % 3 == 0
for i in range(0,n,3):
    name1 = lines[i].strip("',[]\n\r")
    name2 = lines[i+1].strip("',[]\n\r")
    value = lines[i+2].strip("',[]\n\r")
    print name1,name2,value
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>It looks like legal Python. You might be able to just import it as a module and then write it back out after formatting it. </p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Oh boy, here is a job for <code>ast.literal_eval</code>:
(<code>literal_eval</code> is safer than <code>eval</code>, since it restricts the input string to literals such as strings, numbers, tuples, lists, dicts, booleans and None:</p>

<pre><code>import ast
filename='in'
with open(filename,'r') as f:
    contents=f.read()
    data=ast.literal_eval(contents)

for elt in data:
    print(', '.join(map(str,elt)))
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>here's one way to do it with (g)awk</p>

<pre><code>$ awk -vRS=")," ' { gsub(/\n|[\047\]\[)(]/,"") } 1' file
name_1a,name_1b,value_1
name_2a,name_2b,value_2
name_XXXa,name_XXXb,value_XXX
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Awk is typically line oriented, and bash is a shell, with limited numbrer of string manipulation functions.  It really depends on where your strength as a programmer lies, but all other things being equal, I would choose <strong>python</strong>.</p>

<p>Did you ever consider that by redirecting the time it took to post this on SO, you could have had it done?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"AWK is a language for processing
  files of text. A file is treated as a
  sequence of records, and by default
  each line is a record. Each line is
  broken up into a sequence of fields,
  so we can think of the first word in a
  line as the first field, the second
  word as the second field, and so on.
  An AWK program is of a sequence of
  pattern-action statements. AWK reads
  the input a line at a time. A line is
  scanned for each pattern in the
  program, and for each pattern that
  matches, the associated action is
  executed." - Alfred V. Aho[2]</p>

<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Asking what's the best language for doing a given task is a very different question to say, asking: 'what's the best way of doing a given task in a particular language'. The first, what you're asking, is in most cases entirely subjective.</p>

<p>Since this is a fairly simple task, I would suggest going with what you know (unless you're doing this for learning purposes, which I doubt).<br>
 If you know any of the languages you suggested, go ahead and solve this in a matter of minutes. If you know none of them, now enters the subjective part, I would suggest learning Python, since it's so much more fun than the other 2 ;)</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>If the values are legal python values, you can take advantage of eval() since your data is a legal python data sucture. The following would work if values are integers, otherwise you might have to massage the print call a bit:</p>

<pre><code>input = """[('name_1a',
          'name_1b',
          1),
         ('name_2a',
          'name_2b',
          2),
         ('name_XXXa',
          'name_XXXb',
          3)]"""

for e in eval(input):
    print '%s,%s,%d' % e
</code></pre>

<p>P.S. using eval() is quite controversial since it will execute any valid python code that you pass into it, so take care.</p>
