<h3>Question (ID-7175020):</h3><h2>Python efficient way to check if very large string contains a substring</h2><p>Python is not my best language, and so I'm not all that good at finding the most efficient solutions to some of my problems. I have a very large string (coming from a 30 MB file) and I need to check if that file contains a smaller substring (this string is only a few dozen characters). The way I am currently doing it is:</p>

<pre><code>if small_string in large_string:
    # logic here
</code></pre>

<p>But this seems to be very inefficient because it will check every possible sequence of characters in the file. I know that there will only be an exact match on a newline, so would it be better to read the file in as a list and iterate through that list to match?</p>

<p>EDIT: To clear up some confusion on "matching on a newline only", here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>small_string = "This is a line"
big_string = "This is a line\nThis is another line\nThis is yet another"
</code></pre>

<p>If I'm not mistake, the in keyword will check all sequences, not just every line.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You can use one of these algorithms:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabin%E2%80%93Karp_string_search_algorithm" rel="nofollow">Rabin–Karp string search algorithm</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%E2%80%93Morris%E2%80%93Pratt_algorithm" rel="nofollow">Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm</a> (aka KMP) see an implementation <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/117214-knuth-morris-pratt-string-matching/" rel="nofollow">here</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Although I believe KMP is more efficient, it's more complicated to implement.The first link includes some pseudo-code that should make it very easy to implement in python.</p>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I do not see how to make it more optimal on the comparison, to be honest. But you can use less memory and lose less time with I/O if you read the file line by line:</p>

<pre><code>has_small_string = False
for line in large_file:
    if small_string in line:
        has_small_string = True
        break
if has_small_string:
   # ... Your stuff here ...
</code></pre>

<p>This is no revolutionary improvement, and can be even less useful if you <em>really</em> need the large string in the memory, but it <em>may</em> be helpful, so I am posting here :)</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Is it really slow? You're talking about 30MB string; let's try it with even bigger string:</p>

<pre><code>In [12]: string="agu82934u"*50*1024*1024+"string to be found"

In [13]: len(string)
Out[13]: 471859218

In [14]: %timeit "string to be found" in string
1 loops, best of 3: 335 ms per loop

In [15]: %timeit "string not to be found" in string
1 loops, best of 3: 200 ms per loop
</code></pre>

<p>I wouldn't say that 335 ms is much time looking for substring in 450MB string.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>If you just want to check if that substring exists,</p>

<pre><code>for line in open("file"):
    if substring in line:
         print "exists"
         sys.exit() # or break to do some other stuff
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Are you implying that only a complete line will match? (your EDIT: matching on a newline only example seems to)</p>

<p>Then I imagine</p>

<pre><code>for line in open('file').readlines():
  if line==small_string:
    return True
return False
</code></pre>

<p>IE,  using == is quicker than 'in' - perhaps. I wouldn't be surprised if the underlying implementation of in catches the case where the line to search and the string to search for are the same length and just attempts an == itself.</p>

<p>woudl be better.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I would rely on fast implementation by someone else:</p>

<pre><code>import subprocess
from subprocess import STDOUT
import os

...
with open(os.devnull, 'w') as devnull:
    if subprocess.call('grep %s "%s"' % (smallstring, file), shell=True, stdout=devnull, stderr=STDOUT) == 0:
        pass #do stuff
</code></pre>

<p>Won't work on windows.</p>

<p>edit: I'm worried taht grep returns 0 wheter it finds something or not. But I don't have any shell available to me now so I can't test it.</p>
