<h3>Question (ID-920645):</h3><h2>When to use While or the For in python</h2><p>Im currently finding problems in when should I use the <strong>While loop</strong> or the <strong>For loop</strong> in python. What looks like is that people prefer using the For loop (less code lines?), is there any specific situation wich I should use one or the other? Its a matter of personal preference? Or the codes I had read so far made me think wrong, and currently there are big differences beetween then?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Yes, there is a huge difference between while and for.</p>

<p>The <strong>for</strong> statement iterates through a collection or iterable object or generator function.</p>

<p>The <strong>while</strong> statement simply loops until a condition is False.</p>

<p>It isn't preference.  It's a question of what your data structures are.</p>

<p>Often, we represent the values we want to process as a <code>range</code> (an actual list), or <code>xrange</code> (which generates the values).  This gives us a data structure tailor-made for the <strong>for</strong> statement.</p>

<p>Generally, however, we have a ready-made collection: a set, tuple, list, map or even a string is already an iterable collection, so we simply use a <strong>for</strong> loop.</p>

<p>In a few cases, we might want some functional-programming processing done for us, in which case we can apply that transformation as part of iteration.  The <code>sorted</code> and <code>enumerate</code> functions apply a transformation on an iterable that fits naturally with the <strong>for</strong> statement.</p>

<p>If you don't have a tidy data structure to iterate through, or you don't have a generator function that drives your processing, you must use <strong>while</strong>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><code>while</code> is useful in scenarios where the break condition doesn't logically depend on any kind of sequence. For example, consider unpredictable interactions:</p>

<pre><code> while user_is_sleeping():
     wait()
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, you <em>could</em> write an appropriate iterator to encapsulate that action and make it accessible via <code>for</code> – but how would that serve readability?¹</p>

<p>In all other cases in Python, use <code>for</code> (or an appropriate higher-order function which encapsulate the loop).</p>

<p>¹ assuming the <code>user_is_sleeping</code> function returns <code>False</code> when false, the example code could be rewritten as the following <code>for</code> loop:</p>

<pre><code>for _ in iter(user_is_sleeping, False):
    wait()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>The <code>for</code> is the more pythonic choice for iterating a list since it is simpler and easier to read.</p>

<p>For example this:</p>

<pre><code>for i in range(11):
    print i
</code></pre>

<p>is much simpler and easier to read than this:</p>

<pre><code>i = 0
while i &lt;= 10:
    print i
    i = i + 1
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>First of all there are differences between the for loop in python and in other languages.
While in python it iterates over a list of values (eg: for value in [4,3,2,7]), in most other languages (C/C++, Java, PHP etc) it acts as a while loop, but easier to read.</p>

<p>For loops are generally used when the number of iterations is known (the length of an array for example), and while loops are used when you don't know how long it will take (for example the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble%5Fsort" rel="nofollow">bubble sort</a> algorithm which loops as long as the values aren't sorted)</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Consider processing iterables.  You can do it with a <code>for</code> loop:</p>

<pre><code>for i in mylist:
   print i
</code></pre>

<p>Or, you can do it with a <code>while</code> loop:</p>

<pre><code>it = mylist.__iter__()
while True:
   try:
      print it.next()
   except StopIteration:
      break
</code></pre>

<p>Both of those blocks of code do fundamentally the same thing in fundamentally the same way.  But the <code>for</code> loop hides the creation of the iterator and the handling of the <code>StopIteration</code> exception so that you don't need to deal with them yourself.</p>

<p>The only time I can think of that you'd use a <code>while</code> loop to handle an iterable would be if you needed to access the iterator directly for some reason, e.g. you needed to skip over items in the list under some circumstances.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>For loops usually make it clearer what the iteration is doing. You can't always use them directly, but most of the times the iteration logic with the while loop can be wrapped inside a generator func. For example:</p>

<pre><code>def path_to_root(node):
    while node is not None:
        yield node
        node = node.parent

for parent in path_to_root(node):
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of</p>

<pre><code>parent = node
while parent is not None:
    ...
    parent = parent.parent
</code></pre>
