<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Check out <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/" rel="nofollow">Django</a>. I would say it is the most comprehensive and easy to use python web framework.</p>

<p>They have a <a href="http://www.djangobook.com/en/2.0/" rel="nofollow">book</a> and <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/" rel="nofollow">tutorial</a> as well.</p>

<p>You might also like to visit <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/WebFrameworks" rel="nofollow">Python wiki</a> about web frameworks for more suggestions. But still, I highly recommend Django.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I've really enjoyed working with <a href="http://www.cherrypy.org/" rel="nofollow" title="CherryPy">CherryPy</a> in my project. Django had a little more of a CMS feel than I needed.  As a Python novice, CherryPy was very approachable to me. After several months of working with it, I often find interesting ways to use and extend it. Not sure how good a match it might be for your project, but it's at least worth checking out as an alternative to Django.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I've been working with <a href="http://pylonshq.com/" rel="nofollow">Pylons</a> for a while now and I highly recommend it.  Before using it I evaluated Django as well.  I found Pylons was a better fit due to how easy it was to customize and fit into my work flow.  Django seemed to be great for quickly starting projects, but I felt it was tough to make more complicated tasks work.  I've developed a task/inventory/contact management system with Pylons and I've been nothing but amazed with how quickly it's allowed me to develop and deploy.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>let's just get all the frameworks mentioned again.</p>

<p><a href="http://turbogears.org/" rel="nofollow">Turbogears</a></p>

<p><a href="http://bfg.repoze.org" rel="nofollow">bfg</a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.ianbicking.org/2010/03/12/a-webob-app-example/" rel="nofollow">webob</a></p>

<p><a href="http://web2py.com" rel="nofollow">web2py</a></p>

<p><a href="http://zope.org" rel="nofollow">zope</a></p>

<p><a href="http://grok.zope.org" rel="nofollow">grok</a></p>

<p>etc etc etc....</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I've never built web application with python-based framework but if I had to I would try <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/" rel="nofollow">Django</a><br>
I know people who worked with it and were very satisfied</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/" rel="nofollow">Django</a> is a great place to start since it is the most widely used web framework for Python. You could also look at <a href="http://pinaxproject.com/" rel="nofollow">Pinax</a> which is build off of Django. Pinax is typically used for rapid development. Its templates are great for that. <a href="http://webpy.org/" rel="nofollow">Web.py</a> is also another great Python web framework worth looking in to.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>I haven't used it but one of my co-workers has used the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/" rel="nofollow">Python Google Data API</a> and has said good things. Not positive of everything it can do but it might be helpful to you.</p>
