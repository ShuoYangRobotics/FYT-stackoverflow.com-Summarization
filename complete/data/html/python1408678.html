<h3>Question (ID-1408678):</h3><h2>Getting another program's output as input on the fly</h2><p>I've two programs I'm using in this way:</p>

<pre><code>$ c_program | python_program.py
</code></pre>

<p>c_program prints something using <code>printf()</code> and python_program.py reads using <code>sys.stdin.readline()</code>  </p>

<p>I'd like to make the python_program.py process c_program's output as it prints, immediately, so that it can print its own current output. Unfortunately python_program.py gets its input only after c_program ends.</p>

<p>How can I solve this? </p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Just set stdout to be line buffered at the beginning of your C program (before performing any output), like this:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
setvbuf(stdout, NULL, _IOLBF, 0);
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
setlinebuf(stdout);
</code></pre>

<p>Either one will work on Linux, but <code>setvbuf</code> is part of the C standard so it will work on more systems.</p>

<p>By default stdout will be block buffered for a pipe or file, or line buffered for a terminal.  Since stdout is a pipe in this case, the default will be block buffered.  If it is block buffered then the buffer will be flushed when it is full, or when you call <code>fflush(stdout)</code>.  If it is line buffered then it will be flushed automatically after each line.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>What you need is for your C program to call fflush(stdout) after every line.  For example, with the GNU grep tool, you can invoke the option '--line-buffered', which causes this behavior.  See <strong><a href="http://www.thinkage.ca/english/gcos/expl/nsc/lib/fflush.html" rel="nofollow">fflush</a></strong>.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If you can modify your C program, you've already received your <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1408678/getting-another-programs-output-as-input-on-the-fly/1408730#1408730">answer</a> but i thought i'd include a solution for those that can't/won't modify code.</p>

<p><a href="http://expect.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">expect</a> has an example script called <a href="http://expect.sourceforge.net/example/unbuffer.man.html" rel="nofollow">unbuffer</a> that will do the trick.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>All the Unix shells (that I know of) implement shell pipelines via something else than a pty
(typically, they use Unix pipes!-); therefore, the C/C++ runtime library in <code>cpp_program</code> will KNOW its output is NOT a terminal, and therefore it WILL buffer the output (in chunks of a few KB at a time). Unless you write your own shell (or semiquasimaybeshelloid) that implements pipelines via pyt's, I believe there is no way to do what you require using pipeline notation.</p>

<p>The "shelloid" thing in question might be written in Python (or in C, or Tcl, or...), using the <code>pty</code> module of the standard library or higher-level abstraction based on it such as <a href="http://pexpect.sourceforge.net/pexpect.html" rel="nofollow">pexpect</a>, and the fact that the two programs to be connected via a "pty-based pipeline" are written in C++ and Python is pretty irrelevant. The key idea is to trick the program to the left of the pipe into believing its stdout is a terminal (that's why a pty must be at the root of the trick) to fool its runtime library into NOT buffering output. Once you have written such a shelloid, you'd call it with some syntax such as:</p>

<p>$ shelloid 'cpp_program | python_program.py'</p>

<p>Of course it would be easier to provide a "point solution" by writing <code>python_program</code> in the knowledge that it must spawn <code>cpp_program</code> as a sub-process AND trick it into believing its stdout is a terminal (i.e., <code>python_program</code> would then directly use <code>pexpect</code>, for example). But if you have a million of such situations where you want to defeat the normal buffering performed by the system-provided C runtime library, or many cases in which you want to reuse existing filters, etc, writing <code>shelloid</code> might actually be preferable.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You may want to try <code>flush</code>ing the stdout stream in the cpp program.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>ok this maybe sound stupid but it might work:</p>

<p>output your pgm to a file</p>

<pre><code>$ c_program &gt;&gt; ./out.log
</code></pre>

<p>develop a python program that read from tail command</p>

<pre><code>import os

tailoutput = os.popen("tail -n 0 -f ./out.log")

try:
    while 1:
        line = tailoutput.readline()
        if len(line) == 0:
            break

        #do the rest of your things here
        print line

except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print "Quitting \n"
</code></pre>
