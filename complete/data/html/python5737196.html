<h3>Question (ID-5737196):</h3><h2>an expression for an infinite generator?</h2><p>Is there a straight forward generator expression that can yield infinite elements?</p>

<p>This is a purely theoretical question. No need for a "practical" answer here :)</p>

<hr>

<p>For example, it is easy to make a finite generator:</p>

<pre><code>my_gen = (0 for i in xrange(42))
</code></pre>

<p>However, to make an infinite one I need to "pollute" my namespace with a bogus function:</p>

<pre><code>def _my_gen():
    while True:
        yield 0
my_gen = _my_gen()
</code></pre>

<p>Doing things in a separate file and <code>import</code>-ing latter doesn't count.</p>

<hr>

<p>I also know that <code>itertools.repeat</code> does exactly this. Im curious if there is a one liner solution without that.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><pre><code>for x in iter(int, 1): pass
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Two-argument <code>iter</code> = zero-argument callable + sentinel value</li>
<li><code>int()</code> always returns <code>0</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, <code>iter(int, 1)</code> is an infinite iterator. There are obviously a huge number of variations on this particular theme (especially once you add <code>lambda</code> into the mix). One variant of particular note is <code>iter(f, object())</code>, as using a freshly created object as the sentinel value almost guarantees an infinite iterator regardless of the callable used as the first argument.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>None that doesn't internally use another infinite iterator defined as a class/function/generator (not -expression, a function with <code>yield</code>). A generator expression always draws from anoter iterable and does nothing but filtering and mapping its items. You can't go from finite items to infinite ones with only <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code>, you need <code>while</code> (or a <code>for</code> that doesn't terminate, which is exactly what we can't have using only <code>for</code> and finite iterators).</p>

<p>Trivia: <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3142/" rel="nofollow">PEP 3142</a> is superficially similar, but upon closer inspection it seems that it still requires the <code>for</code> clause (so no <code>(0 while True)</code> for you), i.e. only provides a shortcut for <code>itertools.takewhile</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><code>itertools</code> provides three infinite generators:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>count</code> : 1, 2, 3, 4, ...</p></li>
<li><p><code>cycle(p)</code>: p[0], p[1], ..., p[-1], p[0], ...</p></li>
<li><p><code>repeat(x)</code>: x, x, x, x, ...</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I don't know of any others in the standard library. </p>

<hr>

<p>Since you asked for a one-liner:</p>

<pre><code>__import__("itertools").count()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Maybe you could use decorators like this for example:</p>

<pre><code>def generator(first):
    def wrap(func):
        def seq():
            x = first
            while True:
                yield x
                x = func(x)
        return seq
    return wrap
</code></pre>

<p>Usage (1):</p>

<pre><code>@generator(0)
def blah(x):
    return x + 1

for i in blah():
    print i
</code></pre>

<p>Usage (2)</p>

<pre><code>for i in generator(0)(lambda x: x + 1)():
    print i
</code></pre>

<p>I think it could be further improved to get rid of those ugly <code>()</code>. However it depends on the complexity of the sequence that you wish to be able to create. Generally speaking if your sequence can be expressed using functions, than all the complexity and syntactic sugar of generators can be hidden inside a decorator or a decorator-like function.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Your OS may provide something that can be used as an infinite generator. Eg on linux</p>

<pre><code>for i in (0 for x in open('/dev/urandom')):
    print i
</code></pre>

<p>obviously this is not as efficient as </p>

<pre><code>for i in __import__('itertools').repeat(0)
    print i
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>you can iterate over a callable returning a constant always different than iter()'s sentinel</p>

<pre><code>g1=iter(lambda:0,1)
</code></pre>
