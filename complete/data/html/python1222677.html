<h3>Question (ID-1222677):</h3><h2>List Comprehensions in Python : efficient selection in a list</h2><p>Let's suppose that I have a list of elements, and I want to select only some of them, according to a certain function (for example a <em>distance</em> to an other element).</p>

<p>I want to have as a result a list of tuple, with the distance and the element. So, I wrote the following code</p>

<pre><code>result = [ ( myFunction(C), C) for C in originalList if myFunction(C) &lt; limit ]
</code></pre>

<p>But <code>myFunction</code> is a very time-consuming function, and the <code>originalList</code> quite big. So doing like that, <code>myFunction</code> will be call twice for every selected element.</p>

<p>So, is there a way to avoid this ??</p>

<p>I have two other possibilities, but they are not so good:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>the first one, is to create the
unfiltered list</p>

<pre><code>unfiltered = [ (myFunction(C),C) for C in originalList ]
</code></pre>

<p>and then sort it</p>

<pre><code>result = [ (dist,C) for dist,C in unfiltered if dist &lt; limit ]
</code></pre>

<p>but in that case, I duplicate my
<code>originalList</code> and waste some memory
(the list could be quite big - more
than 10,000 elements)</p></li>
<li><p>the second one is tricky and not very pythonic, but efficient (the best we can do, since the function should be evaluated once per element). <code>myFunction</code> stores it last<br />
result in a global variable (<code>lastResult</code> for example), and this value is re-used in the 
List comprehension </p>

<pre><code>result = [ (lastResult,C) for C in originalList if myFunction(C) &lt; limit ]
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>Do you have any better idea to achieve that, in an efficient and pythonic way ??</p>

<p>Thanks for your answers.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Sure, the difference between the following two:</p>

<pre><code>[f(x) for x in list]
</code></pre>

<p>and this:</p>

<pre><code>(f(x) for x in list)
</code></pre>

<p>is that the first will generate the list in memory, whereas the second is a new generator, with lazy evaluation.</p>

<p>So, simply write the "unfiltered" list as a generator instead. Here's your code, with the generator inline:</p>

<pre><code>def myFunction(x):
    print("called for: " + str(x))
    return x * x

originalList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
limit = 10
result =   [C2 for C2 in ((myFunction(C), C) for C in originalList) if C2[0] &lt; limit]
# result = [C2 for C2 in [(myFunction(C), C) for C in originalList] if C2[0] &lt; limit]
</code></pre>

<p>Note that you will not see a difference in the printout from the two, but if you were to look at memory usage, the second statement which is commented out, will use more memory.</p>

<p>To do a simple change to your code in your question, rewrite unfiltered as this:</p>

<pre><code>unfiltered = [ (myFunction(C),C) for C in originalList ]
             ^                                         ^
             +---------- change these to (..) ---------+
                                 |
                                 v
unfiltered = ( (myFunction(C),C) for C in originalList )
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Don't use a list comprehension; a normal for loop is fine here.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Just compute the distances beforehand and then filter the results:</p>

<pre><code>with_distances = ((myFunction(C), C) for C in originalList)
result = [C for C in with_distances if C[0] &lt; limit]
</code></pre>

<p>Note: instead of building a new list, I use a generator expression to build the distance/element pairs.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Lasse V. Karlsen has an excellent reply to your question.</p>

<p>If your distance computation is slow, I guess your elements are polylines, or something like that, right ?</p>

<p>There are lots of ways to make it faster :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If the distance between bounding boxes of objects is > X, then it follows that the distance between those objects is > X. So you only need to compute distance between bounding boxes.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want all objects that are at a distance less than X from object A, only objects whose bounding box intersect A's bounding box enlarged by X are potential matches.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Using the second point you can probably drop lots of candidate matches and only do the slow computation when needed.</p>

<p>Bounding boxes must be cached beforehand.</p>

<p>If you really have a lot of objects you could also use space partitioning...</p>

<p>Or convex enclosing polys if you are in 3D</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Rather than using a global variable as in your option 2, you could rely on the fact that in Python parameters are passed by object - that is, the object that is passed into your <code>myFunction</code> function is the <em>same</em> object as the one in the list (this isn't exactly the same thing as call by reference, but it's close enough).</p>

<p>So, if your myFunction set an attribute on the object - say, <code>_result</code> - you could filter by that attribute:</p>

<pre><code>result = [(_result, C) for C in originalList if myFunction(C) &lt; limit]
</code></pre>

<p>and your myFunction might look like this:</p>

<pre><code>def myFunction(obj):
    obj._result = ... calculation ....
    return obj._result
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>What's wrong with option 1?</p>

<p>"duplicate my originalList and waste some memory (the list could be quite big - more than 10,000 elements)"</p>

<p>10,000 elements is only 10,000 pointers to tuples that point to existing objects.  Think 160K or so of memory.  Hardly worth talking about.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Some options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization" rel="nofollow">memoization</a></li>
<li>Use a normal for loop</li>
<li>Create an unfiltered list, then filter it (your option 1). The 'wasted' memory will be reclaimed by the GC very quickly - it's not something you need to worry about.</li>
</ul>
