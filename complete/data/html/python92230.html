<h3>Question (ID-92230):</h3><h2>Python, beyond the basics</h2><p>I've gotten to grips with the basics of Python and I've got a small holiday which I want to use some of to learn a little more Python. The problem is that I have no idea what to learn or where to start. I'm primarily web development but in this case I don't know how much difference it will make.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-10):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Well, there are great ressources for advanced Python programming :</p>

<ul>
<li>Dive Into Python (<a href="http://diveintopython.org/" rel="nofollow">read it for free</a>)</li>
<li>Online python cookbooks (e.g. <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/langs/python/" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://the.taoofmac.com/space/Python/Grimoire" rel="nofollow">there</a>)</li>
<li>O'Reilly's Python Cookbook (see amazon)</li>
<li>A funny riddle game : <a href="http://www.pythonchallenge.com/" rel="nofollow">Python Challenge</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a list of subjects you must master if you want to write "Python" on your resume :</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow">list comprehensions</a></li>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/231767/the-python-yield-keyword-explained/231855#231855">iterators and generators</a></li>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/739654/understanding-python-decorators/1594484#1594484">decorators</a></li>
</ul>

<p>They are what make Python such a cool language (with the standard library of course, that I keep discovering everyday).</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Depending on exactly what you mean by "gotten to grips with the basics", I'd suggest reading through <a href="http://diveintopython.org/" rel="nofollow">Dive Into Python</a> and typing/executing all the chapter code, then get something like <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0596529325" rel="nofollow">Programming Collective Intelligence</a> and working through it - you'll learn python quite well, not to mention some quite excellent algorithms that'll come in handy to a web developer.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Something great to play around with, though not a project, is <a href="http://pythonchallenge.com" rel="nofollow">The Python Challenge</a>.  I've found it quite useful in improving my python skills, and it gives your brain a good workout at the same time.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I honestly loved the book <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0596009259" rel="nofollow">Programming Python.</a> It has a large assortment of small projects, most of which can be completed in an evening at a leisurely pace.  They get you acquainted with most of the standard library and will likely hold your interest.  Most importantly these small projects are actually useful in a "day to day" sense.  The book pretty much only assumes you know and understand the bare essentials of Python as a language, rather than knowledge of it's huge API library.</p>

<p>I think you'll find it'll be well worth working through.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p><em>The Python Cookbook</em> is absolutely essential if you want to master idiomatic Python. Besides, that's the book that made me fall in love with the language.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I'd suggest writing a non-trivial webapp using either Django or Pylons, something that does some number crunching.
No better way to learn a new language than commiting yourself to a problem and learning as you go!</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Write a web app, likely in <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/" rel="nofollow">Django</a> - the <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/" rel="nofollow">docs</a> will teach you a lot of good Python style.</p>

<p>Use some of the popular libraries like <a href="http://pygments.org/" rel="nofollow">Pygments</a> or the <a href="http://www.feedparser.org/" rel="nofollow">Universal Feed Parser</a>. Both of these make extremely useful functions, which are hard to get right, available in a well-documented API.</p>

<p>In general, I'd stay away from libs that aren't well documented -
you'll bang your head on the wall trying to reverse-engineer them -
and libraries that are wrappers around C libraries, if you don't have
any C experience. I worked on wxPython code when I was still learning
Python, which was my first language, and at the time it was little
more than a wrapper around wxWidgets. That code was easily the ugliest
I've ever written.</p>

<p>I didn't get that much out of Dive Into Python, except for the dynamic import chapter - that's not really well-documented elsewhere.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>People tend to say something along the lines of "The best way to learn is by doing" but I've always found that unless you're specifically learning a language to contribute to some project it's difficult to actually find little problems to tackle to keep yourself going.</p>

<p>A good solution to this is <a href="http://projecteuler.net/" rel="nofollow">Project Euler</a>, which has a list of various programming\mathematics challenges ranging from simple  to quite brain-taxing. As an example, the first challenge is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And by problem #50 it's already getting a little tougher</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Which prime, below one-million, can be written as the sum of the most consecutive primes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are 208 in total, but I think some new ones get added here and there.</p>

<p>While I already knew python fairly well before starting Project Euler, I found that I learned some cool tricks purely through using the language so much. Good luck!</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>I'll plug <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/s_lott/books/python.html" rel="nofollow">Building Skills in Python</a>.   Plus, if you want something more challenging, <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/s_lott/books/oodesign.html" rel="nofollow">Building Skills in OO Design</a> is a rather large and complex series of exercises.</p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>Search "Alex Martelli", "Alex Martelli patterns" and "Thomas Wouters" on Google video. There's plenty of interesting talks on andvanced Python, design patterns in Python, and so on.</p>
