<h3>Question (ID-183853):</h3><h2>In Python, what is the difference between '/' and '//' when used for division?</h2><p>Is there a benefit to using one over the other? They both seem to return the same results.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 6/3
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; 6//3
2
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-9):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>In Python 3.0, <code>5 / 2</code> will return <code>2.5</code> and <code>5 // 2</code> will return <code>2</code>.  The former is floating point division, and the latter is floor division, sometimes also called integer division.</p>

<p>In Python 2.2 or later in the 2.x line, there is no difference for integers unless you perform a <code>from __future__ import division</code>, which causes Python 2.x to adopt the behavior of 3.0</p>

<p>Regardless of the future import, <code>5.0 // 2</code> will return <code>2.0</code> since that's the floor division result of the operation.</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>As everyone has already answered, <code>//</code> is floor division.</p>

<p>Why this is important is that <code>//</code> is unambiguously floor division, in all Python versions from 2.2, including Python 3.x versions.</p>

<p>The behavior of <code>/</code> can change depending on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Active <code>__future__</code> import or not (module-local)</li>
<li>Python command line option, either <code>-Q old</code> or <code>-Q new</code></li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>// implements "floor division", regardless of your type. So
1.0/2.0 will give 0.5, but both 1/2, 1//2 and 1.0//2.0 will give 0</p>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>The double '//' is floor division:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 7//3
2

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Please refer <a href="http://python-history.blogspot.com/2009/03/problem-with-integer-division.html" rel="nofollow">The Problem with Integer Division</a> for the reason for introducing the // operator to do integer division.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p><code>//</code> is floor division, it will always give you the integer floor of the result.  The other is 'regular' division.</p>

<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>I think // means floor division. Could be wrong.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>// is a floor division. You are not wrong.</p>
