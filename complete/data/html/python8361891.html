<h3>Question (ID-8361891):</h3><h2>Unneeded parts when unwrapping tuple/list</h2><p>Python is all about writing beautiful code. So, I was running <code>pylint</code> to check the "beautifulness" of my code, when I bump into something:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unused variable 'myvar1'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From this part of my code:</p>

<pre><code>for myvar1, myvar2 in mylist:
    # Do stuff just using myvar2
</code></pre>

<p><code>mylist</code> is a list of tuples, so I'm unwrapping the tuples into two variables (<code>myvar1</code> and <code>myvar2</code>). I'm defining those two variables just to unwrap the second one, because I don't need the other.</p>

<p><strong>So, here's my question:</strong> Is there a way to tell the interpreter to unwrap the tuple, but not assing the first part (for example). In some other languages you can do something like:</p>

<pre><code>for _, myvar in mylist:
    # Do stuff with myvar
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>for *, myvar in mylist:
    # Do stuff with myvar
</code></pre>

<p>That means: <em>I don't care about the first part of the tuple, I just need the second one.</em></p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> I know that this could be an option for what I'm asking:</p>

<pre><code>for mytuple in mylist:
    # Do stuff with mytuple[1]
</code></pre>

<p>But that's by far less readable.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Did you try either of these?</p>

<pre><code>for _, myvar in mylist:
    #Do stuff
</code></pre>

<p>works fine in Python and is relatively idiomatic.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I suppose you could do this:</p>

<pre><code>for myvar in (t[1] for t in mylist):
    pass
</code></pre>

<p>But frankly I think you should just ignore the pylint warning in this case--it's beautiful enough and won't cause any confusion (which is why you want to beauty in the first place).</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I write <code>for _, myvar2 in mylist</code> when I want to emphasize that only <em>myvar2</em> is used.  </p>

<p>And I write <code>for myvar1, myvar2 in mylist</code> when I want to remind the reader (usually me) what the record structure is.</p>

<p>The <code>_</code> name is just a naming convention for a throw-away value.  The CPython interpreter makes the variable assignment for it just like it would with any other variable name (fortunately, *STORE_FAST* is a very cheap operation).  In contrast, the <a href="http://pypy.org/" rel="nofollow">PyPy interpreter</a> will identify the unused variable assignment as dead code, so you get the optimization for free regardless of how you write it.</p>

<p>If you're curious about how CPython interprets your code, the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/dis.html#module-dis" rel="nofollow">dis module</a> can provide useful insights:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from dis import dis
&gt;&gt;&gt; def f(lot):
        for _, var2 in lot:
            print var2


&gt;&gt;&gt; dis(f)
  2           0 SETUP_LOOP              25 (to 28)
              3 LOAD_FAST                0 (lot)
              6 GET_ITER            
        &gt;&gt;    7 FOR_ITER                17 (to 27)
             10 UNPACK_SEQUENCE          2
             13 STORE_FAST               1 (_)
             16 STORE_FAST               2 (var2)

  3          19 LOAD_FAST                2 (var2)
             22 PRINT_ITEM          
             23 PRINT_NEWLINE       
             24 JUMP_ABSOLUTE            7
        &gt;&gt;   27 POP_BLOCK           
        &gt;&gt;   28 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)
             31 RETURN_VALUE 
</code></pre>

<p>As the other posters have mentioned, the warnings from <em>pylint</em> can sometimes be inane.  If you prefer a short variable name in your code, then just ignore the pylint complaint.  As Francis Avila pointed out, pylint should't complain about <code>_</code> in this context.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>In addition to @RaymondHettinger's answer: Pylint also does not complain about unused variables if their names start with a single underscore. This means that you can use:</p>

<pre><code>for _myvar1, myvar2 in mylist:
</code></pre>

<p>getting the best of both worlds: </p>

<ul>
<li>no Pylint warning, </li>
<li>and information about the record structure</li>
</ul>

<p>This works for function / method prototypes too and avoids warnings about unused parameters, which you can often get when deriving from a base class in an OO framework. </p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I would say Python is all about writing <em>readable</em> code - any "beauty" is merely a side-effect.</p>

<p>The first item of the tuple could be eliminated like this:</p>

<pre><code>for myvar2 in zip(*mylist)[1]:
    # Do stuff with myvar2
</code></pre>

<p>But I'm not sure I'd really recommend it. Personally I would just use:</p>

<pre><code>for myvar1, myvar2 in mylist:
    # Do stuff with myvar2
</code></pre>

<p>... and ignore pylint.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><pre><code>tu = [(12,'sea'),(478,'badada'),(789,'zut')]

for x,x in tu:
    print x
</code></pre>

<p>result</p>

<pre><code>sea
badada
zut
</code></pre>
