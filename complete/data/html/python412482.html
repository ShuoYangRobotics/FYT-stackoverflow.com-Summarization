<p>edit: It'll help if you could explain why you think that resource is useful.</p>

<p>I have gone over it in a weekend or so and it was enough to learn almost all the idioms of the language and get the feeling of what is "the Python way" :-)</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Not sure if you already considered that, but <a href="http://docs.python.org/3.0/" rel="nofollow">documentation at the official site</a> is very good. In particular, <a href="http://docs.python.org/3.0/tutorial/index.html" rel="nofollow">Tutorial</a> lets you start quickly</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><a href="http://python.net/~goodger/projects/pycon/2007/idiomatic/handout.html" rel="nofollow">Code Like a Pythonista: Idiomatic Python</a></p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>My recommendation is to follow the standard tutorial (I find it very good) and, if you want to have a lot of fun while learning the language, definitely check out Python Challenge (<a href="http://www.pythonchallenge.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pythonchallenge.com/</a>).</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Search "Alex Martelli - Python For Programmers" on Google Video. Good introductory (but fast-paced) talk. Related videos are also worth watching.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>My answer is to read and immediately buy Beazly's <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0672328623" rel="nofollow">Python Essential Reference</a>.  </p>

<p>This book's introduction to the Python core language is the best I've seen, and it's written for experienced programmers looking to get up to speed on Python quickly, a.k.a. you.</p>

<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>I bookmarked this <a href="http://www.awaretek.com/tutorials.html" rel="nofollow">link</a> on my Delicous when I was starting out - it's a bunch of links to Python tutorials.<br />
 I like <a href="http://diveintopython.org/" rel="nofollow">Dive into Python</a> and the standard documentation as well. It assumes you know the basics of how to program and concentrates of showing how to use Python - it uses some nice realistic and useful code to explain. </p>
