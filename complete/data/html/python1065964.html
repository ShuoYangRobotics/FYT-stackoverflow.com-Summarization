<h3>Question (ID-1065964):</h3><h2>Recommended IDE for developing Pylons apps</h2><p>I have been reading through this wonderful website regarding the recommended Python IDEs and have narrowed it down to either</p>

<ol>
<li><p>WingIDE</p></li>
<li><p>KomodoIDE</p></li>
</ol>

<p>which you guys will recommend for the purpose of developing Pylons apps? I know that most questions have been asked pertaining to Python IDEs but how about Python web framework IDEs which is a mishmash of various templating languages and Python itself.</p>

<p>One con i have to raise about WingIDE on Windows is that it has an AWFUL interface (probably cos of the GTK+ toolkit?)</p>

<p>I have been using e-text editor all the while and increasingly been dissatisfied with it especially when its unable to do correct syntax highlighting at times. Furthermore I am hoping syntax coloration can be done for Mako templates.</p>

<p>Thank you very much all and have a great day!</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>+1 for WingIDE, It supports <a href="http://www.wingware.com/doc/howtos/paste-pylons" rel="nofollow">debugging pylons app</a>. </p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I'v been using Spyderlib for some time, its really worth trying.</p>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.netbeans.org/" rel="nofollow">Netbeans</a> has implemented <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/features/python/index.html" rel="nofollow">beta</a> support of python development. It unfortunately doesn't specifically support any templating languages that I know of, but I've been satisfied so far with its syntax highlighting and auto-complete (especially from imported modules). </p>

<p>Since everyone has a different preference for their coding environment, I suggest you just try out every IDE/editor you can get your hands on; so you can find the best mix-match of features that you're specifically looking for.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I use <a href="http://pythonide.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Stani's Python Editor</a> for most Python-esque editing tasks on Windows &amp; Linux.  I use <a href="http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm" rel="nofollow">Notepad++</a> for editing HTML, XML, CSV, and other text based "code like" files on Windows.  They are both free, and meet my needs for home based weekend projects.  </p>

<p>I have used <a href="http://www.wingware.com/wingide-101" rel="nofollow">Wing IDE 101</a>, but I never the full versions.  I did not do enough with WingIDE to develop any muscle memory, so it still feels a little artificial to me.  YMMV.  </p>

<p>To a certain degree, the IDE will influence how you think about the process of creating and debugging code.  So you should take some time to try a few different options and see which makes the most sense to you.  </p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>+1 for Spyder. Never heard of it before reading this page. Working great so far.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>after very very careful comparison, KomodoIDE 5.1 is most suitable for my purposes.</p>

<p>Reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Extensibility</p></li>
<li><p>Support for Mako and YUI (required by me)</p></li>
<li><p>Native interface support (no GTK unfamiliarity)</p></li>
<li><p>Support for Mercurial SCM (required by me)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>thats all I guess. I am extremely satisfied with KomodoIDE and have just shelled out some money to buy it.</p>

<p>I figured when making a choice of tools, spend a day or two (yes, it takes time) trying them out and choosing what best suits your day-to-day purposes. If its just your first time coding, using a standard free tool or open source tool is far more useful than expending the time to find out the best tool.</p>

<p>Only after some degree of expertise is acquired, you have a very narrow spectrum of requirements/preferences which will make choosing a tool far easier.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>Wow, I've also been looking for a good Pylons web app IDE.  Seems like KomodoIDE 5.1 kicks some serious ass.  I love the support for Mako and that it supports pretty much all of the SCMs.  </p>

<p>I've been using Textmate, but KomodoIDE will take over from now onwards</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>Try Aptana Studio... It's eclipse+pydev+web stuff, it doesnt have any specific pylons stuff or mako support. But eclipse+pydev alone is great + all the nice jscript+html+css stuff aptana adds.</p>
