<h3>Question (ID-2956353):</h3><h2>finding and returning a string with a specified prefix</h2><p>I am close but I am not sure what to do with the restuling match object. If I do </p>

<pre><code>p = re.search('[/@.* /]', str)
</code></pre>

<p>I'll get any words that start with @ and end up with a space. This is what I want. However this returns a Match object that I dont' know what to do with. What's the most computationally efficient way of finding and returning a string which is prefixed with a @?</p>

<p>For example, </p>

<pre><code>"Hi there @guy"
</code></pre>

<p>After doing the proper calculations, I would be returned </p>

<pre><code>guy
</code></pre>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The following regular expression do what you need:</p>

<pre><code>import re
s = "Hi there @guy"
p = re.search(r'@(\w+)', s)
print p.group(1)
</code></pre>

<p>It will also work for the following string formats:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>s = "Hi there @guy "</code> # notice the trailing space</li>
<li><code>s = "Hi there @guy,"</code> # notice the trailing comma</li>
<li><code>s = "Hi there @guy and"</code> # notice the next word</li>
<li><code>s = "Hi there @guy22"</code> # notice the trailing numbers</li>
<li><code>s = "Hi there @22guy"</code> # notice the leading numbers</li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>That regex does not do what you think it does.</p>

<pre><code>s = "Hi there @guy"
p = re.search(r'@([^ ]+)', s) # this is the regex you described
print p.group(1) # first thing matched inside of ( .. )
</code></pre>

<p>But as usually with regex, there are tons of examples that break this, for example if the text is <code>s = "Hi there @guy, what's with the comma?"</code> the result would be <code>guy,</code>. </p>

<p>So you really need to think about every possible thing you want and don't want to match. <code>r'@([a-zA-Z]+)'</code> might be a good starting point, it literally only matches letters (a .. z, no unicode etc).</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><code>p.group(0)</code> should return <code>guy</code>. If you want to find out what function an object has, you can use the <code>dir(p)</code> method to find out. This will return a list of attributes and methods that are available for that object instance.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><pre><code>(?&lt;=@)\w+
</code></pre>

<p>will match a word if it's preceded by a <code>@</code> (without adding it to the match, a so-called positive lookbehind). This will match "words" that are composed of letters, numbers, and/or underscore; if you don't want those, use <code>(?&lt;=@)[^\W\d_]+</code></p>

<p>In Python:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; strg = "Hi there @guy!"
&gt;&gt;&gt; p = re.search(r'(?&lt;=@)\w+', strg)
&gt;&gt;&gt; p.group()
'guy'
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>As it's evident from the answers so far regex is the most efficient solution for your problem. Answers differ slightly regarding what you allow to be followed by the <code>@</code>:</p>

<pre><code>[^ ] anything but space
\w   in python-2.x is equivalent to [A-Za-z0-9_], in py3k is locale dependent
</code></pre>

<p>If you have better idea what characters might be included in the user name you might adjust your regex to reflect that, e.g., only lower case ascii letters, would be:</p>

<pre><code>[a-z]
</code></pre>

<p>NB: I skipped quantifiers for simplicity.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>You say: """If I do <code>p = re.search('[/@.* /]', str)</code> I'll get any words that start with @ and end up with a space."" But this is incorrect -- that pattern is a character class which will match ONE character in the set <code>@/.*</code> and space. Note: there's a redundant second <code>/</code> in the pattern.
For example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; re.findall('[/@.* /]', 'xxx@foo x/x.x*x xxxx')
['@', ' ', '/', '.', '*', ' ']
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You say that you want <code>"guy"</code> returned from <code>"Hi there @guy"</code> but that conflicts with "and end up with a space".</p>

<p>Please edit your question to include what you really want/need to match.</p>
