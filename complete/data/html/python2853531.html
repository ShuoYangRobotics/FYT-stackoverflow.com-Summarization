<h3>Question (ID-2853531):</h3><h2>How do you PEP 8-name a class whose name is an acronym?</h2><p>I try to adhere to the style guide for Python code (also known as <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow">PEP 8</a>). Accordingly, the preferred way to name a class is using CamelCase:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Almost without exception, class names
  use the CapWords convention. Classes for internal use have a leading underscore in addition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How can I be consistent with PEP 8 if my class name is formed by two acronyms (which in proper English should be capitalized). For instance, if my class name was 'NASA JPL', what would you name it?:</p>

<pre><code>class NASAJPL():  # 1
class NASA_JPL(): # 2
class NasaJpl():  # 3
</code></pre>

<p>I am using #1, but it looks weird; #3 looks weird too, and #2 seems to violate PEP 8. </p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Many thanks for your answers. While the question really does not have a 'correct' answer, I benefited a lot from your insights. </p>

<p>I will be resorting to a #3: better to be consistently wrong (in the sense of having an acronym/abbreviation as a <code>Title</code>) than inconsistently right.</p>

<p>Thanks again.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow">PEP-8</a> does cover this (at least partially):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: When using abbreviations in CapWords, capitalize all the letters of the abbreviation.  Thus <code>HTTPServerError</code> is better than <code>HttpServerError</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which I would read to mean that <code>NASAJPL()</code> is the recommended name according to PEP-8.  </p>

<p>Personally I'd find <code>NasaJpl()</code> the <a href="http://www.garrettreil.ie/design-research-blog_files/Use-of-English-in-Irish-sign-design.php" rel="nofollow">easiest to scan</a> since the upper case letters easily mark word boundaries and give the name a distinctive shape.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>I also work in an acronym-heavy environment. I tend to prefer form #3 because even though it lower-cases parts of an acronym, it clearly delineates parts of the name. It also avoids confusion when part of the name is an acronym and part is a word. </p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><code>#1</code> in this particular case looks fine to me (if it's <em>really</em> an acronym). Out of curiosity, what does it stand for (and what exactly is the class instance, maybe a <code>module</code> would be the more appropriate divisor)?</p>

<pre><code>class NASAJPL:
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: when you're combining two acronyms chances are you want to divide functionality over modules (you never know when you're adding that next feature to your program):</p>

<pre><code>from NASA import JPL
from NASA import ARC
</code></pre>

<p>If <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/81179/christophed">ChristophD</a>'s <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2853531/how-do-you-pep-8-name-a-class-whose-name-is-an-acronym/2853562#2853562">split it into a module hierarchy</a> suggestion isn't a viable option, then I'd suggest your #2 form (<code>class NASA_JPL ():</code>) is the most legible, PEP-8 be damned.</p>

<h2>No, really...</h2>

<p>That said... I don't think PEP-8 need be damned in order for you to use that option <em>and</em> still adhere to its core principles. As you point out in your original question, itself, the first sentence of the "CamelCase class names" guideline begins:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Almost without exception, [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>PEP-8's "fundamental principles" statement, as <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/55155/dan">Dan</a> alludes to with the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2853531/how-do-you-pep-8-name-a-class-whose-name-is-an-acronym/2853590#2853590">"A Foolish Consistency [...]"</a> line, declares legibility and comprehensibility the primary goals of PEP-8's recommendations. PEP-8 is a collection of established, successful patterns in service to those goals.</p>

<h2><em><a href="http://www.bartleby.com/100/420.47.html" rel="nofollow">Emerson</a></em> on the application of PEP-8 to reality...</h2>

<p>Fundamentally, any system has aspects which are necessarily inconsistent with the character of the whole. When a system makes good and consistent use of a style guide's recommendations, any inconsistencies will be <em>conscious</em> responses to <em>necessity</em>. (I regard maintaining the legibility of corner cases as a necessity.)</p>

<p>When handled this way, those inconsistencies, counter-intuitively, reinforce the cohesion of the whole, rather than disrupting it.</p>

<p>PEP-8 states this more succinctly (and, thus, more usefully :) ):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But most importantly: know when to be inconsistent -- sometimes the style
  guide just doesn't apply.  When in doubt, use your best judgment.  Look
  at other examples and decide what looks best.  And don't hesitate to ask!</p>
  
  <p>Two good reasons to break a particular rule:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><p>When applying the rule would make the code less readable, even for someone who is used to reading code that follows the rules.</p></li>
  <li><p>To be consistent with surrounding code that also breaks it (maybe for historic reasons)â€”although this is also an opportunity to clean up someone else's mess (in true XP style).</p></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>It depends on the acronym. Another option would be <code>class NASAJpl():</code>, which makes it seem that "NASA" is the primary part, and "JPL" is the subordinate part.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I tend to use #3.  It looks weird at first but you (sort of) get used to it.  I went this way after suffering for too long under strings of acronyms jammed together, e.g. NPCAIXMLParser was one.  I decided that NpcAiXmlParser was much easier to read and have been doing that ever since, even though seeing these things lowercased still looks weird sometimes.</p>

<p>In terms of "the standards," I tend to think of these entities as "words" and as such capitalize them as I would capitalize any other word.  E.g. if I had a local variable representing some NPC (non-player character), I would name it 'npc' and not 'nPC'.</p>

<p>In regards to PEP-8, I disagree with this statement; I find the last spelling of the word to be preferable.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: When using abbreviations in
  CapWords, capitalize all the letters
  of the abbreviation.  Thus
  HTTPServerError is better than
  HttpServerError.</p>
</blockquote>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Number 1 is too hard to read for me - there's no way to tell that's it's two acronyms.</p>

<p>Number 2 violates PEP8, but looks fine. Remember "A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds" :)</p>

<p>I like number 3 the best, but I do a lot of C# programming - that's how you'd be supposed to do it in C#.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>As others have noted, NASAJPL is probably the PEP-8 approved form.</p>

<p>Just to be contrary, however, I would probably use NasaJPL.  Because if you are reading it, you pronounce "NASA" as a single word, whereas "JPL" you spell out.</p>

<p>You can make an argument that this is consistent with PEP-8, since "NASA" is an acronym, but "JPL" is an abbreviation (or initialism, if you want to get <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym_and_initialism" rel="nofollow">pedantic</a>).</p>
