<h3>Question (ID-2940858):</h3><h2>Kill process by name in python</h2><p>I'm trying to kill a process (specifically iChat) using python. I know how to use the command:</p>

<pre><code>ps -A | grep iChat 
</code></pre>

<p>Then:</p>

<pre><code>kill -9 PID
</code></pre>

<p>However, I'm not exactly sure how to translate these commands over to python. My guess is that it's not very difficult but I just don't know. Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>If you have killall:</p>

<pre><code>os.system("killall -9 iChat");
</code></pre>

<p>Or:</p>

<pre><code>os.system("ps -C iChat -o pid=|xargs kill -9")
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Assuming you're on a Unix-like platform (so that <code>ps -A</code> exists),</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import subprocess, signal
&gt;&gt;&gt; p = subprocess.Popen(['ps', '-A'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
&gt;&gt;&gt; out, err = p.communicate()
</code></pre>

<p>gives you <code>ps -A</code>'s output in the <code>out</code> variable (a string).  You can break it down into lines and loop on them...:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; for line in out.splitlines():
...   if 'iChat' in line:
...     pid = int(line.split(None, 1)[0])
...     os.kill(pid, signal.SIGKILL)
... 
</code></pre>

<p>(you could avoid importing <code>signal</code>, and use <code>9</code> instead of <code>signal.SIGKILL</code>, but I just don't particularly like that style, so I'd rather used the named constant this way).</p>

<p>Of course you could do much more sophisticated processing on these lines, but this mimics what you're doing in shell.</p>

<p>If what you're after is avoiding <code>ps</code>, that's hard to do across different Unix-like systems (<code>ps</code> is their common API to get a process list, in a sense).  But if you have a specific Unix-like system in mind, only (not requiring any cross-platform portability), it may be possible; in particular, on Linux, the <code>/proc</code> pseudo-filesystem is very helpful.  But you'll need to clarify your exact requirements before we can help on this latter part.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>By using psutil ( <a href="http://code.google.com/p/psutil/" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/psutil/</a> ):</p>

<pre><code>import psutil

PROCNAME = "python.exe"

for proc in psutil.process_iter():
    if proc.name == PROCNAME:
        proc.kill()
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>you can those exact commands from python like this</p>

<pre><code>import os 
print os.system('kill -9 ' + pid)
</code></pre>

<p>But your command on getting the pid needs a bit of work though (can't just assume just because it has iChat that it really is iChat) you should use killall instead as suggested by Matthew Flaschen</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You can use <code>pkill &lt;process_name&gt;</code> in a unix system to kill process by name.</p>

<p>Then the python code will be:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import os
&gt;&gt;&gt; process_name=iChat
&gt;&gt;&gt; os.system('pkill '+process_name)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>you can use WMI module to do this on windows, though it's a lot clunkier than you unix folks are used to; <code>import WMI</code> takes a long time and there's intermediate pain to get at the process.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>The below code will kill all iChat oriented programs:</p>

<pre><code>p = subprocess.Popen(['pgrep', '-l' , 'iChat'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
out, err = p.communicate()

for line in out.splitlines():        
    line = bytes.decode(line)
    pid = int(line.split(None, 1)[0])
    os.kill(pid, signal.SIGKILL)
</code></pre>
