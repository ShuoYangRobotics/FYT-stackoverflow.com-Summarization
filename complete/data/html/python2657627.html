<h3>Question (ID-2657627):</h3><h2>Why does python use 'magic methods'?</h2><p>I've been playing around with Python recently, and one thing I'm finding a bit odd is the extensive use of 'magic methods', e.g. to make its length available an object implements a method <code>def __len__(self)</code> and then it is called when you write <code>len(obj)</code>.</p>

<p>I was just wondering why objects don't simply define a <code>len(self)</code> method and have it called directly as a member of the object, e.g. <code>obj.len()</code>? I'm sure there must be good reasons for Python doing it the way it does, but as a newbie I haven't worked out what they are yet.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>AFAIK, <code>len</code> is special in this respect and has historical roots.</p>

<p>Here's a quote <a href="http://docs.python.org/faq/design.html" rel="nofollow">from the FAQ</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Why does Python use methods for some
  functionality (e.g. list.index()) but
  functions for other (e.g. len(list))?</strong></p>
  
  <p>The major reason is history. Functions
  were used for those operations that
  were generic for a group of types and
  which were intended to work even for
  objects that didn’t have methods at
  all (e.g. tuples). It is also
  convenient to have a function that can
  readily be applied to an amorphous
  collection of objects when you use the
  functional features of Python (map(),
  apply() et al).</p>
  
  <p>In fact, implementing len(), max(),
  min() as a built-in function is
  actually less code than implementing
  them as methods for each type. One can
  quibble about individual cases but
  it’s a part of Python, and it’s too
  late to make such fundamental changes
  now. The functions have to remain to
  avoid massive code breakage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The other "magical methods" (actually called <em>special method</em> in the Python folklore) make lots of sense, and similar functionality exists in other languages. They're mostly used for code that gets called implicitly when special syntax is used.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>overloaded operators (exist in C++ and others)</li>
<li>constructor/destructor</li>
<li>hooks for accessing attributes</li>
<li>tools for metaprogramming</li>
</ul>

<p>and so on...</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>From the Zen of Python:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.<br />
     There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is one of the reasons - with custom methods, developers would be free to choose a different method name, like <code>getLength()</code>, <code>length()</code>, <code>getlength()</code> or whatsoever. Python enforces strict naming so that the common function <code>len()</code> can be used.</p>

<p>All operations that are common for many types of objects are put into magic methods, like <code>__nonzero__</code>, <code>__len__</code> or <code>__repr__</code>. They are mostly optional, though.</p>

<p>Operator overloading is also done with magic methods (e.g. <code>__le__</code>), so it makes sense to use them for other common operations, too.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Some of these functions do more than a single method would be able to implement (without abstract methods on a superclass).  For instance <code>bool()</code> acts kind of like this:</p>

<pre><code>def bool(obj):
    if hasattr(obj, '__bool__'):
        return bool(obj.__nonzero__())
    elif hasattr(obj, '__len__'):
        if obj.__len__():
            return True
        else:
            return False
    return True
</code></pre>

<p>You can also be 100% sure that <code>bool()</code> will always return True or False; if you relied on a method you couldn't be entirely sure what you'd get back.</p>

<p>Some other functions that have relatively complicated implementations (more complicated than the underlying magic methods are likely to be) are <code>iter()</code> and <code>cmp()</code>, and all the attribute methods (<code>getattr</code>, <code>setattr</code> and <code>delattr</code>).  Things like <code>int</code> also access magic methods when doing coercion (you can implement <code>__int__</code>), but do double duty as types.  <code>len(obj)</code> is actually the one case where I don't believe it's ever different from <code>obj.__len__()</code>.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>They are not really "magic names". It's just the interface an object has to implement to provide a given service. In this sense, they are not more magic than any predefined interface definition you have to reimplement.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>There is not a lot to add to the above two posts, but all the "magic" functions are not really magic at all. They are part of the __ builtins__ module which is implicitly/automatically imported when the interpreter starts. IE:</p>

<pre><code>from __builtins__ import *
</code></pre>

<p>happens every time before your program starts.</p>

<p>I always thought it would be more correct if python only did this for the interactive shell, and required scripts to import the various parts from builtins they needed. Also probably different __ main__ handling would be nice in shells vs interactive. Anyways, check out all the functions, and see what it is like without them:</p>

<pre><code>dir (__builtins__)
...
del __builtins__
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>While the reason is mostly historic, there are some peculiarities in Python's <code>len</code> that make the use of a function instead of a method appropriate. </p>

<p>Some operations in Python are implemented as methods, for example <code>list.index</code> and <code>dict.append</code>, while others are implemented as callables and magic methods, for example <code>str</code> and <code>iter</code> and <code>reversed</code>. The two groups differ enough so the different approach is justified:</p>

<ol>
<li>They are common.</li>
<li><code>str</code>, <code>int</code> and friends are types. It makes more sense to call the constructor.</li>
<li>The implementation differs from the function call. For example, <code>iter</code> might call <code>__getitem__</code> if <code>__iter__</code> isn't available, and supports additional arguments that don't fit in a method call. For the same reason <code>it.next()</code> has been changed to <code>next(it)</code> in recent versions of Python - it makes more sense.</li>
<li>Some of these are close relatives of operators. There's syntax for calling <code>__iter__</code> and <code>__next__</code> - it's called the <code>for</code> loop. For consistency, a function is better. And it makes it better for certain optimisations.</li>
<li>Some of the functions are simply way too similar to the rest in some way - <code>repr</code> acts like <code>str</code> does. Having <code>str(x)</code> versus <code>x.repr()</code> would be confusing.</li>
<li>Some of them rarely use the actual implementation method, for example <code>isinstance</code>.</li>
<li>Some of them are actual operators, <code>getattr(x, 'a')</code> is another way of doing <code>x.a</code> and <code>getattr</code> shares many of the aforementioned qualities.</li>
</ol>

<p>I personally call the first group method-like and the second group operator-like. It's not a very good distinction, but I hope it helps somehow.</p>

<p>Having said this, <code>len</code> doesn't exactly fit in the second group. It's more close to the operations in the first one, with the only difference that it's way more common than almost any of them. But the only thing that it does is calling <code>__len__</code>, and it's very close to <code>L.index</code>. However, there are some differences. For example, <code>__len__</code> might be called for the implementation of other features, such as <code>bool</code>, if the method was called <code>len</code> you might break <code>bool(x)</code> with custom <code>len</code> method that does completely different thing.</p>

<p>In short, you have a set of very common features that classes might implement that might be accessed through an operator, through a special function (that usually does more than the implementation, as an operator would), during object construction, and all of them share some common traits. All the rest is a method. And <code>len</code> is somewhat of an exception to that rule.</p>
