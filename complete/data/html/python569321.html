<h3>Question (ID-569321):</h3><h2>Simple, Cross Platform MIDI Library for Python</h2><p>I want to do build a small app that creates MIDI sounds. I've never dealt with sound in programming so I'd like to start with something that's basic and has good documentation. I want to stick with Python since I'm the most comfortable with it and don't want to overwhelm myself, initially.</p>

<p>My time is split about 50/50 between Windows and Ubuntu so something that "just works" on both platforms would be really helpful.</p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>The MIDIUtil Library (hosted <a href="http://code.google.com/p/midiutil/" rel="nofollow">here</a> at Google Code) does what you want: write MIDI Files from a pure Python library. Once nice thing about it (and full disclosure: I'm the author) is that you don't have to keep track of lower-level MID events such as note-on and note-off: it handles them for you.</p>

<p>As an example to write a note, you would do something like:</p>

<pre><code>MyMIDI = MIDIFile(1)
track = 0
channel = 0
pitch = 60
time = 0
duration = 1
volume = 100
MyMIDI.addNote(track,channel,pitch,time,duration,volume)
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><a href="http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~harrison/code.html" rel="nofollow">pyPortMidi</a> is a Python wrapper of PortMidi, which is described as a "a cross-platform C library for realtime MIDI control". I haven't used it myself, but it looks very promising. Explicit mention of being able to send MIDI data in realtime.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Midi support (in and out) has been added to pyGame 1.9, though it's mainly in the development stage and isn't very well documented yet, but it works.</p>

<p>Midi support is also being developed in the pyGame successor, pgreloaded (or pygame2).</p>

<p>Also note that even though pyGame has 'game' in the title, its uses stretch far beyond just game design.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I was looking for a pure-Python library to generate a MIDI file, <a href="http://www.mxm.dk/products/public/pythonmidi" rel="nofollow">mxm's Python MIDI library</a> is exactly that.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://snippets.dzone.com/posts/show/572" rel="nofollow">this dzone snippet</a>, there is a single-file version of the above library, <a href="http://larndham.net/service/pys60/smidi.py" rel="nofollow">smidi.py</a> (<a href="http://gist.github.com/202595" rel="nofollow">gist'd here</a> for posterity)</p>

<p>Usage is quite simple:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import smidi
&gt;&gt;&gt; m = smidi.MidiOutFile('out.mid')
&gt;&gt;&gt; m.header()
&gt;&gt;&gt; m.start_of_track()
&gt;&gt;&gt; m.update_time(0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; m.note_on(note=0x40)  # single note
&gt;&gt;&gt; m.update_time(192)
&gt;&gt;&gt; m.note_off(note=0x40) # stop it after 192
&gt;&gt;&gt; m.update_time(0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; m.end_of_track()
&gt;&gt;&gt; m.eof()
</code></pre>

<p>Presumably works on Windows (as the original example uses <code>C:\out.mid</code> as the output filename), and I've tested it on OS X</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>If you only need to generate Midi or process midi files, try <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mingus/" rel="nofollow">mingus</a>,
It's a great package and it also allows much higher abstractions such as chords, chord progressions, scales and so on.</p>
