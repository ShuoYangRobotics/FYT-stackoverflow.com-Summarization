<h3>Question (ID-1432480):</h3><h2>Any way to clear python shell?</h2><p>I know there's a similar topic about python console, but I do not know if they are the same. I tried system("clear") and it didn't work here.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<br /><h3>Answers (Total-11):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p><code>os.system('clear')</code> works on linux. If you are running windows try <code>os.system('CLS')</code> instead.</p>

<p>You need to import os first like this: </p>

<pre><code>import os
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The "cls" and "clear" are commands which will clear a terminal (ie a DOS prompt, or terminal window).  From your screenshot, you are using the shell within IDLE, which won't be affected by such things.  Unfortunately, I don't think there is a way to clear the screen in IDLE.  The best you could do is to scroll the screen down lots of lines, eg:</p>

<pre><code>print "\n" * 100
</code></pre>

<p>Though you could put this in a function:</p>

<pre><code>def cls(): print "\n" * 100
</code></pre>

<p>And then call it when needed as <code>cls()</code></p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>The way to execute commands in Python 2.4+ is to use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/subprocess.html" rel="nofollow">subprocess</a> module. You can use it in the same way that you use <code>os.system</code>.</p>

<pre><code>import subprocess
subprocess.call("clear") # linux/mac
subprocess.call("cls", shell=True) # windows
</code></pre>

<p>If you're executing this in the python console, you'll need to do something to hide the return value (for either <code>os.system</code> or <code>subprocess.call</code>), like assigning it to a variable:</p>

<pre><code>cls = subprocess.call("cls", shell=True)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>There does not appear to be a way to clear the IDLE 'shell' buffer.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Your screenshot shows you're using IDLE. <code>cls</code>/<code>clear</code> won't work for you.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>File -> New Window</p>

<p><strong>In the new window**</strong></p>

<p>Run -> Python Shell</p>

<p>The problem with this method is that it will clear all the things you defined, such as variables.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you should just use command prompt. </p>

<p>open up command prompt</p>

<p>type "cd c:\python27"</p>

<p>type "python example.py" , you have to edit this using IDLE when it's not in interactive mode. If you're in python shell, file -> new window.</p>

<p>Note that the example.py needs to be in the same directory as C:\python27, or whatever directory you have python installed.</p>

<p>Then from here, you just press the UP arrow key on your keyboard. You just edit example.py, use CTRL + S, then go back to command prompt, press the UP arrow key, hit enter.</p>

<p>If the command prompt gets too crowded, just type "clr"</p>

<p>The "clr" command only works with command prompt, it will not work with IDLE.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Try this: <code>os.system("cls")</code></p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>As mark.ribau said, it seems that there is no way to clear the Text widget in idle. One should edit the <code>EditorWindow.py</code> module and add a method and a menu item in the EditorWindow class that does something like:</p>

<pre><code>self.text.tag_remove("sel", "1.0", "end")
self.text.delete("1.0", "end")
</code></pre>

<p>and perhaps some more tag management of which I'm unaware of.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>If you want to clear the shell buffer go to shell > restart shell in IDLE. Your question is a little vague. Do you want to clear the shell buffer or are you trying to call the OS command?</p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>An extension for clearing the shell can be found in <a href="http://bugs.python.org/issue6143" rel="nofollow">Issue6143</a> as a "feature request". This extension is included with <a href="http://idlex.sourceforge.net" rel="nofollow">IdleX</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#10</b><br /><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import os

&gt;&gt;&gt;def cls():
...    os.system("clear")
...
&gt;&gt;&gt;cls
</code></pre>

<p>That does is perfectly.  No '0' printed either.</p>
