<h3>Question (ID-3294889):</h3><h2>Iterating over Dictionaries...For Loops in Python</h2><p>Am a bit puzzled by the following code:</p>

<pre><code>d = {'x': 1, 'y': 2, 'z': 3} 
for key in d:
    print key, 'corresponds to', d[key]
</code></pre>

<p>What i don't understand is the 'key' portion. How does python recognize that it only need to read the key from the dictionary? Is key a special word in python? Or is key simply a variable? Further clarification would be much appreciated.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>key is just a variable name.  </p>

<p><code>for key in d:</code> will simply loop over the keys in the dictionary, rather than the keys and values.  To loop over both key and value you can use <code>for key, value in d.iteritems():</code></p>

<p>Test for yourself, change the word <code>key</code> to <code>poop</code></p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>When you iterate through dictionaries using the <code>for .. in ..</code>-syntax, it always iterates over the keys (the values are accessible using <code>dictionary[key]</code>).</p>

<p>To iterate over key-value pairs, use <code>for k,v in s.iteritems()</code>. </p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>This is a very common looping idiom. <code>in</code> is an operator. For when to use <code>for key in dict</code> and when it must be <code>for key in dict.keys()</code> see <a href="http://python.net/~goodger/projects/pycon/2007/idiomatic/handout.html#use-in-where-possible-1" rel="nofollow">David Goodger's Idiomatic Python article</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>It's not that key is a special word, but that dictionaries implement the iterator protocol.  You could do this in your class, e.g. see this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19151/build-a-basic-python-iterator/24377#24377">question</a> for how to build class iterators.  In the case of dictionaries, it's implemented at the C level.  The details are available in <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0234/" rel="nofollow">PEP 234</a>.  In particular, the section titled "Dictionary Iterators":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dictionaries implement a tp_iter slot that returns an efficient
        iterator that iterates over the keys of the dictionary.  [...] This 
        means that we can write</p>

<pre><code>      for k in dict: ...

  which is equivalent to, but much faster than

      for k in dict.keys(): ...

  as long as the restriction on modifications to the dictionary
  (either by the loop or by another thread) are not violated.

- Add methods to dictionaries that return different kinds of
  iterators explicitly:

      for key in dict.iterkeys(): ...

      for value in dict.itervalues(): ...

      for key, value in dict.iteritems(): ...

  This means that "for x in dict" is shorthand for "for x in
  dict.iterkeys()".
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>key is simple a variable.</p>

<p>You can do this:</p>

<pre><code>d = {'x': 1, 'y': 2, 'z': 3} 
for poop in d:
    print poop, 'corresponds to', d[poop]
</code></pre>

<p>... or better,</p>

<pre><code>d = {'x': 1, 'y': 2, 'z': 3} 
for the_key, the_value in d.iteritems():
    print the_key, 'corresponds to', the_value
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>as others have pointed out, iterating over a <code>dict</code> iterates through it's keys in no particular order.</p>

<p>As you can see here</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; d = {'x': 1, 'y': 2, 'z': 3} 
&gt;&gt;&gt; list(d)
['y', 'x', 'z']
&gt;&gt;&gt; d.keys()
['y', 'x', 'z']
</code></pre>

<p>For your example it is a better idea to use <code>dict.items()</code></p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; d.items()
[('y', 2), ('x', 1), ('z', 3)]
</code></pre>

<p>This gives you a list of tuples. When you loop over them like this, each tuple is unpacked into <code>k</code> and <code>v</code> automatically</p>

<pre><code>for k,v in d.items():
    print k, 'corresponds to', v
</code></pre>

<p>Using <code>k</code> and <code>v</code> as variable names when looping over a <code>dict</code> is quite common if the body of the loop is only a few lines. For more complicated loops it may be a  good idea to use more descriptive names</p>

<pre><code>for letter, number in d.items():
    print letter, 'corresponds to', number
</code></pre>

<p>It's a good idea going forward to get into the habit of using format strings</p>

<pre><code>for letter, number in d.items():
    print '{0} corresponds to {1}'.format(letter, number)
</code></pre>
