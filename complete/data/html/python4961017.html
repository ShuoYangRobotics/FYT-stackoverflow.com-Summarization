<h3>Question (ID-4961017):</h3><h2>Clojure style function "threading" in Python</h2><p>Clojure has a "->" macro which inserts each expression recursively as the first argument of the next expression.</p>

<p>This means that I could write:</p>

<pre><code>(-&gt; arg f1 f2 f3)
</code></pre>

<p>and it behaves like (shell piping):</p>

<pre><code>f3(f2(f1(arg)))
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to do this in Python; however, searching seems to be a nightmare!  I couldn't search for "->", and neither could I search for Python function <em>threading</em>!</p>

<p>Is there a way to overload, say, the | operator so that I could write this in Python?</p>

<pre><code>arg | f1 | f2 | f3
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks!</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>You can easily implement something like this yourself.</p>

<pre><code>def compose(current_value, *args):
    for func in args:
        current_value = func(current_value)
    return current_value

def double(n):
    return 2*n

print compose(5, double, double) # prints 20
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Or possibly use the reduce function in the following way:</p>

<pre><code>reduce(lambda x,f : f(x), [f1,f2,f3], arg)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Building on Howard's solution:</p>

<pre><code>def T(*args):
  return reduce(lambda l, r: r(l), args)

def dbl(n):
    return 2*n

T(5,dbl,dbl)
#=&gt; 20

T(5,dbl,dbl,lambda x: 3*x)
#=&gt; 60
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>While I sympathize with the desire to create cool new language constructs (Ã  la Lisp macros), it is not really the Python philosophy to do this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import this
[...]
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
</code></pre>

<p>But as the respondents have said, you can do your function chaining in a variety of ways.  Here is one that's perhaps more explicitly Lisp-like, if that suits your fancy:</p>

<pre><code>a = lambda x: x*2
b = lambda x: x+1

def chain(first, *args):
    if len(args) == 0:
        return first
    else:
        return first(chain(*args))

print chain(b, a, 1)

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>No, there is not (at least sanely). Nor would you want to. Why not just write <code>f3(f2(f1(arg)))</code>? Or better yet, model your problem in a way that doesn't require recursion.</p>

<p>You might be able to overload <code>|</code> by wrapping expressions in a class and defining <code>__or__</code> in that class, but please, for the love of Guido, don't do that.</p>

<p>You could also do what <code>btilly</code> wrote, but I wouldn't recommend that either. Work within what the language provides you.</p>

A module that provide a syntax like :</p>

<pre><code>  fib() | take_while(lambda x: x &lt; 1000000)
        | where(lambda x: x % 2)
        | select(lambda x: x * x)
        | sum()
</code></pre>
