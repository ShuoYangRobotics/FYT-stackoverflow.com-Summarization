<h3>Question (ID-597224):</h3><h2>looking for a working linux command line tool to download from rapidshare</h2><p>I'm wondering if anyone knows about a working command line tool for linux to download using premium account on rapidshare. I've seen a <a href="http://juanjoalvarez.net/rapidsucker" rel="nofollow">python solution</a>, which does not work for me -- returns urllib2 error message</p>

<pre><code>urlopen error unknown url type: https
</code></pre>

<p>and my knowledge of python is not yet deep enough to figure out why: might be a recent RS change or something is wrong with my settings.</p>

<p>Any other tools around someone may be using and could share a link?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p><a href="http://curl.haxx.se/" rel="nofollow"><code>curl</code></a> is a remarkably powerful command-line tool for squeezing things out of web servers.  I can't say about RapidShare in particular, but if you see what the manual download is doing, you can get curl to post the same forms, for example.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/" rel="nofollow"><code>wget</code></a> works well. You have to point it to a file containing the cookie corresponding to your Rapidshare account (e.g. the <code>cookies.txt</code> in Firefox's profile directory). </p>

<pre><code>wget --load-cookies /path/to/cookies.txt http://...
</code></pre>

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I like <a href="http://code.google.com/p/plowshare/" rel="nofollow">Plowshare</a>.<br/>
It let's you (depending on file hosting)</p>

<ul>
<li>download</li>
<li>upload</li>
<li>list</li>
<li>delete</li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>To get urllib2 to open https URLs you need Python with SSL support. How to get it depends on your distribution.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Nice commandline tool for RapidShare and many other services (MegaUploads, HotFiles etc). It allows simultanous transfer from different services:</p>

<p><a href="http://svn.pld-linux.org/cgi-bin/viewsvn/toys/rsget.pl/" rel="nofollow">http://svn.pld-linux.org/cgi-bin/viewsvn/toys/rsget.pl/</a></p>

<p>Just create file with list of URLs (# for comment), and start rsget.pl list-of-urls
It monitors file with url list, so you can add/remove links without restarting script (i.e. breaking current transfer).</p>
