<h3>Question (ID-1374457):</h3><h2>Find out how many times a regex matches in a string in Python</h2><p>Is there a way that I can find out how many matches of a regex are in a string in Python? For example, if I have the string <code>"It actually happened when it acted out of turn."</code></p>

<p>I want to know how many times <code>"t a"</code> appears in the string. In that string, <code>"t a"</code> appears twice. I want my function to tell me it appeared twice. Is this possible?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I know this is a question about regex. I just thought I'd mention the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#str.count" rel="nofollow">count</a> method for future reference if someone wants a non-regex solution.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s = "It actually happened when it acted out of turn."
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.count('t a')
2
</code></pre>

<p>Which return the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The existing solutions based on <code>findall</code> are fine for non-overlapping matches (and no doubt optimal except maybe for HUGE number of matches), although alternatives such as <code>sum(1 for m in re.finditer(thepattern, thestring))</code> (to avoid ever materializing the list when all you care about is the count) are also quite possible. Somewhat idiosyncratic would be using <code>subn</code> and ignoring the resulting string...:</p>

<pre><code>def countnonoverlappingrematches(pattern, thestring):
  return re.subn(pattern, '', thestring)[1]
</code></pre>

<p>the only real advantage of this latter idea would come if you only cared to count (say) up to 100 matches; then, <code>re.subn(pattern, '', thestring, 100)[1]</code> might be practical (returning 100 whether there are 100 matches, or 1000, or even larger numbers).</p>

<p>Counting <strong>overlapping</strong> matches requires you to write more code, because the built-in functions in question are all focused on NON-overlapping matches. There's also a problem of definition, e.g, with pattern being <code>'a+'</code> and thestring being <code>'aa'</code>, would you consider this to be just one match, or three (the first <code>a</code>, the second one, both of them), or...?</p>

<p>Assuming for example that you want possibly-overlapping matches <em>starting at distinct spots in the string</em> (which then would give TWO matches for the example in the previous paragraph):</p>

<pre><code>def countoverlappingdistinct(pattern, thestring):
  total = 0
  start = 0
  there = re.compile(pattern)
  while True:
    mo = there.search(thestring, start)
    if mo is None: return total
    total += 1
    start = 1 + mo.start()
</code></pre>

<p>Note that you do have to compile the pattern into a RE object in this case: function <code>re.search</code> does not accept a <code>start</code> argument (starting position for the search) the way <em>method</em> <code>search</code> does, so you'd have to be slicing thestring as you go -- definitely more effort than just having the next search start at the next possible distinct starting point, which is what I'm doing in this function.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Have you tried this?</p>

<pre><code> len( pattern.findall(source) )
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><pre><code>import re
len(re.findall(pattern, string_to_search))
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You can find overlapping matches by using a noncapturing subpattern:</p>

<pre><code>def count_overlapping(pattern, string):
    return len(re.findall("(?=%s)" % pattern, string))
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><pre><code>import re
print len(re.findall(r'ab',u'ababababa'))
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>To avoid creating a list of matches one may also use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/re#re.sub" rel="nofollow">re.sub</a> with a callable as replacement. It will be called on each match, incrementing internal counter.</p>

<pre><code>class Counter(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.matched = 0
    def __call__(self, matchobj):
        self.matched += 1

counter = Counter()
re.sub(some_pattern, counter, text)

print counter.matched
</code></pre>
