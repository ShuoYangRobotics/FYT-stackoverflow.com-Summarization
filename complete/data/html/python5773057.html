<h3>Question (ID-5773057):</h3><h2>A cool python script to get teen learning python excited about programming?</h2><p>So I'm teaching a friends son some python programming, just going through control of flow, basic data types/structures.</p>

<p>I want to go through a tutorial with him, and hopefully build something simple yet cool to get him excited about the power of python.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

It has been written for little noobs. It is available in the website of the link, but you can also buy the book if you prefer.<br>
There is a <a href="http://inventwithpython.com/blog/" rel="nofollow">blog</a> with extra material with nice games as the classic gorillas or tetris.  </p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>yeah,</p>

<p>ths might work.. 
im currently just for fun reading some stuff on encryption, i don't know what he is into exactly, but what he might like is to use python to be able to encrypt message's and do some string manipulations.</p>

<p>something simple to demonstrate what i mean:</p>

<pre><code>plaintext    = list('ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ')
encrytedtext = list('DEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABC')

def message(text, plain, encryp):
    dictionary = dict(zip(plain, encryp))
    newmessage = ''
    for char in text:
        try:
            newmessage += dictionary[char]
        except:
            newmessage += ' '
    print text, '\nhas been encrypted to:'
    print newmessage
</code></pre>

<p>message('SEND THE MATERIAL NOW')</p>

<p>outputs: LTFR ZIT DQZTKOQS FGV</p>

<p>not md5 strength etc, but just basic letter replacement scheme's</p>

<p><strong>now</strong> also get random sequences and then try to crack them</p>

<p>for example:</p>

<p><em>“EKNHZGUKQHIN OL ZIT LEOTFET ZIQZ EKTQZTL ZIT EOHITK
LNLZTDL XLTR ZG IORT DTLLQUTL YKGD XFOFZTFRTR KTEOHOTFZL”.</em></p>

<pre><code>Notice first that the most frequent cipher letter is T, probably replacing the E. 
The 3-character stretch ZIT which appears twice could very well be THE and since Z 
stands for T in that case, the word ZIQZ might be THAT. The 6th word now reads **EATE* 
whose completion CREATES appears as a good choice. At this point, these successive guesses yield
the following partial decryption scheme, 

 Alphabet: ACEHRST
 Substitution: QETIKLZ
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>A game is clearly a nice thing. Maybe Tetris or Snake-like?</p>

<p>While commandline stuff are great to learn as you don't have to worry about graphical stuff they might be boring for a kid.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Teach him map, reduce , lambda and other simple stuff :)
<br />
And then show him this code to find factorial of a series of number in one line.<br /></p>

<pre>
(lambda k: reduce(int.__mul__, range(1,k+1),1))(8)
</pre>

<p>He will surely get excited</p>

  <p>What is Project Euler?</p>
  
  <p>Project Euler is a series of
  challenging mathematical/computer
  programming problems that will require
  more than just mathematical insights
  to solve. Although mathematics will
  help you arrive at elegant and
  efficient methods, the use of a
  computer and programming skills will
  be required to solve most problems.</p>
