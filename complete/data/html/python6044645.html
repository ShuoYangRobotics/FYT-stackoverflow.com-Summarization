<h3>Question (ID-6044645):</h3><h2>Efficient way to get index of minimum value in long vector, python</h2><p>I have a long list of longitude values (len(Lon) = 420481), and another one of latitude values. I want to find the corresponding latitude to the minimum of the longitude.</p>

<p>I tried:</p>

<pre><code>SE_Lat = [Lat[x] for x,y in enumerate(Lon) if y == min(Lon)]
</code></pre>

<p>but this takes ages to finish.</p>

<p>Does anyone know a more efficient way?  </p>

<p>Maybe you also have a suggestions for this:
I now try to find the closest corresponding latitude to a new longitude, which is not in the original longitude vector. I tried this:</p>

<pre><code>minDiff = [min(abs(x - lon_new) for x in lons)] # not very quick, but works
[(lat,lon) for lat,lon in izip(lats,lons) if abs(lon-lon_new)==minDiff]
</code></pre>

<p>The last line throws an error, because there are multiple matches. I don't know at the moment how to find only one value, lets say the first. Any help is greatly appreciated!</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Rather than jumping right in with one of the many alternatives for solving this (which can be seen in the other answers), it's worth enumerating <em>why</em> the code in the original example is so slow.</p>

<pre><code>SE_Lat = [Lat[x] for x,y in enumerate(Lon) if y == min(Lon)]
</code></pre>

<p>We know from the OP that <code>len(Lon) == 420481</code>. Now, finding the minimum value is an O(N) operation (you have to look at every value at least once). In a list comprehension, the condition is reevaluated on <em>every iteration</em>. The above code recalculates the minimum value on every pass through the loop, blowing what should be an O(N) operation out to be O(N^2) (A mere 177 <em>billion</em> iterations in this case).</p>

<p>Simply caching the result of <code>min(Lon)</code> in a local variable and using that in the loop condition instead of recalculating it every iteration would likely bring the runtime down to an acceptable level.</p>

<p>However, the way I would personally go about it (assuming I wanted all of the latitude, longitude and index later on):</p>

<pre><code>min_longitude, min_index = min(longitude, index for index, longitude in enumerate(Lon))
min_latitude = Lat[min_index]
</code></pre>

<p>There are plenty of possibilities though, and which one is best will vary based on the exact use case.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>May I recommend numpy?</p>

<pre><code>import numpy
nplats = numpy.array(lats)
nplons = numpy.array(lons)

# this part is 20x faster than using the built-in python functions
index = numpy.argmin(nplats)

print nplats[index], nplons[index]
</code></pre>

<p>this is way faster than the min(izip()) solution (~20x using my setup when using 420481 randomly created records), although of course you'd need to store your data values in numpy to take advantage of this speed-up.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><pre><code>pairs = zip(latitudes, longitudes)
minLonPair = min(pairs, key=lambda p:p[1])
print(minLonPair[0])
</code></pre>

<p>As per Ignacio's solution, if you are using python2, you will want to use <code>izip</code> rather than <code>zip</code>. This is, however, true for everything you do in python2.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Here was my original answer:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; lats = [1,2,3,4]
&gt;&gt;&gt; lons = [5,4,8,9]
&gt;&gt;&gt; from itertools import izip
&gt;&gt;&gt; min(izip(lats,lons), key=lambda x:x[1])
(2, 4)
</code></pre>

<p>But I see that the OP seemed to be allowing for there being multiple matches at the minimum lon value, and for this, I don't think there is a one-liner. The trick is, you only want to find min(lons) once, not once for every lat,lon pair:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; lats = [1,2,3,4]
&gt;&gt;&gt; lons = [5,4,8,4]
&gt;&gt;&gt; minlon = min(lons)
&gt;&gt;&gt; [(lat,lon) for lat,lon in izip(lats,lons) if lon==minlon]
[(2, 4), (4, 4)]
</code></pre>

<p>This one-liner might work for you, since the lambda argument minlon should only be computed once:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; filter(lambda latlon,minlon=min(lons):latlon[1]==minlon, izip(lats,lons))
[(2, 4), (4, 4)]
</code></pre>

<p>Not sure how well it will work on 420481-element lists though. And for readability and long-term support, I would probably choose the more explicit 2-liner solution.</p>

<p>Last point:
Sometimes you only get one pass through a sequence, such as when it is an iterator, or the output of a generator.  To support multiple matches and take only one pass through the two lists, this was the best I could do:</p>

<pre><code>from itertools import izip

def get_lats_at_min_lon(lats, lons):
    minlon = 200
    minlats = []
    for lat,lon in izip(lats, lons):
        if lon &lt; minlon:
            minlats = [lat]
            minlon = lon
        elif lon == minlon:
            minlats.append(lat)
    return minlon, minlats

lats = iter([1,2,3,4])
lons = iter([5,4,8,4])

print get_lats_at_min_lon(lats,lons)
</code></pre>

<p>Prints:</p>

<pre><code>(4, [2, 4])
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Just first find the index:</p>

<pre><code>index = min(enumerate(Lon), key=operator.itemgetter(1))[1] 
Lat[index]
</code></pre>
