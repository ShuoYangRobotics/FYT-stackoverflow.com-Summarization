<h3>Question (ID-4825442):</h3><h2>Django i18n setlang not changing session data django_language</h2><p>I don't know what I'm doing wrong, but my session data won't change even if I submit a new language to /i18n/setlang. I am to translate to Filipino language using the code 'tl' but somehow, it just doesn't seem to work. Please help. Here are some code:</p>

<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I've investigated this a bit and here's some things to check:</p>

<p>1- Add this line in your /friend/invite/ associated view to ensure the set_lang view is working correctly.</p>

<pre><code>print request.LANGUAGE_CODE
</code></pre>

<p>If it does not output 'tl', it's probably because you're missing django locale files for your language since they are in your settings file. These files should be located under django/conf/locale/tl. There's more than one files in there and these won't be generated by the makemessages command.</p>

<p>2- If it does output 'tl', that must mean you have a tl folder in django code tree. Then I would try and make it work with a supported language first. When trying to make your example work, I wasn't able to get tagalog either. By switching to another supported language, french in my case, I've been able to troubleshoot my problems.</p>

<p>3- It would help to have the template to render /friend/invite/ view so we can see what you're translating. In my test I used a django string to avoid having to generate my own messages. I did what the documentation says and copied from english to use in tagalog. I then modified one of the strings in there. The problem is, django uses a binary file generated from the text one so only modifying the text version would still display django strings in english even if under tagalog. I discovered that when instead of using english as a basis, I used the french versions to put under tagalog.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>try adding
LANGUAGE_CODE = 'en-us'</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>it is not a caching problem?
Try to remove the cache to test..</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Did you create the translation for Filipino and put it in the correct location in your project? If so, where did you put it?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Django looks for translations by
  following this algorithm:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>First, it looks for a locale directory in the application directory
  of the view that’s being called. If it
  finds a translation for the selected
  language, the translation will be
  installed.</li>
  <li>Next, it looks for a locale directory in the project directory. If
  it finds a translation, the
  translation will be installed.</li>
  <li>Finally, it checks the Django-provided base translation in
  django/conf/locale.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Filipino isn't one of the django supported languages so you will need to add it yourself. Here is something that I got from the djangobook.com</p>

<p><a href="http://www.djangobook.com/en/2.0/chapter19/" rel="nofollow">http://www.djangobook.com/en/2.0/chapter19/</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The LocaleMiddleware can only select
  languages for which there is a
  Django-provided base translation. If
  you want to provide translations for
  your application that aren’t already
  in the set of translations in Django’s
  source tree, you’ll want to provide at
  least basic translations for that
  language. For example, Django uses
  technical message IDs to translate
  date formats and time formats — so you
  will need at least those translations
  for the system to work correctly.</p>
  
  <p>A good starting point is to copy the
  English .po file and to translate at
  least the technical messages — maybe
  the validation messages, too.</p>
  
  <p>Technical message IDs are easily
  recognized; they’re all upper case.
  You don’t translate the message ID as
  with other messages, you provide the
  correct local variant on the provided
  English value. For example, with
  DATETIME_FORMAT (or DATE_FORMAT or
  TIME_FORMAT), this would be the format
  string that you want to use in your
  language. The format is identical to
  the format strings used by the now
  template tag.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm not sure if that will solve your problem, but hopefully it will help you get there.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I would check if there is use of django.utils.translation's deactivate or activate methods in you application since I've got in troubles once because of it!</p>

<p>I also suggest you to have a look with pdb on what happens in django.views.i18n set_language view when you try to change the language.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>If I understand correctly, setting LANGUAGE_CODE to tl allows you to load your site in Filipino. If not, you probably have some configuration issue with the locale set-up.</p>

<p>To help pin point the problem, I suggest to do the following:</p>

<p>Have the language setting form point to itself when changing language. This way we have a non trivial compare between clicks. Here I am assuming that the language settings form resides the bookmarks url.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input name="next" type="hidden" value="/bookmarks/" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Next, change the title tag to a django default string that you have translated in your language. In this case <code>"Delete"</code></p>

<pre><code>&lt;title&gt;{% trans "Delete" %}&lt;/title&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You can also add another language, such as fr, to your LANGUAGES settings to see that a django provided language does work.</p>

<p>Loading the language setting page directly will allow you to change the language and then compare that the title changed (you could use another tag if you want). Using this method with your provided information, the language switch worked on my setup.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Maybe you are using ugettext when you should be using ugettext_lazy.  See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2694798/django-form-and-i18n/2694847#2694847">this answer</a>.</p>
