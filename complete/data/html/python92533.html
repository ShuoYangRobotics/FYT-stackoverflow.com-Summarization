<h3>Question (ID-92533):</h3><h2>Python module functions used in unexpected ways</h2><p>Based on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6209/split-a-string-ignoring-quoted-sections#6243">"Split a string by spaces in Python"</a>, which uses <em>shlex.split</em> to split a string with quotes smartly, I would be interested in hearing about other common tasks solved by non-obvious standard library functions.  </p>

<p>If this turns into <a href="http://www.doughellmann.com/projects/PyMOTW/" rel="nofollow">Module of The Week</a>, that's fine too.  </p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-10):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I was quite surprised to learn that you could use the bisect module to do a very fast binary search in a sequence. It's documentation doesn't say anything about it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This module provides support for maintaining a list in sorted order without having to sort the list after each insertion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The usage is very simple:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import bisect
&gt;&gt;&gt; lst = [4, 7, 10, 23, 25, 100, 103, 201, 333]
&gt;&gt;&gt; bisect.bisect_left(lst, 23)
3
</code></pre>

<p>You have to remember though, that it's quicker to linearly look for something in a list goes item by item, than sorting the list and then doing a binary search on it. The first option is O(n), the second is O(nlogn).</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Oft overlooked modules, uses and tricks:</p>

<p>collections.defaultdict(): for when you want missing keys in a dict to have a default value.</p>

<p>functools.wraps(): for writing decorators that play nicely with introspection.</p>

<p>posixpath: the os.path module for POSIX systems. You can use it for manipulating POSIX paths (including URI elements) even on Windows and other non-POSIX systems.</p>

<p>ntpath: the os.path module for Windows; usable for manipulation of Windows paths on non-Windows systems.</p>

<p>(also: macpath, for MacOS 9 and earlier, os2emxpath for OS/2 EMX, but I'm not sure if anyone still cares.)</p>

<p>pprint: more structured printing of the repr() of containers makes debugging much easier.</p>

<p>imp: all the tools you need to write your own plugin system or make Python import modules from arbitrary archives.</p>

<p>rlcompleter: getting tab-completion in the normal interactive interpreter. Just do "import readline, rlcompleter; readline.parse_and_bind('tab: complete')"</p>

<p>the PYTHONSTARTUP environment variable: can be set to the path to a file that will be executed (in the main namespace) when entering the interactive interpreter; useful for putting things in like the rlcompleter recipe above.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>I use itertools (especially cycle, repeat, chain) to make python behave more like R and in other functional / vector applications.  Often this lets me avoid the overhead and complication of Numpy.  </p>

<pre><code># in R, shorter iterables are automatically cycled
# and all functions "apply" in a "map"-like way over lists
&gt; 0:10 + 0:2
 [1]  0  2  4  3  5  7  6  8 10  9 11
</code></pre>

<p>Python
    #Normal python
    In [1]: range(10) + range(3)
    Out[1]: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, 1, 2]</p>

<pre><code>## this code is terrible, but it demos the idea.
from itertools import cycle
def addR(L1,L2):
    n = max( len(L1), len(L2))
    out = [None,]*n
    gen1,gen2 = cycle(L1), cycle(L2)
    ii = 0
    while ii &lt; n:
        out[ii] = gen1.next() + gen2.next()
        ii += 1
    return out

In [21]: addR(range(10), range(3))
Out[21]: [0, 2, 4, 3, 5, 7, 6, 8, 10, 9]

<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>I found struct.unpack to be a godsend for unpacking binary data formats after I learned of it!</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p><a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-getpass.html" rel="nofollow">getpass</a> is useful for determining the login name of the current user.</p>

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I've found <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-sched.html" rel="nofollow">sched module</a> to be helpful in cron-like activities. It simplifies things a lot. Unfortunately I found it too late. </p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Most of the other examples are merely overlooked, not unexpected uses for module.</p>

<p>fnmatch, like shlex, can be applied in unexpected ways.  fnmatch is a kind of poor-person's RE, and can be used for more than matching files, it can compare strings with the simplified wild-card patterns.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>One function I've come to appreciate is string.translate.  Its very fast at what it does, and useful anywhere you want to alter or remove characters in a string. I've just used it in a seemingly inapplicable <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/89909/in-python-how-to-i-verify-that-a-string-only-contains-letters-numbers-underscor#92000">problem</a> and found it beat all the other solutions handily.</p>

<p>The downside is that its API is a bit clunky, but this is improving in Py2.6 / Py3.0.</p>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>The <a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-pickle.html" rel="nofollow">pickle</a> module is pretty awesome</p>
<br /><b>#9</b><br /><p>complex numbers. (The complexobject.c defines a class, so technically it's not a module). Great for 2d coordinates, with easy translation/rotations etc</p>

<p>eg.</p>

<pre><code>TURN_LEFT_90= 1j
TURN_RIGHT_90= -1j

coord= 5+4j # x=5 y=4
print coord*TURN_LEFT_90
