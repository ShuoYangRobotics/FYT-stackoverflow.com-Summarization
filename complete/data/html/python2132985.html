<h3>Question (ID-2132985):</h3><h2>How to import or include data structures (e.g. a dict) into a Python file from a separate file</h2><p>I know I can include Python code from a common file using <code>import MyModuleName</code> - but how do I go about importing just a dict?</p>

<p>The problem I'm trying to solve is I have a dict that needs to be in a file in an editable location, while the actual script is in another file. The dict might also be edited by hand, by a non-programmer.</p>

<p><strong>script.py</strong></p>

<pre><code>airportName = 'BRISTOL'
myAirportCode = airportCode[airportName]
</code></pre>

<p><strong>myDict.py</strong></p>

<pre><code>airportCode = {'ABERDEEN': 'ABZ', 'BELFAST INTERNATIONAL': 'BFS', 'BIRMINGHAM INTERNATIONAL': 'BHX', 'BIRMINGHAM INTL': 'BHX', 'BOURNMOUTH': 'BOH', 'BRISTOL': 'BRS'}
</code></pre>

<p>How do I access the <code>airportCode</code> dict from within <strong>script.py</strong>?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Assuming your <code>import myDict</code> works, you need to do the following:</p>

<pre><code>from myDict import airportCode
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Well, it doesn't need to be a <code>.py</code> file.  You could just do:</p>

<pre><code>eval(open("myDict").read())
</code></pre>

<p>It's a gaping security hole, though.</p>

<p>Another module you might want to look at is <code>csv</code> for importing CSV files.  Then your users could edit it with a spreadsheet and you don't have to teach them Python syntax.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Just import it</p>

<pre><code>import script
print script.airportCode
</code></pre>

<p>or, better</p>

<pre><code>from script import airportCode
print airportCode
</code></pre>

<p>Just be careful to put both scripts on the same directory (or make a python package, a subdir with <code>__init__.py</code> file; or put the path to script.py on the PYTHONPATH; but these are "advanced options", just put it on the same directory and it'll be fine). </p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>If your dict has to be hand-editable by a non-programmer, perhaps it might make more sense using a CSV file for this. Then you editor can even use Excel.</p>

<p>So you can use:</p>

<pre><code>import csv
csvfile = csv.reader(open("airports.csv"))
airportCode = dict(csvfile)
</code></pre>

<p>to read a CSV file like</p>

<pre><code>"ABERDEEN","ABZ"
"BELFAST INTERNATIONAL","BFS"
"BIRMINGHAM INTERNATIONAL","BHX"
"BIRMINGHAM INTL","BHX"
"BOURNMOUTH","BOH"
"BRISTOL","BRS"
</code></pre>

<p>Careful: If an airport were in that list twice, the last occurrence would silently "overwrite" any previous one(s).</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>When you perform an import in python you are really just pulling in names into your current namespace. It does not really matter what those names refer to so:</p>

<pre><code>from myDict import airportCode
</code></pre>

<p>Will work regardless of whether <code>airportCode</code> is a function, class or just a field as in your case.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Use csv. Stick <code>import csv</code> with the rest of your module imports,
and then you can do as follows:</p>

<pre><code>f = open('somefile.csv')
reader = csv.DictReader(f, (airport, iatacode))
for row in reader:
   print row
</code></pre>

<p>which should give you a list of dictionaries:</p>

<pre><code>airport | iatacode
__________________
Aberdeen| ABZ
</code></pre>

<p>to create the csv file:</p>

<pre><code>f = open('somefile.csv', 'w')
writer = csv.DictWriter(f, (airport, iatacode))
for row in airportcode:
   writer.writerow()
f.close()
</code></pre>

<p>which will create a csv file with airports and IATA TLAs in two columns with airport and iatacode as the headers.</p>

<p>You can also skip the dicts and just have strings by using Reader and Writer rather than DictReader and DictWriter.</p>

<p>By default, the csv module produces excel-style csv, but you can set whatever dialect you like as a kwarg.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><pre><code>from myDict import airportCode
airportNode = 'BRISTOL'
myAirportCode = airportCode[airportName]
</code></pre>

<p>If myDict should get accessed from a Python module in a different directory, you have to provide a <code>__init__.py</code> module.</p>
