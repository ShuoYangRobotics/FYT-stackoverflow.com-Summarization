<h3>Question (ID-4563552):</h3><h2>Count letters in a word in python debug</h2><p>I am trying to count the number of times 'e' appears in a word.</p>

<pre><code>def has_no_e(word):     #counts 'e's in a word
    letters = len(word)
    count = 0
    while letters &gt;= 0:
        if word[letters-1] == 'e':
            count = count + 1
        letters = letters - 1
    print count
</code></pre>

<p>It seems to work fine except when the word ends with an 'e'.  It will count that 'e' twice.  I have no idea why.  Any help?</p>

<p>I know my code may be sloppy, I'm a beginner!  I'm just trying to figure out the logic behind what's happening.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-9):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>As others mention, you can implement the test with a simple <code>word.count('e')</code>. Unless you're doing this as a simple exercise, this is far better than trying to reinvent the wheel.</p>

<p>The problem with your code is that it counts the last character twice because you are testing index <code>-1</code> at the end, which in Python returns the last character in the string. Fix it by changing <code>while letters &gt;= 0</code> to <code>while letters &gt; 0</code>.</p>

<p>There are other ways you can tidy up your code (assuming this is an exercise in learning):</p>

<ul>
<li>Python provides a nice way of iterating over a string using a <code>for</code> loop. This is far more concise and easier to read than using a <code>while</code> loop and maintaining your own counter variable. As you've already seen here, adding complexity results in bugs. Keep it simple.</li>
<li>Most languages provide a <code>+=</code> operator, which for integers adds the amount to a variable. It's more concise than <code>count = count + 1</code>.</li>
<li>Use a parameter to define which character you're counting to make it more flexible. Define a default argument for using <code>char='e'</code> in the parameter list when you have an obvious default.</li>
<li>Choose a more appropriate name for the function. The name <code>has_no_e()</code> makes the reader think the code checks to see if the code has no e, but what it actually does is counts the occurrences of e.</li>
</ul>

<p>Putting this all together we get:</p>

<pre><code>def count_letter(word, char='e'):
    count = 0
    for c in word:
        if c == char:
            count += 1
    return count
</code></pre>

<p>Some tests:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; count_letter('tee')
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; count_letter('tee', 't')
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; count_letter('tee', 'f')
0
&gt;&gt;&gt; count_letter('wh' + 'e'*100)
100
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; word = 'eeeooooohoooooeee'
&gt;&gt;&gt; word.count('e')
6
</code></pre>

<p>Why not this?</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Why not simply</p>

<pre><code>def has_no_e(word):
    return sum(1 for letter in word if letter=="e")
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You don't have to use a while-loop.   Strings can be used for-loops in Pyhton.</p>

<pre><code>def has_no_e(word):
    count = 0
    for letter in word:
        if letter == "e":
            count += 1
    print count
</code></pre>

<p>or something simpler:</p>

<pre><code>def has_no_e(word):
    return sum(1 for letter in word if letter=="e")
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>The problem is that the last value of 'letters' in your iteration is '0', and when this happens you look at:</p>

<pre><code>  word[letters-1]
</code></pre>

<p>meaning, you look at word[-1], which in python means "last letter of the word".<br>
so you're actually counting correctly, and adding a "bonus" one if the last letter is 'e'.  </p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>It will count it twice when ending with an e because you decrement <code>letters</code> one time too many (because you loop while <code>letters &gt;= 0</code> and you should be looping while <code>letters &gt; 0</code>). When <code>letters</code> reaches zero you check <code>word[letters-1]</code> == <code>word[-1]</code> which corresponds to the last character in the word.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>Many of these suggested solutions will work fine.</p>

<p>Know that, in Python, list[-1] will return the last element of the list.</p>

<p>So, in your original code, when you were referencing word[letters-1] in a while loop constrained by letters >= 0, you would count the 'e' on the end of the word twice (once when letters was the length-1 and a second time when letters was 0).</p>

<p>For example, if my word was "Pete" your code trace would look like this (if you printed out word[letter] each loop.</p>

<p>e (for word[3])
t (for word[2])
e (for word[1])
P (for word[0])
e (for word[-1])</p>

<p>Hope this helps to clear things up and to reveal an interesting little quirk about Python.</p>
<br /><b>#7</b><br /><p>@marcog makes some excellent points;</p>

<p>in the meantime, you can do simple debugging by inserting print statements -</p>

<pre><code>def has_no_e(word):
    letters = len(word)
    count = 0
    while letters &gt;= 0:
        ch = word[letters-1]         # what is it looking at?
        if ch == 'e':
            count = count + 1
            print('{0} &lt;-'.format(ch))
        else:
            print('{0}'.format(ch))
        letters = letters - 1
    print count
</code></pre>

<p>then</p>

<pre><code>has_no_e('tease')
</code></pre>

<p>returns</p>

<pre><code>e &lt;-
s
a
e &lt;-
t
e &lt;-
3
</code></pre>

<p>from which you can see that</p>

<ol>
<li>you are going through the string in reverse order</li>
<li>it is correctly recognizing e's</li>
<li>you are 'wrapping around' to the end of the string - hence the extra e if your string ends in one</li>
</ol>
<br /><b>#8</b><br /><p>If what you really want is 'has_no_e' then the following may be more appropriate than counting 'e's and then later checking for zero,</p>

<pre><code>def has_no_e(word):
  return 'e' not in word

&gt;&gt;&gt; has_no_e('Adrian')
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; has_no_e('test')
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; has_no_e('NYSE')
True
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to check there are no 'E's either,</p>

<pre><code>def has_no_e(word):
  return 'e' not in word.lower()

&gt;&gt;&gt; has_no_e('NYSE')
False
</code></pre>
