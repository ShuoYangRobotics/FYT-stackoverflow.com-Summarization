<h3>Question (ID-4419313):</h3><h2>Are there any Web Sever modules in python?</h2><p>I am looking for a web server module for python to work as a part of an application.  </p>

<p>I tried SimpleHTTPServer but it doesn't process python files. It serves the source code as text instead which is not what I am trying to accomplish. I need the server to be a module of python and process python files and serve the return of these files.  </p>

<p>Is that possible ? Are there any (Simple,Light weight)good [or bad] modules to do that ?</p>

<p>Django is full featured, with models, views, and templates. Webpy is super light weight, but closer to the bare metal. Tornado is fast, light weight, and has a nice template language similar to Django.</p>
