<h3>Question (ID-832140):</h3><h2>How to set up Python in a web server?</h2><p>Not exactly about programming, but I need help with this.</p>

<p>I'm running a development sever with WampServer. I want to install Python (because I prefer to use Python over PHP), but it seems there isn't an obvious choice. I've read about mod_python and WSGI, and about how the latter is better.</p>

<p>However, from what I gathered (I may be wrong) you have to do more low-level stuff with WSGI than with PHP. So I researched about Django, but it seems too complex for what I want.</p>

<p>So, what recommendations would you give to a newbie in this area?</p>

<p>Again, sorry if this isn't about programming, but it's related, and this seems like a nice place to ask.</p>

<p>If you want a bare-bones Python webserver capable of some dynamic and some static content, have a look at <a href="http://www.cherrypy.org/">CherryPy</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Use <a href="http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/" rel="nofollow">mod_wsgi</a> to embed Python in Apache.  It works very, very well.</p>

<li><p>If you try to write your entire application as a WSGI-compliant application, directly accessed via mod_wsgi, you will reinvent the wheel.</p></li>
<li><p>If you try to write your application in Django, you will have stuff up and running in the space of a few hours.  Django is not "too complex" -- it's complete.  You don't have to use all of it, but -- for any realistic application -- you'll need most of it.  In particular, the built-in admin will save you mountains of programming.</p></li>

<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><a href="http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/" rel="nofollow">Werkzeug</a> is a great little python tool (werkzeug) that works with mod_wsgi for creating simple apps that dont need database backends with CMS's, such as calculators ..  They've even got a nifty <a href="http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/wiki30/" rel="nofollow">screencast</a> where they create a simple wiki in 30 minutes.  </p>

<p>You can always add something like SQLAlchemy/FormAlchemy later on if you eventually do want to have a ORM and CMS.</p>

<p>Avoid mod_python tho, it's got a pretty big memory footprint and it's actually a bit harder to install and set up than mod_wsgi, in my opinion.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>To use python with your Apache server you need to install mod_python the following links should help you out a bit.</p>

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>If it's truly a development server you're setting up, and not a machine that will be promoted to production at some point, Django has a <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/#the-development-server" rel="nofollow">built-in development webserver</a> that requires no Apache configuration. </p>

<p>Your observation about the low-level work reflects some of the differences between PHP and Python. PHP is a language designed from the start for the primary purpose of making web pages. Python is a language. Mod_Python and Mod_WSGI give the input to/output from that language a way to live in a web request/response environment. Django adds web-aware framework conveniences.</p>

<p>You mention that python seems too complex for what you want, which rather begs the question: what do you want? :-)</p>
