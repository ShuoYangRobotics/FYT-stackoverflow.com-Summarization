<h3>Question (ID-2650544):</h3><h2>How to get REALLY fast Python over a simple loop</h2><p>I'm working on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPOJ" rel="nofollow">SPOJ</a> problem, <a href="http://www.spoj.pl/problems/INTEST/" rel="nofollow">INTEST</a>.  The goal is to specify the number of test cases (n) and a divisor (k), then feed your program n numbers.  The program will accept each number on a newline of stdin and after receiving the nth number, will tell you how many were divisible by k.</p>

<p>The only challenge in this problem is getting your code to be FAST because <code>k</code> can be anything up to 10^7 and <code>n</code> can be as high as 10^9.</p>

<p>I'm trying to write it in Python and have trouble speeding it up.  Any ideas?</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit 2: I finally got it to pass at 10.54 seconds.  I used nearly all of your answers to get there, and thus it was hard to choose one as 'correct', but I believe the one I chose sums it up the best.  Thanks to you all.  Final passing code is below.</p>

<p>Edit:  I included some of the suggested updates in the included code.</p>

<hr>

<p>Extensions and third-party modules are not allowed.  The code is also run by the SPOJ judge machine, so I do not have the option of changing interpreters.</p>

<pre><code>import sys
import psyco
psyco.full()

def main():
    from sys import stdin, stdout
    first_in = stdin.readline()
    thing = first_in.split()
    n = int(thing[0])
    k = int(thing[1])
    total = 0

    list = stdin.readlines()
    for item in list:
        if int(item) % k == 0:
            total += 1

    stdout.write(str(total) + "\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
</code></pre>

<p>Generally, when using Python for spoj:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don't use "raw_input", use sys.stdin.readlines(). That can make a difference for large input. Also, if possible (and it is, for this problem), read everything at once (sys.stdin. readlines()), instead of reading line by line ("for line in sys.stdin...").</li>
<li>Similarly, don't use "print", use sys.stdout.write() - and don't forget "\n". Of course, this is only relevant when printing multiple times.</li>
<li>As S.Mark suggested, use psyco. It's available for both python2.5 and python2.6, at spoj (test it, it's there, and easy to spot: solutions using psyco usually have a ~35Mb memory usage offset). It's really simple: just add, after "import sys": import psyco; psyco.full()</li>
<li>As Justin suggested, put your code (except psyco incantation) inside a function, and simply call it at the end of your code</li>
<li>Sometimes creating a list and checking its length can be faster than creating a list and adding its components.</li>
<li>Favour list comprehensions (and generator expressions, when possible) over "for" and "while" as well. For some constructs, map/reduce/filter may also speed up your code.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using (some of) these guidelines, I've managed to pass INTEST. Still testing alternatives, though.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Use <a href="http://psyco.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">psyco</a>, it will JIT your code, very effective when there is big loop and calculations.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Looks like third party modules are not allowed,</p>

<p>So, you may try converting your loop to list comprehensions, it supposed to be run at C level, so it should be faster a little bit.</p>

<pre><code>sum(1 if int(line) % k == 0 else 0 for line in sys.stdin)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Hey, I got it to be within the time limit. I used the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Psyco with Python 2.5. </li>
<li>a simple loop with a variable to keep count in</li>
<li>my code was all in a main() function (except the psyco import) which I called.</li>
</ul>

<p>The last one is what made the difference. I believe that it has to do with variable visibility, but I'm not completely sure. My time was 10.81 seconds. You might get it to be faster with a list comprehension.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Using a list comprehension brought my time down to 8.23 seconds. Bringing the line <code>from sys import stdin, stdout</code> inside of the function shaved off a little too to bring my time down to 8.12 seconds.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>For other readers, <a href="http://www.spoj.pl/problems/INTEST/" rel="nofollow">here is the INTEST problem statement</a>.  It's intended to be an I/O throughput test.</p>

<p>On my system, I was able to shave 15% off the execution time by replacing the loop with the following:</p>

<pre><code>print sum(1 for line in sys.stdin if int(line) % k == 0)
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Just recently <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/95810/alex-martelli">Alex Martinelli</a> said that invoking code inside a function, outperforms code run in the module ( I can't find the post though ) </p>

<p>So, why don't you try: </p>

<pre><code>import sys
import psyco

psyco.full1()

def main():

    first_in = raw_input()
    thing = first_in.split()
    n = int(thing[0])
    k = int(thing[1])
    total = 0
    i = 0

    total = sum(1 if int(line) % k == 0 else 0 for line in sys.stdin)

    print total
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
</code></pre>

<p>IIRC the reason was code inside a function can be optimized. </p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>Using list comprehensions with psyco is counter productive.</p>

<p>This code:</p>

<pre><code> count = 0
 for l in sys.stdin:
     count += not int(l)%k
</code></pre>

<p>runs twice as fast as</p>

<pre><code>count = sum(not int(l)%k for l in sys.stdin)
</code></pre>

<p>when using psyco.</p>
