<h3>Question (ID-32404):</h3><h2>Can I run a Python script as a service (in Windows)? How?</h2><p>I am sketching the architecture for a set of programs that share various interrelated objects stored in a database. I want one of the programs to act as a service which provides a higher level interface for operations on these objects, and the other programs to access the objects through that service.</p>

<p>I am currently aiming for Python and the Django framework as the technologies to implement that service with. I'm pretty sure I figure how to daemonize the Python program in Linux. However, it is an optional spec item that the system should support Windows. I have little experience with Windows programming and no experience at all with Windows services.</p>

<p>Can I run Python programs as a Windows service (i. e. run it automatically without user login)? I won't necessarily have to implement this part, but I need a rough idea how it would be done in order to decide whether to design along these lines.</p>

<p><i>Edit: Thanks for all the answers so far, they are quite comprehensive. I would like to know one more thing: <b>How is Windows aware of my service? Can I manage it with the native Windows utilities?</b> Basically, what is the equivalent of putting a start/stop script in /etc/init.d?</i></p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Yes you can. I do it using the pythoncom libraries that come included with <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/activepython/index.mhtml" rel="nofollow">ActivePython</a></p>

<p>This is a basic skeleton for a simple service:</p>

<pre><code>import pythoncom
import win32serviceutil
import win32service
import win32event
import servicemanager
import socket


class AppServerSvc (win32serviceutil.ServiceFramework):
    _svc_name_ = "TestService"
    _svc_display_name_ = "Test Service"

    def __init__(self,args):
        win32serviceutil.ServiceFramework.__init__(self,args)
        self.hWaitStop = win32event.CreateEvent(None,0,0,None)
        socket.setdefaulttimeout(60)

    def SvcStop(self):
        self.ReportServiceStatus(win32service.SERVICE_STOP_PENDING)
        win32event.SetEvent(self.hWaitStop)

    def SvcDoRun(self):
        servicemanager.LogMsg(servicemanager.EVENTLOG_INFORMATION_TYPE,
                              servicemanager.PYS_SERVICE_STARTED,
                              (self._svc_name_,''))
        self.main()

    def main(self):
        pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    win32serviceutil.HandleCommandLine(AppServerSvc)
</code></pre>

<p>Your code would go in the main() method, usually with some kind of infinite loop that might be interrumped by checking a flag, that you set in the SvcStop method</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>There are a couple alternatives for installing as a service virtually any Windows executable.</p>

<h2>Method 1: Use instsrv and srvany from rktools.exe</h2>

<p>For Windows Home Server or Windows Server 2003 (works with WinXP too), the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=9D467A69-57FF-4AE7-96EE-B18C4790CFFD&amp;displaylang=en" rel="nofollow">Windows Server 2003 Resource Kit Tools</a> comes with utilities that can be used in tandem for this, called <strong>instsrv.exe</strong> and <strong>srvany.exe</strong>.  See this Microsoft KB article <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/137890" rel="nofollow">KB137890</a> for details on how to use these utils.  </p>

<p>For Windows Home Server, there is a great user friendly wrapper for these utilities named aptly "<a href="http://forum.wegotserved.com/index.php?autocom=downloads&amp;showfile=7" rel="nofollow">Any Service Installer</a>".  </p>

<h2>Method 2: Use ServiceInstaller for Windows NT</h2>

<p>There is another alternative using <a href="http://www.kcmultimedia.com/smaster/" rel="nofollow">ServiceInstaller for Windows NT</a> (<a href="http://www.kcmultimedia.com/smaster/download.html" rel="nofollow">download-able here</a>) with <a href="http://conort.googlepages.com/runanywindowsapplicationasntservice" rel="nofollow">python instructions available</a>.  Contrary to the name, it works with both Windows 2000 and Windows XP as well.  Here are some instructions for how to install a python script as a service.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Installing a Python script</strong></p>
  
  <p>Run ServiceInstaller to create a new
  service. (In this example, it is
  assumed that python is installed at
  c:\python25)</p>

<pre><code>Service Name  : PythonTest
Display Name : PythonTest 
Startup : Manual (or whatever you like)
Dependencies : (Leave blank or fill to fit your needs)
Executable : c:\python25\python.exe
Arguments : c:\path_to_your_python_script\test.py
Working Directory : c:\path_to_your_python_script
</code></pre>
  
  <p>After installing, open the Control
  Panel's Services applet, select and
  start the PythonTest service.</p>

<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You will need some "windows service wrapper", you could write it yourself or just check out <strong>srvany.exe</strong>. <a href="http://agiletesting.blogspot.com/2005/09/running-python-script-as-windows.html" rel="nofollow">Here is some tutorial how to use it</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>This <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/system/xyntservice.aspx" rel="nofollow">article</a> on Codeproject contains a program that can start other non-service applications as if they were a service.</p>

<p>Otherwise you must design a real service application which is different from a normal windows application.</p>
