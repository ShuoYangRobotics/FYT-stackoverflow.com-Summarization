<h3>Question (ID-237155):</h3><h2>Multiple mouse pointers?</h2><p>Is there a way to accept input from more than one mouse separately? I'm interested in making a multi-user application and I thought it would be great if I could have 2 or more users holding wireless mice each interacting with the app individually with a separate mouse arrow.</p>

<p>Is this something I should try to farm out to some other application/driver/os_magic? or is there a library I can use to accomplish this? Language isn't a <em>HUGE</em> deal, but C, C++, and Python are preferrable.</p>

<p>Thanks :)</p>

<p>edit:</p>

<p>Found this multi-pointer toolkit for linux (it's actually a multi-pointer x server):

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Yes.  I know of at least one program that does this, <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/kiddesign/introduction.shtml" rel="nofollow">KidPad</a>.  I think it's written in Java and was developed by <a href="http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~hourcade/" rel="nofollow">Juan Pablo Hourcade</a>, now at the University of Iowa.  You'd have to ask him how it was implemented.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/pymultimouse/" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/pymultimouse/</a> is a library using windows raw input, it worked in a test with 2 mice. </p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You could use DirectInput with C/C++ (there's probably also bindings in other languages).  You use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb205950(VS.85).aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>IDirectInput8::EnumDevices()</code></a> (using DX8; same function, different interface in other versions of DirectX) to get a list of all attached devices.  Then, you create the devices and poll them <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb205975(VS.85).aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>IDirectInputDevice8::Poll()</code></a>.  This should almost definitely work with any number of mice, keyboards, and other input devices.  MSDN has really good documentation on this.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I have this vague feeling that BeOS used to let one pair a mouse and keyboard and have separate active windows and inputs.  Wow... that was a long time ago.  I thought that it would be very interesting for "paired" programming.</p>
