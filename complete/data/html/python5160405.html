<h3>Question (ID-5160405):</h3><h2>python regex: capture parts of multiple strings that contain spaces</h2><p>I am trying to capture sub-strings from a string that looks similar to</p>

<pre><code>'some string, another string, '
</code></pre>

<p>I want the result match group to be</p>

<pre><code>('some string', 'another string')
</code></pre>

<p>my current solution</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from re import match
&gt;&gt;&gt; match(2 * '(.*?), ', 'some string, another string, ').groups()
('some string', 'another string')
</code></pre>

<p>works, but is not practicable - what I am showing here of course is massively reduced in terms of complexity compared to what I'm doing in the real project; I want to use one 'straight' (non-computed) regex pattern only. Unfortunately, my attempts have failed so far:</p>

<p>This doesn't match (None as result), because {2} is applied to the space only, not to the whole string:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; match('.*?, {2}', 'some string, another string, ')
</code></pre>

<p>adding parentheses around the repeated string has the comma and space in the result</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; match('(.*?, ){2}', 'some string, another string, ').groups()
('another string, ',)
</code></pre>

<p>adding another set of parantheses does fix that, but gets me too much:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; match('((.*?), ){2}', 'some string, another string, ').groups()
('another string, ', 'another string')
</code></pre>

<p>adding a non-capturing modifier improves the result, but still misses the first string</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; match('(?:(.*?), ){2}', 'some string, another string, ').groups()
('another string',)
</code></pre>

<p>I feel like I'm close, but I can't really seem to find the proper way.</p>

<p>Can anyone help me ? Any other approaches I'm not seeing ?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update after the first few responses:</strong></p>

<p>First up, thank you very much everyone, your help is greatly appreciated! :-)</p>

<p>As I said in the original post, I have omitted a lot of complexity in my question for the sake of depicting the actual core problem. For starters, in the project I am working on, I am parsing large amounts of files (currently tens of thousands per day) in a number (currently 5, soon ~25, possibly in the hundreds later) of different line-based formats. There is also XML, JSON, binary and some other data file formats, but let's stay focussed.</p>

<p>In order to cope with the multitude of file formats and to exploit the fact that many of them are line-based, I have created a somewhat generic Python module that loads one file after the other, applies a regex to every line and returns a large data structure with the matches. This module is a prototype, the production version will require a C++ version for performance reason which will be connected over Boost::Python and will probably add the subject of regex dialects to the list of complexities.</p>

<p>Also, there are not 2 repetitions, but an amount varying between currently zero and 70 (or so), the comma is not always a comma and despite what I said originally, some parts of the regex pattern will have to be computed at runtime; let's just say I have reason to try and reduce the 'dynamic' amount and have as much 'fixed' pattern as possible.</p>

<p>So, in a word: <strong>I must use regular expressions.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Attempt to rephrase:</strong> I think the core of the problem boils down to: Is there a Python RegEx notation that e.g. involves curly braces repetitions and allows me to capture</p>

<pre><code>'some string, another string, '
</code></pre>

<p>into</p>

<pre><code>('some string', 'another string')
</code></pre>

<p>?</p>

<p>Hmmm, that probably narrows it down too far - but then, any way you do it is wrong :-D</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Second attempt to rephrase:</strong> Why do I not see the first string ('some string') in the result ? Why does the regex produce a match (indicating there's gotta be 2 of something), but only returns 1 string (the second one) ?</p>

<p>The problem remains the same even if I use non-numeric repetition, i.e. using + instead of {2}:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; match('(?:(.*?), )+', 'some string, another string, ').groups()
('another string',)
</code></pre>

<p>Also, it's not the second string that's returned, it is the last one:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; match('(?:(.*?), )+', 'some string, another string, third string, ').groups()
('third string',)
</code></pre>

<p>Again, thanks for your help, never ceases to amaze me how helpful peer review is while trying to find out what I actually want to know...</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Unless there's much more to this problem than you've explained, I don't see the point in using regexes. This is <em>very</em> simple to deal with using basic string methods:</p>

<pre><code>[s.strip() for s in mys.split(',') if s.strip()]
</code></pre>

<p>Or if it has to be a tuple:</p>

<pre><code>tuple(s.strip() for s in mys.split(',') if s.strip())
</code></pre>

<p>The code is more readable too. Please tell me if this fails to apply.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Ok, there is indeed more to this problem than it initially seemed. Leaving this for historical purposes though. (Guess I'm not 'disciplined' :) )</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>As described, I think this regex works fine:</p>

<pre><code>import re
thepattern = re.compile("(.+?)(?:,|$)") # lazy non-empty match 
thepattern.findall("a, b, asdf, d")     # until comma or end of line
# Result:
Out[19]: ['a', ' b', ' asdf', ' d']
</code></pre>

<p>The key here is to use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/re.html" rel="nofollow"><code>findall</code></a> rather than <code>match</code>. The phrasing of your question suggests you prefer <code>match</code>, but it isn't the right tool for the job here -- it is designed to return exactly one string for each corresponding group <code>(</code> <code>)</code> in the regex. Since your 'number of strings' is variable, the right approach is to use either <code>findall</code> or <code>split</code>.</p>

<p>If this isn't what you need, then please make the question more specific.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> And if you must use tuples rather than lists:</p>

<pre><code>tuple(Out[19])
# Result
Out[20]: ('a', ' b', ' asdf', ' d')
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><pre><code>import re

regex = " *((?:[^, ]| +[^, ])+) *, *((?:[^, ]| +[^, ])+) *, *"

print re.match(regex, 'some string, another string, ').groups()
# ('some string', 'another string')
print re.match(regex, ' some string, another string, ').groups()
# ('some string', 'another string')
print re.match(regex, ' some string , another string, ').groups()
# ('some string', 'another string')
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>No offense, but you obviously have a lot to learn about regexes, and what you're going to learn, ultimately, is that regexes can't handle this job.  I'm sure this <em>particular</em> task is doable with regexes, but then what?  You say you have potentially <strong>hundreds</strong> of different file formats to parse!  You even mentioned JSON and XML, which are fundamentally incompatible with regexes.</p>

<p>Do yourself a favor: forget about regexes and learn <a href="http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/" rel="nofollow">pyparsing</a> instead.  Or skip Python entirely and use a standalone parser generator like <a href="http://www.antlr.org/" rel="nofollow">ANTLR</a>.  In either case, you'll probably find that grammars for most of your file formats have already been written.</p>

<p>I don't think there is such a notation.</p>

<p>But regexes are not a matter of only NOTATION , that is to say the RE string used to define a regex. It is also a matter of TOOLS, that is to say functions. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unfortunately, I can't use findall as
  the string from the initial question
  is only a part of the problem, the
  real string is a lot longer, so
  findall only works if I do multiple
  regex findalls / matches / searches.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should give more information without delaying: we could understand more rapidly what are the constraints. Because in my opinion, to answer to your problem as it has been exposed, <strong>findall()</strong> is indeed OK:</p>

<pre><code>import re

for line in ('string one, string two, ',
             'some string, another string, third string, ',
             # the following two lines are only one string
             'Topaz, Turquoise, Moss Agate, Obsidian, '
             'Tigers-Eye, Tourmaline, Lapis Lazuli, '):

    print re.findall('(.+?), *',line)
</code></pre>

<p>Result</p>

<pre><code>['string one', 'string two']
['some string', 'another string', 'third string']
['Topaz', 'Turquoise', 'Moss Agate', 'Obsidian', 'Tigers-Eye', 'Tourmaline', 'Lapis Lazuli']
</code></pre>

<p>Now, since you "have omitted a lot of complexity" in your question, <strong>findall()</strong> could incidentally be unsufficient to hold this complexity. Then <strong>finditer()</strong> will be used because it allows more flexibility in the selection of groups of a match</p>

<pre><code>import re

for line in ('string one, string two, ',
             'some string, another string, third string, ',
             # the following two lines are only one string
             'Topaz, Turquoise, Moss Agate, Obsidian, '
             'Tigers-Eye, Tourmaline, Lapis Lazuli, '):

    print [ mat.group(1) for mat in re.finditer('(.+?), *',line) ]
</code></pre>

<p>gives the same result and can be complexified by writing other expression in place of <strong>mat.group(1)</strong></p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>In order to sum this up, it seems I am already using the best solution by constructing the regex pattern in a 'dynamic' manner:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from re import match
&gt;&gt;&gt; match(2 * '(.*?), ', 'some string, another string, ').groups()
('some string', 'another string')
</code></pre>

<p>the </p>

<pre><code>2 * '(.*?)
</code></pre>

<p>is what I mean by dynamic. The alternative approach</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; match('(?:(.*?), ){2}', 'some string, another string, ').groups()
('another string',)
</code></pre>

<p>fails to return the desired result due to the fact that (as Glenn and Alan kindly explained) </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>with match, the captured content gets overwritten
  with each repetition of the capturing
  group</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks for your help everyone! :-)</p>
