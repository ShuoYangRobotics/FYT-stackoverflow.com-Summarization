<h3>Question (ID-1503072):</h3><h2>How to check if permutations have equal parity?</h2><p>I am looking for a way to check if 2 <strong>permutations</strong> (represented by lists) are of the <strong>same <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity%5Fof%5Fa%5Fpermutation" rel="nofollow">parity</a></strong>. Note that I am not interested if they are <em>even</em> or <em>odd</em> parity, just the equality.</p>

<p>I am new to Python and my naive solution is given below as a reply. I am looking forward to Python gurus showing me some cool tricks to achieve the same in lesser, more elegant Python code.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-8):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Here is my tweak of your code</p>

<ul>
<li>Use list() to copy perm1 - this means you can pass tuples, etc into the function, making it more generic</li>
<li>Use enumerate() in the for loop instead of len(..) and array lookups for neater code</li>
<li>Make a perm1_map and keep it up to date to stop an expensive O(N) search on perm1, and an expensive list slice</li>
<li>return the boolean directly rather than the if ... return True else return False</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is it</p>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>If we combine both permutations, the result will have even parity when each permutation has the same parity, and odd parity if they have different parity. So if we solve the <strong>parity problem</strong> it's trivial to compare two different permutations.</p>

<p><strong>Parity</strong> can be determined as follows: pick an arbitrary element, find the position that the permutation moves this to, repeat until you get back to the one you started with. You have now found a cycle: the permutation rotates all these elements round by one position. You need one swap less than the number of elements in the cycle to undo it. Now pick another element you haven't dealt with yet and repeat until you've seen every element. Observe that in total you needed one swap per element minus one swap per cycle.</p>

<p>Time complexity is O(N) in the size of the permutation. Note that although we have a loop within a loop, the inner loop can only ever iterate once for any element in the permutation.</p>

<pre><code>def parity(permutation):
    permutation = list(permutation)
    length = len(permutation)
    elements_seen = [False] * length
    cycles = 0
    for index, already_seen in enumerate(elements_seen):
        if already_seen:
            continue
        cycles += 1
        current = index
        while not elements_seen[current]:
            elements_seen[current] = True
            current = permutation[current]
    return (length-cycles) % 2 == 0

def arePermsEqualParity(perm0, perm1):
    perm0 = list(perm0)
    return parity([perm0[i] for i in perm1])
</code></pre>

<p>Also, just for fun, here's a much less efficient but much shorter implementation of the parity function based on the definition in Wikipedia (returning True for even and False for odd):</p>

<pre><code>def parity(p):
    return sum(
        1 for (x,px) in enumerate(p)
          for (y,py) in enumerate(p)
          if x&lt;y and px&gt;py
        )%2==0

<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>My intuition tells me that, just counting the differences between the two permutations will give you one more than the number of swaps need to get from one to the other.  This in turn will give you the parity.</p>

<p>This means that you don't need to do the swaps in your code at all.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>ABCD, BDCA.
</code></pre>

<p>There are three differences, hence two swaps are needed to permute one into the other, hence you have even parity.</p>

<p>Another:</p>

<pre><code>ABCD, CDBA.
</code></pre>

<p>There are four differences, hence three swaps, hence odd parity. </p>
