<h3>Question (ID-403421):</h3><h2>How to sort a list of objects in Python, based on an attribute of the objects?</h2><p>I've got a list of Python objects that I'd like to sort by an attribute of the objects themselves.  The list looks like:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; ut
[&lt;Tag: 128&gt;, &lt;Tag: 2008&gt;, &lt;Tag: &lt;&gt;, &lt;Tag: actionscript&gt;, &lt;Tag: addresses&gt;, &lt;Tag: aes&gt;, &lt;Tag: ajax&gt; ...]
</code></pre>

<p>Each object has a count:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; ut[1].count
1L
</code></pre>

<p>I need to sort the list by number of counts descending.</p>

<p>I've seen several methods for this, but I'm looking for best practice in Python.</p>

ut.sort(key=lambda x: x.count, reverse=True)

# To return a new list, use the sorted() built-in function...
newlist = sorted(ut, key=lambda x: x.count, reverse=True)
</code></pre>

<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>A way that can be fastest, especially if your list has a lot of records, is to use <code>operator.attrgetter("count")</code>. However, this might run on an pre-operator version of Python, so it would be nice to have a fallback mechanism. You might want to do the following, then:</p>

<pre><code>try: import operator
except ImportError: cmpfun= lambda x: x.count # use a lambda if no operator module
else: cmpfun= operator.attrgetter("count") # use operator since it's faster than lambda

ut.sort(key=cmpfun, reverse=True) # sort in-place
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>It looks much like a list of Django ORM model instances.</p>

<p>Why not sort them on query like this:</p>

<pre><code>ut = Tag.objects.order_by('-count')
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Readers should notice that the key= method:</p>

<pre><code>ut.sort(key=lambda x: x.count, reverse=True)
</code></pre>

<p>is many times faster than adding rich comparison operators to the objects. I was surprised to read this (page 485 of "Python in a Nutshell"). You can confirm this by running tests on this little program:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
import random

class C:
    def __init__(self,count):
        self.count = count

    def __cmp__(self,other):
        return cmp(self.count,other.count)

longList = [C(random.random()) for i in xrange(1000000)] #about 6.1 secs

longList.sort() #about 52 - 6.1 = 46 secs
longList.sort(key = lambda c: c.count) #about 9 - 6.1 = 3 secs
</code></pre>

<p>My, very minimal, tests show the first sort is more than 10 times slower, but the book says it is only about 5 times slower in general. The reason they say is due to the highly optimizes sort algorithm used in python (<strong>timsort</strong>).</p>

<p>Still, its very odd that .sort(lambda) is faster than plain old .sort(). I hope they fix that.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Add rich comparison operators to the object class, then use sort() method of the list.<br>
See <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html#object.__lt__" rel="nofollow">rich comparison in python</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Although this method would work, I think solution from Triptych is better suited to your case because way simpler.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><pre><code>from operator import attrgetter
ut.sort(key = attrgetter('count'), reverse = True)
</code></pre>
