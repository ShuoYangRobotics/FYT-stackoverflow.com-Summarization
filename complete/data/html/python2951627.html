<h3>Question (ID-2951627):</h3><h2>How do I manage a Python based daemon on Linux?</h2><p>I have a working Python based program that I want to run as a daemon. Currently I'm doing it in a very hackish manner of starting it in with <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/" rel="nofollow"><code>screen</code></a><code>-d -m name</code> session and killing it with <code>pkill -9 -f name</code>.</p>

<p>Eventually I'm doing to have to move this to the better system we use here (thus <strong>I'm not willing to modify the program</strong>) but in the interim, I'm looking for a cleaner way to do this.</p>

<p>My current thinking is kick it off as a background task from an inti.d script but how do I write the part to bring it back down?</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>On linux there is a <a href="http://linuxreviews.org/man/start-stop-daemon/" rel="nofollow">start-stop-daemon</a> utility as part of the init.d tools.</p>

<p>It is very flexible and allows different ways for capturing the pid of your server.</p>

<p>There is also a file /etc/init.d/skeleton  which can serve as a basis for your own init.d script.</p>

<p>If your target platform is debian based, it makes sense to create a debina package to deploy it as it also helps getting a daemon properly integrated in the rest of the system. And it is not too complicated (if you have done it ten times before ;-)</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>See <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3143/" rel="nofollow"><strong>PEP 3143 -- Standard daemon process library</strong></a> </p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>If you want to do it with code in python, this is a pretty standard C-method that was ported to python that I use.  It works flawlessly, and you can even choose a file output.</p>

<pre><code>import os
import signal
def daemonize(workingdir='.', umask=0,outfile='/dev/null'):
#Put in background
pid = os.fork()
if pid == 0:
    #First child
    os.setsid()
    pid = os.fork() #fork again
    if pid == 0:
        os.chdir(workingdir)
        os.umask(umask)
    else:
        os._exit(0)
else:
    os._exit(0)

#Close all open resources
try:
    os.close(0)
    os.close(1)
    os.close(2)
except:
    raise Exception("Unable to close standard output. Try running with 'nodaemon'")
    os._exit(1)

#Redirect output
os.open(outfile, os.O_RDWR | os.O_CREAT)
os.dup2(0,1)
os.dup2(0,2)
</code></pre>

<p>Then, you can use signals to catch when a kill-signal was sent to the program and exit nicely.  Example from <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/signal.html" rel="nofollow">Python Docs</a></p>

<pre><code>import signal, os

def handler(signum, frame):
    print 'Signal handler called with signal', signum
    raise IOError("Couldn't open device!")

# Set the signal handler and a 5-second alarm
signal.signal(signal.SIGALRM, handler)
signal.alarm(5)

# This open() may hang indefinitely
fd = os.open('/dev/ttyS0', os.O_RDWR)

signal.alarm(0)          # Disable the alarm
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>There are modules that could be used to daemonize a python script.</p>

<p><a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-daemon" rel="nofollow">python-daemon</a> implements the well-behaved daemon specification (PEP 3143).</p>

<p>Also <a href="https://github.com/kasun/YapDi" rel="nofollow">this module</a> recently came up on github which seems more pythonic and easy to use.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Starting it with an <code>init.d</code> style script is a good way. You take it down with POSIX Signals ... See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2163194/signal-handling-in-python">StackOverflow, Signal handling in Python</a>.</p>
