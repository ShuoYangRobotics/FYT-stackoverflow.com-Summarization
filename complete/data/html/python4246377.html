<h3>Question (ID-4246377):</h3><h2>In python, how could I make this three line code into a one line code?</h2><p>Here's the code</p>

<pre><code>from sys import argv
script,from_file, to_file = argv
open(to_file,'w').write(open(from_file).read())
</code></pre>

<p>I'm new to python, and I'm <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/index" rel="nofollow">Learning Python the Hard Way</a>, on the extra credit for one problem, it says the writer of the book was able to make the code one line long, so I managed to get it down to 3 lines, but I'm stuck.</p>

<p>Care to help?</p>

<p>Oh, and the code copies the contents of one file to another, or it is meant to.  That's my goal.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>It is possible to do this as one <em>expression</em> i.e. without needing semicolons:</p>

<pre><code>__import__('shutil').copy(__import__('sys').argv[1], __import__('sys').argv[2])
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>open(__import__('sys').argv[2], "w").write(open(__import__('sys').argv[1]).read())
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Of course, nobody in their right mind would prefer this to your sample code. The only change I would make is that there's no reason to assign the file names to temporary variables:</p>

<pre><code>from sys import argv
open(argv[1],'w').write(open(argv[2]).read())
</code></pre>

<p>A more Pythonic way of writing this would be:</p>

<pre><code>import sys
with open(sys.argv[1]) as src, open(sys.argv[2]) as dest:
    for line in src:
        dest.write(line)
</code></pre>

<p>and then you could start using <a href="http://docs.python.org/dev/library/argparse.html" rel="nofollow"><code>argparse</code></a> to make the command-line reading more robust...</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>You can use semicolon to keep the import statement on the same line. And reference the items in argv directly instead of using variables.</p>

<pre><code>from sys import argv; open(argv[2],'w').write(open(argv[1]).read())
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Two things that you need to know:</p>

<p>1) You can include multiple python statements on the same line by separating them with semicolons</p>

<p>2) You don't need to move the command line parameters into separate variables in order to use them.</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>To avoid the multiple <code>__import__</code>of @katrielalex you could do:</p>

<p><code>(lambda a:open(a[2],"w").write(open(a[1]).read()))(__import__('sys').argv)</code></p>

<p>It's shorter, but it's ugly.  </p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>You can get rid of the second line and reference <code>argv</code> directly in the third. To combine the remaining lines, you could use a semicolon. It's kind of cheating, but I don't see any better solution as you must import sys.</p>

<pre><code>from sys import argv; open(argv[2],'w').write(open(argv[1]).read())
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><pre><code>open(argv[2], 'w').write(open(argv[1]).read())
</code></pre>

<p>i guess the import line is not counted...</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>i hope the import line is not counted, because it means your manual encourage to use semicolons with import statement, that's horrible... you should avoid this in python..you must ;)</p>

<p>PEP8 also discourage to use lines like</p>

<pre><code>import os, sys
</code></pre>

<p>instead of the right way:</p>

<pre><code>import os
import sys
</code></pre>

<p>so, don't use semicolons</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><pre><code>import sys

open(sys.argv[3], 'w').write(open(sys.argv[2]).read())
</code></pre>

<p>is probably the best you can do.</p>
