<h3>Question (ID-2084875):</h3><h2>Vim's Omnicompletion with Python just doesn't work</h2><p>I've searched around for an hour, both on Stack Overflow and elsewhere. Alas! Please help. Vim's omnicompletion just <em>doesn't work</em>.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I have Vim 7.2 compiled with Python support.</p></li>
<li><p><code>filetype plugin on</code> is in my <code>.vimrc</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>When a <code>.py</code> file is open, <code>:echo &amp;omnifunc</code> prints <code>pythoncomplete#Complete</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>I'm working with a large project and I have a <code>tags</code> file generated with <code>exhuberant-ctags</code>. It's in Vim's <code>ctags</code> path. I can test it by typing <kbd>^]</kbd> on a symbol and I'm then taken to the symbols' definition.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Update 1:</strong> All of my project's code is in the python-in-Vim's path. I can <code>:python import myproject</code> successfully.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now, anywhere I try <kbd>C-x C-o</kbd>, all I get is:</p>

<pre><code>-- Omni completion (^O^N^P) Pattern not found
</code></pre>

<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> When I type <kbd>C-x C-o C-n</kbd> at the module-level, Vim displays a completion popup with a few module-level constants from other modules in my project. But it's only constants (symbols capital letters) and the completion still doesn't work anywhere else.</p>

<p><strong>Update 3:</strong> I've found that <kbd>C-x C-o</kbd> at the top of the file starts some kind of omnicompletion, and completion for <code>pprint.</code> brings up the menu and quick-reference of everything in the <code>pprint</code> module. However, none of my own module's imports are being completed.</p>

<p><strong>Update 4, one year later:</strong> I gave up and learned Emacs. I have been to the dark site, the mystical land of intrigue and spice, and I say to thee that I have found The Way.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-6):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>What module contains the symbol you are trying to complete? Is it in the python stdlib? Or is it a third-party module?</p>

<p>Make sure that the module/package is in the PYTHONPATH.</p>

<p>In Vim, do:</p>

<pre><code>:python import sys
:python print sys.path
</code></pre>

<p>To add the module's directory:</p>

<pre><code>:python sys.path.append("/path/to/directory/")
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>Since you were prudent and made certain your code is reachable by the PYTHONPATH, per codeape's suggestion, is there a possibility that you are running into the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/vim_dev/browse_thread/thread/58191d176ebd9722/d9cd31cee304b7df?pli=1" rel="nofollow"><code>import</code> bug for Vim Python omni-complete</a>? This bug still exists as of Vim 7.2.245.</p>

<p>Essentially, if <strong>any</strong> import statement fails in the file you are working in, regardless of whether it's wrapped in a <code>Try-Except</code> clause, it will completely break omni-completion. It should be fairly easy to check for this, since most imports occur at the very beginning of the file.</p>

<p>If you do decide that this bug is the cause of your troubles, your options include:</p>

<ul>
<li>making sure that the modules you import are on the system path, not just the project files</li>
<li>commenting out any <code>import</code> statements that fail</li>
<li>fixing the bug</li>
<li>using a different editor; Netbeans IDE has Python support, and the <a href="http://jvi.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">jVi plugin</a> is rather good if you're a Vim addict like myself (don't let the 1990s look of the home page fool you)</li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Sounds like the questioner has long since gone to the dark side*, but for what it's worth I've just had this symptom, and in my case the cause was that a module I was using relied on Python 2.7 but my version of Vim was compiled with Python 2.5.</p>

<p>To diagnose I tried <code>:python import mymodule</code>, which failed with an error about importing a dependent module. Then <code>:python import dependentmodule</code> which failed with the next step in the chain. And so on &amp; so on, until it failed trying to import a system module that was new since Python 2.7. Problem found.</p>

<p>To solve, I just did <code>sudo port install vim +python27</code>. But that's for OSX. YMMV.</p>

<p>(* I'm kidding. Emacs users are our friends. It's the people programming in Notepad we all have to save...)</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>Have you tried using <code>&lt;C_x&gt;&lt;C-]&gt;</code> ?</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p><code>c-x c-n</code> works to get the list of members of an object.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I used supertab (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1643)</p>

<p>Since C-x C-o is a bit frustrating to use</p>

<p>in .vimrc:</p>

<pre><code>let g:SuperTabDefaultCompletionType = "&lt;c-x&gt;&lt;c-o&gt;"
</code></pre>

<p>then just use Tabb for omnicompletion</p>
