<h3>Question (ID-995165):</h3><h2>Using python regex to extract namespaces from C++ sources</h2><p>I am trying to extract the namespaces defined in C++ files.<br />
Basically, if my C++ file contains:</p>

<pre>
namespace n1 {
  ...
  namespace n2 { ... } // end namespace n2 
  ...
  namespace n3 { ...} //end namespace n3 
  ...
} //end namespace n1
</pre>

<p>I want to be able to retrieve: n1, n1::n2, n1::n3.</p>

<p>Does someone have any suggestion of how I could do that using python-regex? </p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

However, to determine the nesting level you will have to keep track of the curly bracket nesting level in the source file. This is a parsing problem, one that cannot be solved (sanely) with regular expressions. Also, you may have to deal with any C preprocessor directives in the file which can definitely affect parsing.</p>

<p>C++ is a notoriously tricky language to parse completely, but you may be able to get by with a tokeniser and a curly bracket counter.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>The need is simple enough that you may not need a complex parser. You need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>extract the namespace names</li>
<li>count the open/close braces to keep track of where your namespace is defined.</li>
</ul>

<p>This simple approach works if the other conditions are met:</p>

<ul>
<li>you don't get spurious namespace like strings inside comments or inside strings</li>
<li>you don't get unmatched open/closeing braces inside comments or strings</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't think this is too much asking from your source.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>You cannot completely ignore preprocessor directives, as they may introduce additional namespaces. I have seen a lot of code like:</p>

<pre><code>#define __NAMESPACE_SYSTEM__ namespace system

__NAMESPACE_SYSTEM__ {
   // actual code here...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Yet, I don't see any reason for using such directives, other than defeating regular expression parsing strategy...</p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>You could write a basic lexer for it. It's not that hard.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>Most of the time when someone asks how to do something with regex, they're doing something very wrong.  I don't think this case is different.</p>

<p>If you want to parse c++, you need to use a c++ parser.  There are many things that can be done that will defeat a regex but still be valid c++.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>That is what I did earlier today:    </p>

<ul>
<li>Extract the comment out of the C++ files</li>
<li>Use regex to extract the namespace definition</li>
<li>Use a simple string search to get the open &amp; close braces positions</li>
</ul>

<p>The various sanity check added show that I am successfully processing 99.925% of my files (5 failures ouf of 6678 files). The issues are due to mismatches in numbers of { and } cause by few '{' or '}' in strings, and unclean usage of the preprocessor instruction.</p>

<p>However, I am only dealing with header files, and I own the code. That limits the number of scenari that could cause some issues and I can manually modify the ones I don't cover.</p>

<p>Of course I know there are plenty of cases where it would fail but it is probably enough for what I want to achieve.</p>

<p>Thanks for your answers.</p>
