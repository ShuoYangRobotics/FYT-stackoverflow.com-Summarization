<h3>Question (ID-394039):</h3><h2>Which Python GUI framework?</h2><p>I am a newbie at Python. I see a few GUIs listed in the <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming" rel="nofollow">Python wiki</a> but I would like to know what you think is the easiest to use. I have 2 requirements</p>

<ol>
<li>Have buttons, tabs and a textbox</li>
<li>Be able to load an image in memory/from the web (I am using pyCURL to download the
temp image(s))</li>
</ol>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>I believe that <a href="http://wxpython.org/" rel="nofollow">wxPython</a> is your best option.  The GUI that comes with the Python standard library (<a href="http://docs.python.org/library/tkinter.html" rel="nofollow">Tkinter</a>) is pretty nice, but doesn't support tabs out of the box.  There's an extension called <a href="http://tix.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">Tix</a> which does, but it is a cross-language library which is well documented for Tcl and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/287312/tix-documentation-for-python">poorly documented for Python</a>.</p>

<p>I've been using wxPython recently and have been very impressed.  It's easy to use, is extremely well documented for both Python and C++, and supports your requirements.</p>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p><a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt</a></p>

<p>Qt used with C++ is very nice, but I cannot say what PyQT is like since I never used it.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>Well, if we are voting, I would vote for <a href="http://pygtk.org/" rel="nofollow">PyGTK</a>. It has the</p>

<ul>
<li>best API,</li>
<li>fantastic documentation and tutorials,</li>
<li>a number of helper libraries,</li>
<li>a thriving community,</li>
<li>Glade user interface designing (edit: nosklo)</li>
<li>and not too hard for beginners.</li>
</ul>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>PyQT. <a href="http://www.rkblog.rk.edu.pl/w/p/introduction-pyqt4/" rel="nofollow">Here is a small tutorial</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>I already answered <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/360602/what-gui-toolkit-looks-best-for-a-native-laf-for-python-in-windows-and-linux#361672">here</a> + under Wx you have something called XRC which is very similar to Glade.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>I use wxPython quite a bit for my GUI needs; the simplest reason for me is that I've found it much easier to distribute wxPython apps than PyQt apps.  (Additionally, <a href="http://code.enthought.com/projects/traits/" rel="nofollow">Traits</a> are better supported under wxPython that Qt, but that is changing.)  That being said, XRC and Boa Constructor and Glade (which can also build wxPython GUIs with <a href="http://wxglade.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">wxGlade</a>) are all way, way behind Qt designer in sophistication and reliability.</p>

<p>So, because I was willing to spend a bit of time writing the layout code, etc, and because I had to distribute to several platforms, I went with wxPython.  But if you have a more controlled deployment environment and you want to design graphically, PyQt might be a better fit.</p>
<br /><b>#6</b><br /><p>It would depend on your background as a programmer. If you're used to functional programming, I would go with Tkinter. If you're used to event-based programming, I would use wxPython.</p>
