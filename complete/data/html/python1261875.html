<h3>Question (ID-1261875):</h3><h2>Python nonlocal statement</h2><p>What does it do, in Python 3.0? There's no documentation on the official Python website and help("nonlocal") does not work, either.</p>
<br /><h3>Answers (Total-7):</h3><b>#0</b><br /><p>Compare this, without using nonlocal:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def outer():
       x = 1
       def inner():
           x = 2
           print("inner:", x)
       inner()
       print("outer:", x)


&gt;&gt;&gt; outer()
inner: 2
outer: 1
</code></pre>

<p>To this, using nonlocal:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def outer():
       x = 1
       def inner():
           nonlocal x
           x = 2
           print("inner:", x)
       inner()
       print("outer:", x)


&gt;&gt;&gt; outer()
inner: 2
outer: 2
</code></pre>
<br /><b>#1</b><br /><p>It's documented in the Language Reference <a href="http://docs.python.org/3.1/reference/simple%5Fstmts.html#the-nonlocal-statement" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<br /><b>#2</b><br /><p>In short, it lets you assign values to a variable in an outer (but non-global) scope.  See <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3104/" rel="nofollow">PEP 3104</a> for all the gory details. </p>
<br /><b>#3</b><br /><p>A google search for "python nonlocal" turned up the Proposal, <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3104/" rel="nofollow">PEP 3104</a>, which fully describes the syntax and reasoning behind the statement.  in short, it works in exactly the same way as the <code>global</code> statement, except that it is used to refer to variables that are neither global nor local to the function. </p>

<p>Here's a brief example of what you can do with this.  The counter generator can be rewritten to use this so that it looks more like the idioms of languages with closures.</p>

<pre><code>def make_counter():
    count = 0
    def counter():
        nonlocal count
        count += 1
        return count
    return counter
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, you could write this as a generator, like:</p>

<pre><code>def counter_generator():
    count = 0
    while True:
        count += 1
        yield count
</code></pre>

<p><em>But</em> while this is perfectly idiomatic python, it seems that the first version would be a bit more obvious for beginners.  Properly using generators, by calling the returned function, is a common point of confusion.  The first version explicitly returns a function.</p>
<br /><b>#4</b><br /><p>@ooboo:</p>

<p>It takes the one "closest" to the point of reference in the source code.
This is called "Lexical Scoping" and is standard for >40 years now.</p>

<p>Python's class members are really in a dictionary called <code>__dict__</code> and will never be reached by lexical scoping.</p>

<p>If you don't specify <code>nonlocal</code> but do <code>x = 7</code>, it will create a new local variable "x".
If you do specify <code>nonlocal</code>, it will find the "closest" "x" and assign to that.
If you specify <code>nonlocal</code> and there is no "x", it will give you an error message.</p>

<p>The keyword <code>global</code> has always seemed strange to me since it will happily ignore all the other "x" except for the outermost one. Weird.</p>
<br /><b>#5</b><br /><p>My personal understanding of the "nonlocal" statement (and do excuse me as I am new to Python and Programming in general) is that the "nonlocal" is a way to use the Global functionality within iterated functions rather than the body of the code itself. A Global statement between functions if you will.</p>

The <code>nonlocal</code> statement</p>

<hr>

<p>nonlocal_stmt ::= "nonlocal" identifier ("," identifier)*</p>

<p>The <code>nonlocal</code> statement causes the listed identifiers to refer to
previously bound variables in the nearest enclosing scope.  This is
important because the default behavior for binding is to search the
local namespace first.  The statement allows encapsulated code to
rebind variables outside of the local scope besides the global
(module) scope.</p>

<p>Names listed in a <code>nonlocal</code> statement, unlike to those listed in a
<code>global</code> statement, must refer to pre-existing bindings in an
enclosing scope (the scope in which a new binding should be created
cannot be determined unambiguously).</p>

<p>Names listed in a <code>nonlocal</code> statement must not collide with pre-
existing bindings in the local scope.</p>
