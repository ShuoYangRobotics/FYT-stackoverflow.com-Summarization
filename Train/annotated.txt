What is your single favorite feature in ReSharper?<#>Q
My whole department has owned individual copies of ReSharper for about a year, but I find I'm one of only two people that actually use any of its features regularly.<#>NQ
I'm trying to get everybody to use it more effectively and would like opinions on the most useful features and their shortcuts so I can share more than just what I use it for.<#>NQ
So what's your single favorite feature and its keyboard shortcut for ReSharper?<#>Q
What is a good PHP/MySQL/AJAX poll system?<#>Q
Does anyone know of a good working polling system using PHP, Ajax, and MySQL to store the results?<#>Q
It does not need to have any advanced features, just the basic one vote per person feature.<#>NQ
Given the opportunity, which other scripting language would you use and why?<#>Q
Is this a good way to use controllers and views in CodeIgniter?<#>Q
What is the best way to use controllers/views in CodeIgniter?<#>Q
Is the following a bad way to go about making my pages?<#>Q
I'm quasi-templating this way, and it works fine for getting the outline of the site, but is it the best way to create an app?<#>Q
I've been working in CodeIgniter for about a week now, and I'm new to PHP.<#>NQ
Are you a self taught programmer or did you take a programming course?<#>Q
Lots of developers I know were self taught programmers including me. <#>NQ
I was wondering how much of the developer community learned programming by taking a course in school or by experimenting, asking questions on forums, reading online articles, and just making it up as you go along?<#>Q
Post whether you were self taught or took classes, what language you program in, and anything else that may be interesting.<#>Q
Books count as self taught.<#>NQ
Do you use "kibibyte" as a unit of measurement in your programs?<#>Q
For decades, in the field of computing (except disk manufacturers), a KB (kilobyte) was understood to mean 1024 bytes.<#>NQ
In the past few years, there has been a movement to use KiB ("kibibyte") to mean 1024 bytes, and change the meaning of kilobyte to be 1000 bytes, dooming us to many more years of confusion.<#>NQ
On the other hand, the movement seems to be confined to Gnome, and some overzealous wikipedia editing.<#>NQ
Will you be converting your programs to use KiB?<#>Q
If you have ever displayed a filesize in KB, did you divide by 1000 or 1024?<#>Q
Possible pitfalls of open-sourcing software<#>NQ
I'm asking this question because I'm not very well informed about some open-source issues, so I hope someone sheds some light on this matter.<#>NQ
How can one maintain his lead of software he made open-source.<#>Q
What rights one keeps?<#>Q
Don't I loose my word on direction software is taking after I open-source it?<#>Q
Any things to watch out? <#>Q
I'll be very grateful for every answer, thank you<#>NQ
LimeSurvey in .net version?<#>NQ
There is a famous poll or survey platform called LimeSurvey written in PHP.<#>NQ

I am trying to get a sense of what tools people are using for system modeling?<#>Q
Right now I use:<#>NQ
I have been looking for a good freeware data modeling tool that can rival Erwin, but haven't found anything yet.<#>NQ
I have always wondered if tools like Popkins System Architect are any good too.<#>NQ
What is stopping you from using static analysis tools?<#>Q
"Low [Machine] Level" Blogs<#>NQ
I am looking for Blogs that discuss low level programming like assembler, how a .dll loads, how to process links to a .dll, and how a loader maps DLLs into a Process Address Space, among other topics.<#>NQ
Links are appreciated.<#>NQ
Favourite Java Site<#>NQ
What is your favourite Java orientated website?<#>Q
Can be forum, news, podcast or any type of site as long as it is about the Java programming language.<#>NQ
All flavours of Java should be considered; SE, EE and ME.<#>NQ
What language(s) have you learned, and how?<#>Q
Currently I am in college to be a business app developer of sorts.<#>NQ
We're learning C#, and VB.NET almost exclusively right now.<#>NQ
This makes me think as to why we are.<#>NQ
I've read that C# is efficient with almost anything you could ever want to do with it, and that's great.<#>NQ
We tend to do a lot of those out of the book review projects, which gets tedious fast killing what ambition I might have had for the languages.<#>NQ
Again, I thought about how we learn the languages that we do and figured that it might be interesting to know how others have learned the languages they know.<#>NQ
My question though, is simply what languages have you learned and how did you learn them?<#>Q
What do you use the languages for(if you know more than one and use them quite often)? <#>Q
If you would be so kind, and if it is available post a link to some material that helped you learn it. <#>NQ
Best practices on answering dogfood excuses<#>NQ
Dogfooding is using your own software while it is being developed.<#>NQ
Sometimes it is impossible to simple use it at all (e.g.<#>NQ
software for fighter pilots.<#>NQ
)  More often it is possible to dogfood, but it doesn't happen anyway.  <#>NQ
A couple of "Our users won't experience that problem so it can't be a dogfooding bug," and quickly the practicalities of dogfooding go down so far no one does it.<#>NQ
What are the best practices about getting dogfooding to actually happen?<#>Q
What RFC should a web developer read and understand<#>Q
Lately, I found that most developer out there that does web programming does not fully understand the web standard and what's out there (me included).<#>NQ
Do any of you have a list of RFC that is essential for web programming (ex.<#>Q
http, xml, rest....)<#>NQ
Generic POC Application<#>NQ
When looking into new techniques, technologies or frameworks a company would test it through a process using a Proof of Concept (POC).<#>NQ
Does your company use a generic application which to apply the concept to, if so what is your application?<#>Q
examples are petshop, northwind, AdventureWorks, shop etc<#>NQ
Or does you company write a brand new POC domain for each concept?<#>Q
Pesonal Side note:<#>NQ
I would have thought the former would be of great advantage as you can just fork off a new branch to test a concept quickly, could you explain why your company thought it was good (or not) to have a generic app.<#>Q
To me a POC should be carried out to see if a concept will improve/fix something in your existing applications. <#>NQ
Having a smaller generic application (which represents the complexity and the way all your systems are built) so you can investigate the impact/pros/cons of a concept quickly.<#>NQ
As if you were to create POC each time that could take time, IE I want to test data access, I could just alter the test generic app, then note the required changes and impacts on this style of application.<#>NQ
Trac in a Scrum team : What are the best plugins / hacks?<#>Q
I want to setup a Trac server to support my developer team work along with Bitten as a Continuous Integration server.<#>NQ
We are using the Scrum development process.<#>NQ
What are the Trac's plugins, hacks, macros or configurations I could use to fit my team needs ?<#>Q
Should a web app use its own public API to display data?<#>Q
I'm starting to build a site that as most do, displays data in various ways from a database.<#>NQ
I'm building a public REST API as part of this project, and will be designing this in parallel with the main site, as I believe that it's an integral feature.<#>NQ
Should the site itself use the public API when retrieving data, or should it use a different method?<#>Q
It seems silly to duplicate code in this way, but I'm not sure if there will be a speed issue.<#>NQ
multiple polls with email submit function<#>NQ
I want to add a 4 sets of polls that each have around 4 radio buttons each for answers - then i would like to add an 'enter your email address' field below these polls.<#>NQ
Finally I would like the submit button after the email field to 'submit' the data from the polls and the email address entered - so only one submit button.<#>NQ
Just to make things even better, I would like some form of validation, that will not pass the form unless all 4 polls have a radio button pressed and a valid email.<#>NQ
All this is then to go into a MySQL database.<#>NQ
I have the email validation bit nailed - so thats fine.. it's the multiple polls bit thats getting me - I cannot get it to work?!<#>NQ
Do i have to effectively add 5 forms?<#>Q
Any help would be greatly appreciated.<#>NQ
Exceptional Project Management Moment<#>NQ
I am yet to see one of those "Exceptional Project Management" moments in my career as a developer.<#>NQ
I know there wont be one straight answer,but Here is my question:<#>NQ
How do you spot such a thing?<#>Q
(I worked in many projects where project managers were just monitoring the health of a project, more of status reporting kind of thing.Please share if you have experienced any great moment,where a project manager completely understood a development-issue,better if it is technical, and saved a project.<#>NQ
What are your Rails bookmarks to help you solve problems and learn?<#>Q
When you're solving a problem in Rails, what websites do you turn to as resources?<#>Q

I'm not looking for links to tools such as IDEs, but rather information resources. <#>NQ
One url per answer please to help voting.<#>NQ
Best practice to detect two simultaneous signals on two input pins<#>NQ
I need to do the following: I have 2 input pins on a microcontroller, and it is possible, that a signal is received on one or the other, but it is also possible that the two will be physically connected on the outside, and the signal arrives on both at the same time.<#>NQ
The problem: if I use something like <#>NQ
there is the one in a million chance, that the signal arrives between when the two values are loaded into the registers for the logical AND operation to be performed.<#>NQ
When I leave the if, both the pins are high, but I still detected that only the second one was high.<#>NQ
I tried out different solutions, and the best so far seems to be to start a very short countdown when either of the inputs is high, and when the timer (a few milliseconds at most) runs down, I check again.<#>NQ
Does anyone know a simpler or better solution?<#>Q
I thought this problem was very common, but I could not find any "tried and true" methods so far.<#>NQ
Edit: I know from the hardware, that after an edge the pin will hold its value for at least a few dozen milliseconds.<#>NQ
Noise is already been taken care of.<#>NQ
PINB.1 and PINB.2 were just examples.<#>NQ
They might possibly be on different ports, so bitmasking the whole port might have the risk of not being flexible enough.<#>NQ
What is the best criteria to say an application is ENTERPRISE?<#>Q
What is the best way to say an application is Enterprise?<#>Q
Is it because of being able to integrated with other applications, being able to use other "Enterprise" applications or ?<#>Q
Is Test Driven Development good for a starter?<#>Q
Expanding this question on how I learnt to pass from problem description to code  Two people mentioned TDD.<#>Q
Would it be good for a starter to get into TDD ( and avoid bad habits in the future ?<#>Q
) Or would it be too complex for a stage when understand what a programming language is?<#>Q
What are the best programming puzzles you came across?<#>Q
Every single programmer worth his salt is inspired by great programming puzzles.<#>NQ
Some puzzles are intended to sharpen your analytical abilities while some others make your programming abilities better.<#>NQ
Programming puzzles are the soul of infotainment in the programming community.<#>NQ
What are your favorite programming puzzles?<#>Q
For the validity of this question, you may want to check out:Posting programming/algorithmic puzzles on SO<#>NQ
MS SQL Server: Tutorials, blogs and other resources that you actually use or used in the past to improve your SQL Server skills<#>NQ

Should all public methods of an API be documented?<#>Q
When writing "library" type classes, is it better practice to always write markup documentation (i.e.<#>NQ
javadoc) in java or assume that the code can be "self-documenting"?<#>Q
For example, given the following method stub:<#>NQ
When writing "library" type classes, is it better practice to always write markup documentation (i.e.<#>Q
javadoc) in java or assume that the code can be "self-documenting"?<#>NQ
For example, given the following method stub:<#>NQ
The javadoc seems to be self-evident, and noise that just needs to be updated if the funcion is changed at all.<#>NQ
But the sentence about flushing and not closing the stream could be valuable.<#>NQ
So, when writing a library, is it best to:<#>NQ
a) always document<#>NQ
b) document anything that isn't obvious<#>NQ
c) never document (code should speak for itself!<#>NQ
I usually use b), myself (since the code can be self-documenting otherwise)...<#>NQ
Black hat knowledge for white hat programmers<#>NQ
There's always skepticism from non-programmers when honest developers learn the techniques of black hat hackers.<#>NQ
Obviously though, we need to learn many of their tricks so we can keep our own security up to par.<#>NQ
To what extent do you think an honest programmer needs to know the methods of malicious programmers?<#>Q
Essential Firefox Plugins/Extensions?<#>NQ
What firefox plugins could you not live without, as relates to webdev?<#>Q

Poll: what IDE/text editor do Drupal developers use?<#>Q
I always wanted to know what IDE or text editor do Drupal developers (core maintainers, third party developers, module developers) use.<#>NQ
Drupal has a huge (and growing) API, complex hooks and functions, so what IDE/text editor YOU the developer think is really helping you getting your job done?<#>Q
Recommend Test Case Manager<#>NQ
I'm looking for recommendations for a Test Case manager. <#>NQ
Desirable Features:<#>NQ
What group collaboration/information tools are useful?<#>Q
Being part of a company with hundreds (if not thousands) of developers arrayed over a wide range of projects, it can be very hard to get the information you need from the right person about a piece of software you are working on.<#>NQ
What kinds of tools (and practices) have you found useful for finding answers, knowledge transfer, documentation, collaboration, etc?<#>Q
Solutions that can be installed/maintained in-house are preferred so as to protect company IP.<#>NQ
Update: We use Perforce for our source control, and tool integration is a huge plus.<#>NQ
(For example, Code Collaborator is a new tool to our arsenal, and the ability to add a Perforce changelist directly to a code review is huge.<#>NQ
) At the end of the day though if a tool is simply brilliant whether or not it integrates with what we have in place already becomes a secondary priority.<#>NQ
Open source v. commercial isn't as big a deal as being able to host the services on our side of the firewall.<#>NQ
I was actually thinking something like SO for internal, IP-based queries could be a real benefit to the company-- tools like that where you really see their benefit with respect to delivering timely and accurate knowledge right where it needs to go.<#>NQ
We have our own bug-tracking system; I'm more interested in knowledge-transfer/documentation/communication tools and processes.<#>NQ
Deep-Initialising Java Bean properties<#>NQ
Do you bother initialising java bean values?<#>Q
Say, for example:<#>NQ
([g|s]etters omitted)<#>NQ
(Yes, this is a POJO being used as a bean rather than a Java Bean in the strictest sense)<#>NQ
In the empty constructor, do you initialise these members, or simply do nothing?<#>Q
Likewise, would Baz initialise it's members as well?<#>Q
Or do you just leave them as null?<#>Q
How can I use PHP and JavaScript to make an image clickable, and increment a counter stored as a flat file?<#>Q
Im trying to find a php/js script that will let me take an image, and when clicked, increase the number in a flat file, and save that file.<#>NQ
I know how to include the file to get the vote total.<#>NQ
Im going insane trying to find this to plug and play into my website.<#>NQ
Id love to have ip logging, and a cool fade in/out refresh update thing.<#>NQ
But at this point ill settle for basics.<#>NQ
Id like to avoid using MySQL, but if its necessary i can work with it.<#>NQ
CSS, HTML Web Browser tolerances<#>NQ
I just opened a webpage in safari and what did I saw?<#>Q
- The whole text was green?<#>NQ
But I only make the captions green, so the regular text should be black..?<#>NQ
I wondered.. then I thought.. Well I programmed this site in Firefox.<#>NQ
At first I thought it was a bad intepretation of the safari but I reviewed my code again and I saw this:<#>NQ
Umm.. oh well I haven't closed the h3 tag..<#>NQ
So the Safari interpretend my code right?<#>Q
And the Firefox tolerated this typo??<#>Q
Cause' in Firefox it works as it should: GREEN caption BLACK text.. Safari says: "No no!<#>NQ
You forgot to close the h3?<#>Q
Well now everything is green, deal with it.."<#>NQ
My Question is: How tolerant are the major browsers?<#>Q
What (typos, invalids, etc) do the browser tolerate?<#>Q
What is a good book for building Office 2007 solutions?<#>Q
I see some messing with Word and Excel files via add-ins or code-behinds in the near future.<#>NQ
Have no prior experience with programming Office solutions.. except a few random hacks... so would like a Getting Started / Cookbook type of book. <#>NQ
I've looked up the net and found a few.<#>NQ
Unfortunately reviews are rare on these books..<#>NQ
So in case you'd like to recommend any.. please <#>NQ
Citations of Modular Architecture of some well known organizations<#>NQ
I have a task at work to defend why we should go for a modular architecture (i.e.<#>Q
taking out a vertical slice from our main app, and putting it into its own module).<#>NQ
I was asked how companies like facebook, linkedin, or some other well known organizations does it.<#>NQ
Like do they have a module for the wall, for the profile, for the connections, etc?<#>Q
..And if so, are these modules deployed as separate applications unto their own containers and communicate to other applications over the network (i.e.<#>Q
Anybody knows of some citations on how some well known organizations does their modular architecture and what goes to its own module and what goes to the core application (i.e.<#>Q
Facebook-core, or Linkedin-core, etc)<#>NQ

Adding REST to Django -- Poll<#>NQ
I've got a Django application that works nicely.<#>NQ
I'm adding REST services.<#>NQ
I'm looking for some additional input on my REST strategy.  <#>NQ
Here are some examples of things I'm wringing my hands over.<#>NQ
Please nominate one approach per answer so we can vote them up or down.<#>NQ
What is your favorite (insert language here) conference?<#>Q
I am curious to know what people consider the best conference to go to for each realm of development languages.<#>NQ
For instance, in the .NET world, there is DevConnections and Alt.NET.<#>NQ
The DevConnections conferences are pretty good, but I learn so much more from Alt.NET and Continuous Improvement conferences.<#>NQ
Why do you like Python?<#>Q
I have to make a presentation at work to convince everyone why they should try coding in Python.<#>NQ
So, I thought of taking a poll here...<#>NQ
What is it about Python (features, etc) over other languages that you love?<#>Q
The reason I usually give is that in Python you forget about the complexities and frills of programming languages and can just focus on producing code that works... What do you think?<#>Q
C# Delegates - How Often Do You Use Them, And When?<#>Q
Delegates look like such a powerful language feature, but I've yet to find an opportunity to use them in anger (apart from in DALs I must say).<#>NQ

Survey component that can be embeded locally<#>NQ
I'm working with PHP and need to add a survey component.<#>NQ
I would prefer something that allows me to embed the survey on the site.<#>NQ
The creation of the survey itself can be off-site, no problem there, as long as the users themselves don't have to go elsewhere to answer the survey.<#>NQ
Does something like this already exist?<#>Q
There's another issue: some of the surveys may be closed surveys i.e.<#>NQ
sent to a specific group of emails and only those can answer it.<#>NQ
So I'm guessing the user will have to click a link which has his email and code coded as parameters.<#>NQ
Any other ways to do the same thing that I may be missing? <#>Q
I'm open to all suggestions... but would really prefer not to have to install an entire open source system for this, unless all else fails.<#>NQ
Problem with polling sockets in python<#>NQ
How can I create a user rating system?<#>Q
I have a page users/index that contains all users and users/view/id/5 that shows info for user #5.<#>NQ
I want to make some kind of rating for users.<#>NQ
That means that a user can click something like user/rulez/id/5 and give a vote to user #5 and that must be redirected to page user/index or user/view/id/5, depending on the place he voted.<#>NQ
I've read about _helper-&gt;redirector, but I still can't think of a method that could take me to the required page.<#>NQ
What features would you like to see in the win32 Delphi Compiler?<#>Q
Delphi (the language) has its own syntax and features, and other languages have their own too.<#>NQ
As a Delphi developer, what would you like to have in the win32 Delphi compiler?<#>Q
And if you are not a Delphi developer, what features would make you starting using Delphi?<#>Q
Here's my short list<#>NQ
Main Features:<#>NQ
I'm sure many have their own list, so let's start dreaming ;-)<#>NQ
Any Real-Life Visual Source Safe Horror Stories<#>NQ
VSS is much maligned and perhaps justifiably so.<#>NQ
Please don't confuse me as an apologist for it, as I gave up on it a while back in favor of Vault. <#>NQ
However, despite using VSS for over 10 years on numerous projects with development teams between 3 and 10 developers, I never experienced (or to be fair, noticed) any data loss.<#>NQ
I will admit it frequently reported corruption and needed repair, and was extremely slow over WAN connections, but I don't recall a single instance where I couldn't get something back that I needed in all that time.<#>NQ
Ultimately I switched for performance reasons, lack of features, and general uneasiness about how often it asked me to run the repair utility.<#>NQ
Given the considerable sentiment that it is a source code destruction system, I was just curious to hear some first hand accounts of data loss and the circumstances surrounding them (i.e.<#>NQ
Team size, Remote connections, project size) and the outcome (total data loss, partial data loss, were network backups sufficient to get it back?<#>Q
I am not looking for comparisons of it against other SCM systems, I am just trying to get a feel for how much of the tarnish on VSS is from first hand experience rather than legend.<#>NQ
Which LINQ syntax do you prefer?<#>Q
Fluent or Query Expression<#>NQ
LINQ is one of the greatest improvements to .NET since generics and it saves me tons of time, and lines of code.<#>NQ
However, the fluent syntax seems to come much more natural to me than the query expression syntax.<#>NQ
Which do you prefer and if you write standards for your company, do you enforce one over the other?<#>Q
Database schema normalization checker?<#>Q
I'm interested in learning about tools that operate like this:<#>NQ
Given a database schema and some data, suggest whether the schema is likely structured in any particular normal form, and then tell how the schema might be factored to produce further normalization.<#>NQ
Basically, a static analysis tool for database schema design.<#>NQ
Like other static analysis tools, such a database tool need not generate perfect results (I doubt such a "perfect" tool is computationally feasible), or applicable to all database systems, or free/open source, or anything else.<#>NQ
The tool need not be stand-alone; it could be bundled as some sophisticated IDE feature.<#>NQ
I'm just wondering what's out there.<#>NQ
Source Control on the IBM i (iSeries)<#>NQ
On the web side we are working on getting source control.<#>NQ
Now, I want to see what can be done for the iSeries side.<#>NQ
What is your favorite source control application for iSeries and why?<#>Q
I am looking for low-cost if possible.<#>NQ
Project based on J2EE<#>NQ
Would you start J2EE project nowadays if you have other alternatives?<#>Q
UPDATE: I think little clarification is needed: Is it worth investing in J2EE if practically everything it claims to offer can be achieved by using other technologies?<#>Q
To be honest, J2EE scares me by its monstrosity and I foresee substantial maintenance and/or evolution costs.<#>NQ
What is the most dangerous feature in Java?<#>Q
Which feature of the Java-language is the source of the most misunderstandings and bugs in your experience?<#>Q
The scope of this question is about the language, not the class-library.<#>NQ
Are modal dialogs a good practice for the web?<#>Q
Are modal windows/dialogs considered a good practice for websites?<#>Q
One of the things that concerns me about using a modal window is that it is so much like a pop-up window and it could cause user frustration or cause users to simply close it because it's intrusive.<#>NQ
Do you know of any studies that talk about user preferences and use rates? <#>Q
Are there any accessibility issues beyond having the a modal window link load the content in a new page when JavaScript is turned off?<#>Q
Do you like sites or web apps that use modal windows?<#>Q
Why or why not?<#>Q
What are good and bad practices for implementing modal windows?<#>Q
I know modals are probably most often used when displaying pictures or galleries, but what are some other practical use cases?<#>Q
Do you use them on your site and what lead you to your decision? <#>Q
How often should you hit the Save button?<#>Q
When writing code, I've noticed that different developers hit the Save button at different frequencies.<#>NQ
This is in addition to whatever AutoSave setting has been set.<#>NQ
Personally I have the AutoSave set to 10 minutes, and I hit the Save button whenever I type a reasonable amount of code (perhaps 10 to 30 lines).<#>NQ
How about you guys?<#>Q
Best Open Source Project Hosting Site<#>NQ
I want to start an open source project, but the rise in hosting sites leaves me a little paralyzed with choice.<#>NQ

Any recommendations?<#>Q
What output and recording ports does the Java Sound API find on your computer?<#>Q
I'm working with the Java Sound API, and it turns out if I want to adjust recording volumes I need to model the hardware that the OS exposes to Java.<#>NQ
Turns out there's a lot of variety in what's presented. <#>NQ
Because of this I'm humbly asking that anyone able to help me run the following on their computer and post back the results so that I can get an idea of what's out there. <#>NQ
A thanks in advance to anyone that can assist :-)<#>NQ
All the application does is print out a line about the OS, a line about the JVM, and a few lines about the hardware found that may pertain to recording hardware.<#>NQ
For example on my PC at work I get the following:<#>NQ
OS: Windows XP 5.1/x86<#>NQ
Java: 1.6.0_07 (Sun Microsystems Inc.)<#>NQ

What IDE to use for Python?<#>Q
Asking as a Python beginner, what IDEs ("GUIs/editors") do others use for Python coding?<#>Q
If you can just give the name (for example, Textpad, Eclipse ..) that will be enough.<#>NQ
If it is already mentioned, you can just vote for it.<#>NQ
But if you can also give some more comparative information, that will be much appreciated.<#>NQ
Update: Results so far<#>NQ
Acronyms used: <#>NQ
I don't mention basics like syntax highlighting as I expect these by default.<#>NQ
This is a just dry list reflecting your feedback and comments, I am not advocating any of these tools.<#>NQ
I will keep updating this list as you keep posting your answers.<#>NQ
Can you help me to add features of the above editors to the list (like auto-complete, debugging, etc.<#>Q

We're considering moving our documentation to a wiki.<#>NQ
I tried the SharePoint wiki but it seems really poor on features.<#>NQ
Then I tried Mediawiki, but we don't have PHP/MySQL available in our network.<#>NQ
We work a lot with Microsoft technology and I was wondering what is the best Wiki that you used that is written in ASP.NET using MSSQL?<#>Q
Can you use a object-database in a production system?<#>Q
Object-databases are used very seldomly, albeit they offer a way to live without SQL, which is, I think, a benefit of its own. <#>NQ
Yet, I have seen them about never in production systems.<#>NQ
Is there something fundamentally wrong with object-databases?<#>Q
Can I use a object-database in a production system?<#>Q
Edit: So, maybe I should confess that I love object-databases.<#>NQ
I cannot really get my head around why they are not used a lot more often. <#>NQ
How to prevent the most number of cheaters for polls?<#>Q
On my website we run a contest system and users vote for other user's content.<#>NQ
We recently caught someone creating multiple accounts to vote multiple times (consecutive id numbers, and votes within a couple minutes).<#>NQ
We would like to prevent that from happening again.<#>NQ
Judging how Times handled their "Most Influential Person of the Century" poll, even the big guys get it wrong.<#>NQ
Currently we log User ID's, vote date, and IPv4 addresses (via $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']).<#>NQ
What things can I do to prevent or make it more difficult for someone to vote fraudulently?<#>Q
C++ RTTI Viable Examples<#>NQ
I am familiar with C++ RTTI, and find the concept interesting.<#>NQ
Still there exist a lot of more ways to abuse it than to use it correctly (the RTTI-switch dread comes to mind).<#>NQ
As a developer, I found (and used) only two viable uses for it (more exactly, one and a half).<#>NQ
Could you share some of the ways RTTI is a viable solution to a problem, with example code/pseudo-code included?<#>Q
Note: The aim is to have a repository of viable examples a junior developer can consult, criticize and learn from.<#>NQ
Edit: You'll find below code using C++ RTTI<#>NQ

How to make sure a user can only vote once on an ASP.NET poll<#>Q
I'm trying to make a ASP.NET (C#) poll that will ask a user a Yes/No question and log that vote to the database.<#>NQ
To prevent spam I would like to be able to make sure users can only vote once.<#>NQ
I've thought about logging the users IP address.<#>NQ
If this is the answer can someone give me a tutorial that shows how this can be accomplished.<#>Q
If this is not the answer then give me your suggestions. <#>NQ
Edit: I'm not asking users to register as this is not my website.<#>NQ
Best unit test tutorials for beginners<#>NQ
Most decent programmers know that unit testing is important, but may not know where to begin.<#>NQ
For a long time I knew the benefits of unit testing, but could never seem to figure out where a good starting point was.<#>NQ
Most articles I read on the subject dealt with the high level theoretical, rather than the down-and-dirty practical.<#>NQ
I've noticed that recently, some articles are appearing that create an application and then walk through where, and why, unit tests are applied to it.<#>NQ
These articles still haven't fully risen to the surface yet; after all, the theoretical articles are good, but they may not be the best thing to start with when trying to learn a new concept.<#>NQ
What I want to know is, what is the bestpracticalunit testing article or tutorial you know of?<#>Q
(language doesn't matter)<#>NQ
EDIT: I'm actually interested in amassing a list of tutorials, not complete books.<#>NQ
How can I integrate a poll module into a Grails application?<#>Q
In my Grails application, I would like to integrate a simple poll module through which people can vote (without authentication), with different options, integrated into the homepage of my website.<#>NQ
Poll Results (preferably graphical) can be shown in a different page (or in the same module frame).<#>NQ
Is there a Grails plugin or any other simple way to integrate such a feature in my website?<#>Q
What are some guidelines for creating a poll module?<#>Q
I want to implement a poll in my website, and it's a publicly available website, so anyone can vote.<#>NQ
What is the best option for creating a poll?<#>Q
In my opinion there is only cookies in which I can store information and check if this user has already voted.<#>NQ
My website is multi-lingual and I'm using ASP.NET-MVC 2.<#>NQ
WSGI Middleware recommendations<#>NQ
I have heard that there is lots of interesting and useful WSGI middleware around.<#>NQ

Developing during the weekend?<#>NQ
Do you allocate some hours during the weekend to code?<#>Q
If so, are you developing for self-improving, personal side projects, for the community (i.e.<#>Q
Open Source projects) or just because you can't stop doing it?<#>NQ
GCC on HP-UX, lots of poll(), pipe(), and file issues<#>NQ
I'm having a lot of trouble building a 'middleman' logger - the intention is to place it on the path above an item in /usr/bin and capture everything going to and from the application.<#>NQ
(Black box 3rd-party app is failing FTP for some reason.<#>NQ
)  Once run, the middleman will fork, redirect stdout and stdin to/from pipes that the parent has control of, and then execute the program in /usr/bin.<#>NQ
(Hardcoded; yes, I know, I'm bad.<#>NQ
However, once I run poll(), things get weird.<#>NQ
I lose the handle to my logfile, the poll on the output pipe from the child throws an error, cats and dogs start living together, et cetera.<#>NQ
Can anyone shed some light on this?<#>Q
Here's what I currently have...<#>NQ
The poll() in question is marked with non-indented comments for ease of location.<#>NQ
After the fixes, I have attempted to run 'banner' through this program, and here's the output I get...<#>NQ
The logfile has the following:<#>NQ
The reason ERRNO has a 0 in it is because poll() returns just fine; it's the pollArray[1].revents that came back with an error, which means childOutPipe[0] polled as having an error.<#>NQ
logChar(), as far as I can tell, never gets called.<#>NQ
I'm going to try splitting out poll() into two different calls.<#>NQ
Okay, the moment I poll() - even on stdin, which doesn't return with an error message - it kills my ability to write to the logFile.<#>NQ
Also, I discovered that the while() loop runs several times before the output poll comes back with an error on the pipe.<#>NQ
I'm becoming increasingly convinced that poll() is simply a lost cause.<#>NQ
Every attempt to write to logFile fails after the poll(), even a successful poll(), with errno set to "Bad file number".<#>NQ
This really should not be happening.<#>NQ
I honestly cannot see how it would be affecting my file handle.<#>NQ
Okay, so apparently I'm a moron.<#>NQ
Thanks for setting me straight; I was assuming nfds was a byte size, not an array size.<#>NQ
That's fixed, and voila!<#>NQ
It's not killing my logFile handle any more.<#>NQ
What time of day are you most proficient at programming?<#>Q
For some reason I find that I am at my best, in terms of programming, late at night.<#>NQ
I'm not sure if it's because I lose my inhibition that keeps me from pushing forward or if there is something else to it but either way I get the most done after the sun goes down.<#>NQ
What time of day do you find yourself the most proficient in terms of programming?<#>Q

Have You Ever Worked On Code Older Than You Are?<#>Q
Has anyone ever had the experience of maintaining code that was initially written on or before the date you were born?<#>Q
Personally the oldest code I ever worked on was first written in 1982, so it did not predate me.<#>NQ
One of my best friends is a mainframe developer and he worked on code first written in the early 70s, but it did not predate him (it was close though).<#>NQ
Is there a 'catch' with FastFormat?<#>Q
I just read about the FastFormat C++ i/o formatting library, and it seems too good to be true: Faster even than printf, typesafe, and with what I consider a pleasing interface:<#>NQ
This looks almost too good to be true.<#>NQ
Is there a catch?<#>Q
Have you had good, bad or indifferent experiences with it?<#>Q
CW on this question, as there's probably no right answer...<#>NQ
What is the most efficient Java Collections library?<#>Q
A few years ago, I did a lot of Java and had the impression back then that trove is the best (most efficient) Java Collections implementation.<#>NQ
But when I read the answers to the question "Most useful free Java libraries?<#>NQ
" I noticed that trove is hardly mentioned.<#>NQ
So which Java Collections library is best now? <#>Q
UPDATE: To clarify, I mostly want to know what library to use when I have to store millions of entries in a hash table etc.<#>NQ
(need a small runtime and memory footprint).<#>NQ

Straw Poll - K&R; vs BSD<#>NQ
No holy wars please - (ultimately a standardised and consistently-observed house-style on a project always wins out whatever is chosen), but I am genuinely interested in the preferences of people for K&amp;R style formatting:<#>NQ
over BSD style:<#>NQ
K&amp;R seems to be making a bit of a comeback recently (I'm an old programmer, so I've seen these things fluctuate); do people think K&amp;R looks more professional, more cool, more readable, is compactness when viewing more important than extending the structure down the screen?<#>Q
Please use the 2 community wiki answers below to vote for K&amp;R vs. BSD.<#>NQ
Polls shouldn't earn rep for the first person that manages to type "BSD FTW!<#>NQ
This question is nearly 2 years old and people are still down-voting it; ENOUGH!<#>NQ
Weaknesses of Hibernate<#>NQ
I would like to know which are the weak points of Hibernate 3.<#>NQ
This is not pretended to be a thread against Hibernate.<#>NQ
I think it will be a very useful knowledge for decide if Hibernate is the best option for a project or for estimating its time.<#>NQ
A weakness can be:<#>NQ
Also, can be useful to know some solutions for that problems, better ORM or techniques, or it will be corrected in Hibernate 4.<#>NQ
For example, AFAIK, Hibernate will have a very bad performance updating 10000 rows comparing to JDBC in this query:<#>NQ
What's the single most important piece of documentation?<#>Q
You are joining a project to maintain an existing system.<#>NQ
There is no written documentation at all, but the previous team offers to write one piece of documentation.<#>NQ
And they are going to let you decide what it should cover: What is the single most important piece of documentation?<#>Q
This is a poll: give only one document type per answer and let other readers vote.<#>NQ
When is it acceptable to use jQuery?<#>Q
I have recently been thinking alot about where to draw the line, and I wanted to get some answers from you experienced developers out there.<#>NQ
When is it acceptable to reference jQuery in a web app?<#>Q
Some supporting arguments for Always Using jQuery:<#>NQ
Some supporting arguments for Never Using jQuery:<#>NQ
I listed arguments as part of the question because I do not wish to have answers weighing the arguments of both sides.<#>NQ
I am hoping for always/never answers, preferrably with test case scenarios (vague or detailed).<#>NQ
For example: "If I ever need to do any AJAX requests in my web app, I always use jQuery".<#>NQ
Drupal voting module with an image per option<#>NQ
I've searched for a while and can't find this option.<#>NQ
In Drupal 6.15 I'm trying to setup a Poll that will allow me to upload an image for each option to vote on, and have the image inline with the radio button.<#>NQ
Also I'd like to have a text field for each option to describe the image.<#>NQ

Source Code Analysis - what do you do?<#>Q
Situation: I have some source code, and I'm boning up on what happens.<#>NQ
Who calls what, what goes where, etc, etc.<#>Q
(There is minimal documentation/comments, so I have to work it out myself).<#>NQ
Now, my usual solution is to fire up a splitscreen text editor and stare at the code until I understand it, or maybe print it and write all over it with colored pens.<#>NQ
This is a horribly slow and inefficient way to go about it, I think. <#>NQ
What do you do/what tools do you use in these situations? <#>Q
What are the most useful shortcuts for performing back-of-the-envelope calculations of computing problems?<#>Q
With a back-of-the-envelope calculation you can mentally obtain an answer to a question, within an order of magnitude of its actual value.<#>NQ
Some shortcuts can simplify these calculations.<#>NQ
In computing I've found the rule <#>NQ
103n is-close-to 210n<#>NQ
invaluable.<#>NQ
For instance, through this I can say that I can binary search through a billion records with about 30 operations.<#>NQ
What other shortcuts do you use and recommend?<#>Q
Let's put them all here and vote your favorites.<#>NQ
Strategies for finding Heisenbugs<#>NQ
Currently I am once again in the situation that I have to find the cause for a Bug that almost never happens when a debugger is running (probably some race condition).<#>NQ
The only things I can think of to find it are:<#>NQ
All in all this is very frustrating.<#>NQ
What are your strategies and experiences with these kinds of bugs?<#>Q
Edit: I am using Visual C++ 2005, but I think the question applies many (all) languages and development environments.<#>NQ
What sort of mathematics do you use in your .Net app?<#>Q
Excluding everything that's in System.Math.<#>NQ
I think that System.Math is woefully inadequate.<#>NQ
For example, in several official .Net frameworks, I can count 3 different implementations of matrices.<#>NQ
Same goes for vectors.<#>NQ
One implementation of a complex number; several different implementations of arbitrary rational numbers, and so on.<#>NQ
So, what would you like to see in a hypothetical System.Mathematics namespace?<#>Q
Best JSON library to use when developing an iPhone application?<#>Q

What are the appropriate uses for MS Access?<#>Q
It's the Office app everyone loves to hate ;)<#>NQ
I admit that it's often abused or misused, but it does come in handy on occasion.<#>NQ

What do you use for web development and why you think it rocks?<#>Q
Here's my new project: an open canvas, right in front of me.<#>NQ
In a few days, I will start to code a big web application.<#>NQ
It will start small, with few modules, only myself as developer and engineer, but hopefully it will grow and grow.<#>NQ
Even though I am an active Java Developer, It's been a while since I last created a Web Application from scratch.<#>NQ
At the time, Struts and J2EE was the way to go, but I see a lot of new frameworks, new libraries raising everyday. <#>NQ
What I ask here is for your advice: what do you currently use for web development, why do you think it's relevant and if you would choose the same tools if you were starting on a new project.<#>Q
Everything counts: from tips on the UI to the backend.<#>NQ
Common gotchas, patterns, everything you can think may be relevant.<#>NQ
I am a Java developer and, I am naturally inclined to do everything using Java-related technologies (J2SE, J2EE, Groovy, Grails, JRuby, Jython, JWhatever, and so on...), but please be welcome to post whatever you use, being related to Java or not.<#>NQ
My goal here is to build a bucket of what people are doing and why they are doing to help me evaluate which way should I go, and which I shouldn't - and why.<#>NQ
After all, it's not everyday that you have such freedom to decide.<#>NQ
Thanks in advance!<#>NQ
How to get "under the hood" information of technologies / Programming languages?<#>Q
Usually, I will start learning how to use a technology/language like a web development framework from books.<#>NQ
When I acquire intermediate knowledge in the technology I start thinking of "How did they implement this or that?<#>Q
" I mean "under the hood" knowledge.<#>NQ
Sometimes it seems that some knowledge is available for privileged people.<#>NQ
So, my question, how do you get such information (advanced stuff)?<#>Q
Is there a secret to it?<#>Q
By the way, I have about  1.5 years of experience only.<#>NQ
Django app with selectable field types from admin panel?<#>Q
Looking for some implementation ideas here.<#>NQ
I am trying to design a custom polling system for my school, to allow teachers to give students polls to take.<#>NQ
I have a Poll model, Question model (with a foreignkey to Poll model), and Choice model (with a foreignkey to the Question model).<#>NQ
What I need to be able to do is allow whoever is adding questions to choose the type of choices that will be shown.<#>NQ
For example, one question should be able to be multiple choice (displayed via a radio buttons), and another question should be able to be "Check all that apply.<#>NQ
What is the best way to allow the creator of the poll to determine how the choices are shown?<#>Q
Should I do a CharField() with choices, and deal with it manually in the view?<#>Q
That doesn't seem efficient.<#>NQ
Ways to polling server status<#>NQ
I am try to create a JSP page that will show all the status in a group of local servers.<#>NQ
Currently I create a schedule class that will constantly poll to check the status of the server with 30 second interval, with 5 second delay to wait for each server reply, and provide the JSP page with the information.<#>NQ
However I find this way to be not accurate as it will take some time before the information of the schedule class to be updated.<#>NQ
Do you guys have a better way to check the status of several server within a local network?<#>Q
Thanks @Romain Hippeau and @dbyrne for their answers<#>NQ
Currently I am trying to make the code more in server end, that is to do a constant check<#>NQ
on the status of the group of server asynchronously for update so as to make it more responsive.<#>NQ
However I forgot to add that the client have the ability to control the server status.<#>NQ
Thus I have problem for example when the client changes the server status, and then refresh the page.<#>NQ
When the page retrieve the information from not updated schedule class, it will show the previous status of the server instead. <#>NQ
Secure file transfers<#>NQ
We are using a custom FTP application (which encrypts the files) for secure transfers.<#>NQ
We send the application to end users and they use it to send us confidential data.<#>NQ
We also use it to send information back to the end users.<#>NQ
The application is in need of an update - some things are no longer working consistently.<#>NQ
As the end users get more restrictive security environments, as OS updates are released, etc.<#>NQ
We have several options:<#>NQ
Some of features which would be nice:<#>NQ
Suggestions/comments?<#>Q
What is the next big bug that will hit us all (à la Y2K bug)?<#>Q
You and probably all of your non programmer relatives know about the Y2K bug.<#>NQ
I learned about the year 2038 bug a couple of months ago.<#>NQ
Hopefully by 2038 all OS and systems will be updated...<#>NQ
I was wondering is there others flaws like these in the field today that will hit us all?<#>Q
What java web application framework to use?<#>Q
One of the main products of my company is an Oracle Forms (and Reports) based application, that "needs" to be re-written in another technology.<#>NQ
Users want a more rich interface experience, and we want, preferably, to reduce costs with an open source application server.<#>NQ
For this (HUGE) project, we intend to use a java web application framework, keep these points in mind:<#>NQ

When should BOOL and bool be used in C++?<#>Q
When should BOOL and bool be used in C++ and why?<#>Q
I think using bool is cleaner and more portable because it's a built-in type.<#>NQ
But BOOL is unavoidable when you interactive with legacy code/C code, or doing inter-op from .NET with C code/Windows API.<#>NQ
So my policy is:<#>NQ
Use bool inside C++.<#>NQ
Use BOOL when talk to outer world, e.g., export function in windows DLL.<#>NQ
Is there a definitive explanation of when to use one over the other?<#>Q
Are there any really simple and usable issue tracking systems?<#>Q
Looking for an uber-simple issue/bug tracking system, as simple as possible.<#>NQ
It's just going to be for me to keep track of freelance web development projects.<#>NQ
Everything I've found has way too much (milestones, ability to assign to different users, severity levels, calendars, wikis, etc.<#>NQ
), and I can't seem to find anything stripped down.<#>NQ
Self-hosted or not, doesn't matter.<#>NQ
Anything you guys can recommend?<#>Q
What are the pitfalls and/or gotchas of continuous deployment<#>Q
I think I understand the benefits of continuous deployment.<#>NQ

Or what types of of problems or difficulties were encountered when starting out from scratch?<#>Q
For any problems with the process what was done to make it work?<#>Q
Do you recommend using semicolons after every statement in JavaScript?<#>Q
In many situations, JavaScript parsers will insert semicolons for you if you leave them out.<#>NQ
My question is, do you leave them out?<#>Q
I'll post simple Yes/No answers as a poll, but I'm also interested in your reasons.<#>NQ
If you're unfamiliar with the rules, there's a description of semicolon insertion on the Mozilla site.<#>NQ
Here's the key point:<#>NQ
That description may be incomplete, because it doesn't explain @Dreas's example.<#>NQ
Anybody have a link to the complete rules, or see why the example gets a semicolon?<#>Q
(I tried it in JScript.NET.<#>NQ
This stackoverflow question is related, but only talks about a specific scenario.<#>NQ
What .NET language you use to write Unit Tests?<#>Q
In the past I wrote most of my unit tests using C# even when the actual software development was in another .NET language (VB.NET, C++.NET etc.<#>NQ
) but I could use VB to get the same results.<#>NQ
I guess the only reason I use C# is because most of the examples in the internet are written in C#.<#>NQ
I you use unit tests as part of .NET software development what language do you prefer to use and what is the reason you choose to use it?<#>Q
I know that it depend greatly on the language of the proect under test but what I'm interested in finding out is whether there is a preference of a specific language to use while unit testing.<#>NQ
CS Majors: Hardest concept(s) you learned in school?<#>Q
For the CS majors out there what were the hardest CS classes or concepts that you learned in your undergraduate schooling?<#>Q
Did you find once you learned the basics,(data structs, OOP fundamentals, discrete math, pointers, recursion, etc) the rest followed naturally or did you hit a wall at any point in your higher classes like OS'es and Compilers?<#>Q
Thanks for the input!<#>NQ

Will you use Delphi Prism<#>Q
CodeGear announces that their Next .Net product which is known as Delphi Prism Will be RemObjects's Oxygene.<#>NQ
Oxygene has many nice features that not found in Delphi or C#, and I think it will be a more effective solution for .Net than Delphi .Net previous releases, but it's uses Visual Studio IDE instead of Delphi IDE.<#>NQ
which has some cons and pros.<#>NQ
As Delphi Developer or .Net Developer, do you consider to use Delphi Prism for .Net developmenet?<#>Q

I have been preparing for the interviews where I see lot of questions which are solved with bit tricks/manipulations/shift<#>NQ
Few examples are<#>NQ
There are also places where XOR is very useful.<#>NQ
when is XOR useful?<#>Q
I want to learn how can we apply such tricks in problem solving and what are the good signs when looking at the problem itself, one must say "it could be done with bits"<#>NQ
I worked mostly on Java/Python/Perl and hardly practiced them while writing code<#>NQ
But I want to learn it now .. better late than never :)<#>NQ
Most important things about C# generics... lesson learned<#>NQ
What are most important things you know about generics: hidden features, common mistakes, best and most useful practices, tips...<#>Q
I am starting to implement most of my library/API using generics and would like to collect most common patterns, tips, etc., found in practice.<#>NQ
Let me formalize the question: What is the most important thing you've learned about generics?<#>Q
Please try to provide examples -- it would be easier to understand, as opposed to convoluted and overly-dry descriptions<#>NQ
This question is somewhat similar to Jon's question, though, on a different subject.<#>NQ
What is the best way for a non-CS major to obtain credibility as a programmer?<#>Q
I did not study CS in college and have been working with a company for almost five years.<#>NQ
During this time I have worked closely with our development team, and have realized I enjoy software development work and coding.<#>NQ
For about three years, I have profusely studied from books: mostly programming languages (C#, Python, and Java) and SQL, but as time and money allow I plan to work into SICP and eventually Knuth.  <#>NQ
I have recently joined the company's development team and want to do my best to obtain their respect, which I feel is lacking, since I come from a non-development background.<#>NQ
How can I do this most effectively?<#>Q

What would you like to see in a TDD demo?<#>Q
I am going to be giving a presentation on TDD and I always struggle with what to put in the demo when giving this presentation.<#>NQ
I usually only have about an hour to do the actual coding portion of the demo so it can't be too extravagant.<#>NQ
However, using a "classic" example (stack,queue) is a bit simplistic for most developers.<#>NQ
It leaves them feeling as though this won't work in a real world solution.<#>NQ
There are a lot of concepts one needs to make TDD work well on their project besides understanding the core testing cycle (Test, Code, Refactor).<#>NQ
So the question is...<#>NQ
As a developer what kind of real world example would you like to see that incorporates these aspects and:<#>Q
What tools do you use in your build process to guarantee better code quality?<#>Q
Earlier today I asked a question about enforcing coding standards.<#>NQ
Someone mention about NDepend tool that does code analysis.<#>NQ
It looks like this tools does a lot of good thing to help developers to write higher quality code.<#>NQ
The problem is that NDepend is not free (I obviously got spoiled by Open Source projects).<#>NQ
I don't mind to spend money if this tool will help my team to produce higher quality code.<#>NQ
Here comes my question.<#>NQ
Actually I have two questions:<#>NQ
I understand that the best way to guarantee code quality is code reviews.<#>NQ
And I don't expect a tool to replace code review.<#>NQ
automated system testing approaches for combination of PC + embedded SW<#>NQ
The system consists of a hardware device and a PC.<#>NQ
The PC runs a GUI that controls the hardware device.<#>NQ
To test the device various test hardware is used that can be controlled by RS232 or GPIB.<#>NQ
To automate this testing the test software would have to control the test hardware and interact with the PC GUI.<#>NQ
What is the best way you know of to automate the testing of this system? <#>Q
There are lots of ways to test a system like this.<#>NQ
The tests can be controlled by COTS test software or by a custom test software built in house.<#>NQ
Possibly a combination of COTS packages would be the best approach - one that specializes in GUI testing and one for the device.<#>NQ
I've seen Labview applied to testing devices - not sure if it can do GUIs too.<#>NQ
Maybe leaving off the GUI layer of the Windows app and exposing an automation layer is the best approach.<#>NQ
What do you think?<#>Q
What have you tried?<#>Q
Voting up the better techniques should be very interesting.<#>NQ
"the best way" would have to take into account things like: most effective, maintainability, implementation time, cost, etc.<#>NQ
What is the first/last week of a month?<#>Q
If someone were to say something happens in the first or last week of some month, how would you define that span?<#>Q
Background<#>NQ
I'm working on a library that needs to handle this kind of thing in an intuitive way, but my intuition doesn't claim one case or the other.<#>NQ
I can make it select different behavior but still need a good default.<#>NQ
For a concrete example I'll just to pick an random month: July 2008<#>NQ
(Note: I'll assume the week starts with Sunday but the question could be asked re Monday as well)<#>NQ
What span is the first week of the month?<#>Q
The second week is just the 7 days following the first right?<#>NQ
What span is the last week of the month?<#>Q
Non wiki comments welcome<#>NQ
Most useful Rails plugins, Ruby libraries and Ruby gems?<#>Q
I have seen many sites which provide the whole list of Rails plugins, Ruby libraries and Ruby gems, but we hardly use few of them and some may not suit our requirement and we spend a whole lot of time searching for useful plugins which suits our requirement.<#>NQ
I have created this poll, people can post useful libraries, gems and plugins which they have come across.<#>NQ
It would be great help for newbies like me and to the entire Ruby on Rails community.<#>NQ
Note: to keep this poll as useful as possible, please remember:<#>NQ
Edit:  Any new plugins/Gems for Rails 3 ?<#>Q
Programming Contests (with prizes)<#>NQ
I've had a go at solving the Eternity puzzle (1,000,000 GBP prize) and Netflix Prize ($1,000,000) in the past.<#>NQ
I didn't win either, but they motivated me to find out about a new area. <#>NQ
What other contests with prizes do you know about / have competed in yourself?<#>Q
The single most useful Emacs feature<#>NQ
My primary editor is Emacs, but my usage habits and knowledge of features has barely changed over the last few years.  <#>NQ
What are the Emacs features that you use on a daily basis?<#>Q
Are there any little-known Emacs features that you find very useful?<#>Q
Edit: Made this into the recommended poll format...please put one feature per answer from now on.<#>NQ
What's the best programming language for code examples?<#>Q
What programming language do you prefer for code examples?<#>Q
I want to provide clarity to the most people possible when asking a question (while only using one language).<#>NQ
While a specific language may provide clarity (for people who know it), it may not be clear to the largest audience.<#>NQ
Edit: Another consideration, does syntax highlighting work better for some languages?<#>Q
Should I make my projects open source - publicly available?<#>Q
I have several personal projects.<#>NQ
Like every developer, I get new ideas every day.<#>NQ
Often, I start my own projects, which I get to different levels of completion.  <#>NQ
Too often, I face the question of making them public, exposing other developers to my code and ideas.<#>NQ
This makes me wonder, should I really do that?<#>Q
or why not?  <#>Q
Please, give me reasons why make my projects open source, or why not.<#>NQ
Also, what benefits do I get from the different hosts (Source Forge, Google Code etc.<#>Q
Xml or Sqlite, When to drop Xml for a Database?<#>Q
I really like Xml for saving data, but when does sqlite/database become the better option?<#>Q
eg, when the xml has more than x items or is greater than y MB?<#>Q
I am coding an rss reader and I believe I made the wrong choice in using xml over a sqlite database to store a cache of all the feeds items.<#>NQ
There are some feeds which have an xml file of ~1mb after a month, another has over 700 items, while most only have ~30 items and are ~50kb in size after a several months. <#>NQ
I currently have no plans to implement a cap because I like to be able to search through everything.<#>NQ
So, my questions are:<#>NQ
updated (more info)<#>NQ
Every time a feed is selected in the GUI I reload all the items from that feeds xml file.<#>NQ
I also need to modify the read/unread status which seems really hacky when I loop through all nodes in the xml to find the item and then set it to read/unread.<#>NQ
Any experience with Open Search Server?<#>Q
I'm discovering what seems to be a GOOD web crawler called: Open Search Server.<#>NQ
Is anyone aware of it, or used it in real world scenarios?<#>Q
What do you think of it compared to Apache Nutch?<#>Q
Constructing a good customer survey<#>NQ
What questions can I ask and what other considerations are important to make this survey effective, so that people actually fill it out?<#>Q
I will be distributing it only to existing customers of my small e-product, to collect testimonials and other general information from my customer base.<#>NQ
I plan on using Google Docs to conduct the survey, but was wondering if someone has some good advice on questions that I can use.<#>NQ
I have planned a couple:<#>NQ
Also, should I be breaking it into multiple sections/multiple pages?<#>Q
(Google Docs has that option.<#>NQ
Do you leverage Semantic Web technologies?<#>Q
Why or why not?<#>Q
I'm interested in understanding why people choose to leverage technology built on the W3C Semantic Web standards.<#>NQ
How did you make the decision to use the technology you chose and what does it enable you to do that you identify as being unique to the Semantic Web effort?<#>Q
If you have specifically made the decision not to use Semantic Web technologies what are your reasons for that decision?<#>Q
What would have to change to cause you to revisit your decision?<#>Q
Note: I know there are many different types of semantic computing technologies besides those specified by the W3C but please keep answers to this subjective question focused on the W3C technologies (RDF, OWL, SPARQL).<#>NQ
Disclaimer: I focus on semantic computing incubation's at Microsoft.<#>NQ
Common Java technologies that actually modify .class files and their drawbacks?<#>NQ
At first I was a bit shocked when reading this part from the JiBX doc:<#>NQ
Having a tool modifying .class files seemed at first quite weird then I noticed that JiBX actually has quite some advantages (including speed) and I was wondering...<#>NQ
What are common technologies/framework/APIs used in the Java world that do actually need to modify .class files and what are their drawbacks?<#>Q
To me it complicates unit testing and it can also complicate stack trace reading but I may be mistaken (well, at least for obsfuscators I'm not mistaken: they do complicate stack trace reading which is more or less one of the main point of such a tool in the first place ; )<#>NQ
(I realize obsfuscators/code-scramblers like Proguard do actually modify .class file, but that is for an obvious reason).<#>NQ
What is your favourite plugin in Emacs?<#>NQ
Useful Perl modules<#>NQ
What is the most important module you pull off of CPAN to add to a stock Perl install?<#>Q
One module only per response, please.<#>NQ
Please explain why you think the module is best-of-breed <#>Q
Any examples of very shocking undefined behavior?<#>Q
People often comment that a program can legitimately respond to undefined behavior by deciding to reformat your hard drive.<#>NQ
However, in practice undefined behaviors in most languages do something rather unsurprising, for example:<#>NQ
I have yet to see a serious C++ compiler that responds to u = (u++); by reformatting the hard drive.<#>NQ
I also have yet to see a case where this assigned the value of u+2 to u, though this would only be a mildly surprising rather than shocking.<#>NQ
Can anyone offer real-world examples where the undefined behavior was incredibly shocking and/or weird?<#>Q
ExpressionEngine 1.6.9: displaying a weblog at all pages<#>NQ
I'm a EE newbie.<#>NQ
I have the code below.<#>NQ
the poll weblog displays at search result page, but doesn't display at blog and post details page :/ what am I missing?<#>Q
display at search result page: www.blabla.com/search/noresults/d8ee432f229715a4adfbe1cc0d21049a/<#>NQ
NO display at blog pages: www.blabla.com/blog/   or  www.blabla.com/blog/post/lorem_ipsum_is_simply_dummy_text/<#>NQ
Appreciate helps!!!!<#>NQ
Thanks a lot!<#>NQ
What approach do you use to find information on how a class/method/framework works?<#>Q
I ran into a question today, where the author referenced the documentation for a particular framework but had questions about how a class actually worked.<#>NQ
The documentation was not as clear as it could be -- turned out the information was there once you figured out that you needed to look at the parent class for a description of one of the arguments.<#>NQ
I went to the link, dug around in the source code for the class (also linked on the page) and found the answer, I think, pretty easily.<#>NQ
It made me curious, what sources people use find answers to questions outside of StackOverflow, of course.<#>NQ
What progression do you use?<#>Q
Does it matter how mature the framework is?<#>Q
I'll add my own thoughts as an answer in keeping with the SO FAQ.<#>NQ
What coding techniques do you use for optimising C programs?<#>Q
Some years ago I was on a panel that was interviewing candidates for a relatively senior embedded C programmer position.<#>NQ
One of the standard questions that I asked was about optimisation techniques.<#>NQ
I was quite surprised that some of the candidates didn't have answers.<#>NQ
So, in the interests of putting together a list for posterity - what techniques and constructs do you normally use when optimising C programs?<#>Q
Answers to optimisation for speed and size both accepted.<#>NQ
Worst security hole you've seen?<#>Q
What is the worst security hole you've ever seen?<#>Q
It is probably a good idea to keep details limited to protect the guilty.<#>NQ
For what it's worth, here's a question about what to do if you find a security hole, and another with some useful answers if a company doesn't (seem to) respond.<#>NQ
What are some good, useful, applications created using C# / .net?<#>Q
I know that there are two obvious answers: sharpDevelop and Paint.net.<#>NQ
But I was thinking the other day, what else is out there?<#>Q
What are some good, useful, applications created using C# / .net ?<#>Q
Here are the answers.<#>NQ
Feel free to add to this post.<#>NQ
Vote on Pros and Cons of Java HTML to XML cleaners<#>NQ
I am looking to allow HTML emails (and other HTML uploads) without letting in scripts and stuff.<#>NQ
I plan to have a white list of safe tags and attributes as well as a whitelist of CSS tags and value regexes (to prevent automatic return receipt).<#>NQ
I asked a question: Parse a badly formatted XML document (like an HTML file)<#>NQ
I found there are many many ways to do this.<#>NQ
Some systems have built in sanitizers (which I don't care so much about).<#>NQ
This page is a very nice listing page but I get kinda lost http://java-source.net/open-source/html-parsers<#>NQ
It is very important that the parsers never throw an exception.<#>NQ
There should always be best guess results to the parse/clean.<#>NQ
It is also very important that the result is valid XML that can be traversed in Java.<#>NQ
I posted some product information and said Community Wiki.<#>NQ
Please post any other product suggestions you like and say Community Wiki so they can be voted on.<#>NQ
Also any comments or wiki edits on what part of a certain product is better and what is not would be greatly appreciated.<#>NQ
(for example,, speed vs accuracy..)<#>NQ
It seems that we will go with either jsoup (seems more active and up to date) or TagSoup (compatible with JDK4 and been around awhile).<#>NQ
A +1 for any of these products would be if they could convert all style sheets into inline style on the elements which is necessary to be practical about locking down CSS so it does not mess with other HTML on the page.<#>NQ
Web Services framework versus a custom XML over HTTP protocol?<#>Q
I am looking for specific guidelines for when to use Web Services frameworks versus a well-documented custom protocol that communicates using XML over HTTP.<#>NQ
I am less concerned about performance than I am about maintainability and ease-of-development both for client-side and server-side code.<#>NQ
For example, I can develop a custom protocol that talks XML without writing tons of descriptor files that Web Services frameworks seem to require.<#>NQ
Please list specific features that Web Services bring to the table.<#>NQ
What college/university course(s) you wish you have taken more seriously?<#>Q
Admittedly back in college I was only interested on the programming courses.<#>NQ
Fortunately that includes the "Data Structures and Algorithms" course.<#>NQ
Now that I'm studying compilers I wish I had paid more attention on Automata Theory.<#>NQ
How about you?<#>Q
Compiled replies:<#>NQ
I noticed that most are related to mathematics.<#>NQ
Someone pointed out Math for Programmers from Steve Yegge.<#>NQ
Although most of these are major courses, it doesn't mean that we should ignore the non-majors.<#>NQ
It will bite you in the end as experienced by Derek Park.<#>NQ
What is your favorite educational programming pearl?<#>Q
A pearl is an elegant, instructive and fun example of programming, which teaches important  techniques and fundamental design principles.<#>NQ
For example, I really enjoyed the programming pearl Automata via Macros.<#>NQ
It shows how to build a construct for finite state machines using Scheme macros, while touching upon the importance of tail-call optimization.<#>NQ
So, what's your favorite programming pearl?<#>Q

Best Scripting/Programming language for automated seller/buyer for online games<#>NQ
I'm a database developer that works in Java (with C# experience), and I'm looking to write a script for a buying/selling bot that is portable between different online games.<#>NQ
Is there a way this can be done in Java or C#?<#>Q
If not, what is the language that can that is closest in syntax to these two.<#>NQ
The GUI of the game needs to be manipulated.<#>NQ
Sorry if this is unclear.<#>NQ
I've never dealt with scripting before.<#>NQ
Thanks in advance!<#>NQ
Which are your favorite GDB tricks?<#>Q
Which is your favorite macro/trick in gdb?<#>Q

How do I add survey capabilities for my users<#>Q
I need to add survey capability to my social website so that each user is able to create and manage their own surveys/polls etc. <#>NQ
Can anyone recommend any existing application for this?<#>Q
PHP-MySQL combo preferred.<#>NQ
Underused Features of HTML<#>NQ
Yes, many web developers live and breathe HTML, but there are still tags and tricks that aren't used as often as they could be.<#>NQ
What are some of your favorites?<#>Q
Python-specific antipatterns and bad practices<#>NQ
What python-specific antipatterns do you know?<#>Q
Could you also give an example, please.<#>NQ
Open source .NET tools<#>NQ

What is the best reason for unit testing?<#>Q
There's a lot of discussion about unit testing these days.<#>NQ
Here's a poll for the best reason to do it.<#>NQ
ONLY ONE REASON PER ANSWER PLEASE!<#>NQ
What language resource files are used in different programming languages/frameworks?<#>Q
As the question suggests, I would like to know as many different language resource file name &amp; formats as possible based on the programming language.<#>NQ
For example, in .net we have the .resx files in an XML format.<#>NQ
What are the best Ruby or Rails blogs?<#>Q
So what are your favorite Ruby or Ruby on Rails blogs?<#>Q
One link per post please and short description would be nice.<#>NQ
UnitTest how do you organise your testing files?<#>Q
Currently, I am splitting all my tests by package (projects).<#>NQ
So if I have 12 projects, I will create 1 more project for Unit Test with 12 classes that will test all my package. <#>NQ
Do you do the same way or do you have 1 testing class by class?<#>Q
How do you organize all your test?<#>Q
C++ constructs replacing C constructs<#>NQ
After discussing with a newly arrived developer in my team, I realized that there are still, in C++, habits of using C constructs because they are supposed to be better (i.e.<#>NQ
faster, leaner, prettier, pick your reason).<#>NQ
What are the examples worth sharing, showing a C constructs, compared to the similar C++ construct?<#>Q
For each example, I need to read the reasons the C++ construct is as good as or even better the original C construct.<#>NQ
The aim is to offer alternatives to some C constructs that are considered somewhat dangerous/unsafe in C++ code (C++0x valid only answers are accepted as long as clearly marked as C++0x only).<#>NQ
I'll post below an answer (struct inline initialization) as an example.<#>NQ
Note 1: Please, one answer per case.<#>NQ
If you have multiple cases, please post multiple answers<#>NQ
Note 2:This is not a C question.<#>NQ
Do not add the "C" tag to this question.<#>NQ
This is not supposed to become a fight between C++ and C. Only the study of some constructs of the C subset of C++, and their alternative in other C++ "toolkits"<#>NQ
Note 3: This is not a C-bashing question.<#>NQ
I want reasons.<#>NQ
Boasting, bashing, and unproven comparisons will be downmodded.<#>NQ
Mentioning C++ features without a C equivalent could be considered out of topic: I want the put side by side a C feature against a C++ feature.<#>NQ
What are the best uses for each programming language?<#>Q
I come from a web developer background, so I'm fairly familiar with PHP and JavaScript, but I'd eventually like to branch out into other languages.<#>NQ
At this point, I don't have a particular direction or platform that I'm leaning toward as far as learning a new language or what I would use it for, but I would like to learn a little bit more about programming languages in general and what each one is used for.<#>Q
I've often heard (and I agree) that you should use the right tool for the job, so what jobs are each programming language best suited for? <#>Q
Edit: If you've worked with some of the newer or more obscure languages, please share for those as well.<#>NQ
Capability Im-Maturity Model<#>NQ
Found an article about Capabilty Im-Maturity Model (CIMM)<#>NQ
that complements the CMM levels (1-5) with levels 0 to -3:<#>NQ
I have never worked in projects on level -3, but certainly experienced the other levels.<#>NQ
Which levels have you worked in CIMM or CMM?<#>Q
The most abusive C++ you've ever seen used?<#>Q
I'm curious to know, what is the most abrasive, caustic, abusive but perfectly legal and correct C++ you've ever seen ship out the door?<#>Q
This question isn't meant to be a C++ bashing session, but a humorous introspection into the world of C++ we allow ourselves (or others) to get away with.<#>NQ
Most crucial elements in a light-weight C++ coding standard<#>NQ
I've been involved in developing coding standards which were quite elaborate.<#>NQ
My own experience is that it was hard to enforce if you don't have proper processes to maintain it and strategies to uphold it.<#>NQ
Now I'm working in, and leading, an environment even less probable to have processes and follow-up strategies in quite a while.<#>NQ
Still I want to uphold some minimum level of respectable code.<#>NQ
So I thought I would get good suggestions here, and we might together produce a reasonable light-weight subset of the most important coding standard practices for others to use as reference.<#>NQ
So, to emphasize the essence here:<#>NQ
 What elements of a C++ coding standard are the most crucial to uphold?<#>Q
Animation in C++<#>NQ
What are ways to draw animations in C++?<#>Q
Would you recommend a class pattern in particular to get the drawing and redrawing done? <#>Q
Do you know of any open source project where animations are made so I can take a peek at the code?<#>Q
Where would you start if you wanted to code geometrical animations?<#>Q
Do you know of any good libraries?<#>Q
Post links to tutorials and any other interesting information...<#>NQ
"Hidden Secrets" of the Visual Studio .NET debugger?<#>Q
As much as I generally don't like the discussion/subjective posts on SO, I have really come to appreciate the "Hidden Secrets" set of posts that people have put together.<#>NQ
They provide a great overview of some commonly missed tools that you might now otherwise discover.<#>NQ
For this question I would like to explore the Visual Studio .NET debugger.<#>NQ
What are some of the "hidden secrets" in the VS.NET debugger that you use often or recently discovered and wish you would have known long ago?<#>Q
Deploying .NET applications to Amazon EC2 - what AMI image to use?<#>Q
What AMI images do you use when deploying or testing .NET applications at Amazon EC2?<#>Q
So far I've been using Mono 2.2. on Fedora 8.<#>NQ
It does the job, but I would love to see the options more suited for somebody coming from the MS Stack.<#>NQ
What reference materials would you bring to a programming competition?<#>Q
For the ACM-ICPC programming competition, teams are allowed to bring any printed materials.<#>NQ
Books, pages of equations, even code.<#>NQ
Language documentation (e.g.<#>NQ
the Java API) can be accessed online.<#>NQ
So far, we're bringing geometry equations that could be useful, implementation of a few algorithms that can be tricky to get exactly right such as binary search, and any textbooks that look useful.<#>NQ
Can you recommend any other materials that might be useful?<#>Q
What is your favorite IDE for Perl development?<#>Q
What is your favorite IDE for Perl development and why?<#>Q

Best free java SE profiler<#>NQ
Could you propose best free java SE profiler please?<#>Q
'Best' = 'most feature rich' &amp; 'most user friendly'.<#>NQ
'Most' = 'used to form the superlative of many adjectives and adverbs' ;)<#>NQ
Best Multi-Language Documentation Generator<#>NQ
What is the best documentation generator?<#>Q
I want to something that will easily add templates for documenting functions, classes, etc.<#>NQ
I know there are several tools out there -- from Visual Studio plugins to external applications that take code files as input.<#>NQ
What is the best documentation generator?<#>Q
Bonus points if they're free / open source.<#>NQ
JavaEE industry standards<#>NQ
I am new to java.<#>NQ
I have been developing in python for a few years.<#>NQ
I have read introduction from Oracle and now I am wondering what are the industry standards in javaEE development?<#>Q
Which frameworks is worth using?<#>Q
I am planning to deploy my projects on Google App Engine (is it good idea?<#>Q
), therefore I believe that JPO is one of the main subjects.<#>NQ
After few hours I feel pretty comfortable with it.<#>NQ
How about Struts, Spring, Hibernate?<#>Q
And all the big names?<#>Q
What techniques and frameworks are used to create large scale web applications such as banks, shops and so on?<#>Q
Could you give me a hint in which direction should I go?<#>Q
How much time and effort do you spend on IE6?<#>Q
I've often read that corporations will save millions once Internet Explorer 6 is finally laid to rest, but reading quotes like that make me wonder just how much time people are spending on IE6 development.<#>NQ
I'll be happy once IE6 goes, but I've found that if I write valid HTML and CSS, use a JavaScript framework, keep the transparent images issue in mind, and don't try to over-complicate my design, I only need to write a few lines of IE6-specific CSS, which usually takes about 10-15 minutes.<#>NQ
So I'm curious, how much time, effort, and money do you or your corporation spend on preparing your sites for IE6?<#>Q
Also, at what point will you drop IE6 support?<#>Q
If you've already dropped support, what has been your experience in terms of saved time and money and what has the switch done to your conversion rates and customer satisfaction?<#>Q
Setting up a secure polling system<#>NQ
I'm currently in charge of setting up a polling system (using PHP). <#>NQ
Now for it to be as secure and objective as possible, it's important that a visitor can only vote once.<#>NQ
I'm thinking of validating the polls by visitor's IP (there can be only one vote from one IP), and maybe throw in a captcha test to be sure that no bots can get in once they've passed the IP validation for some reason.<#>NQ
Thanks in advance.<#>NQ
What custom Stylecop rules have you written?<#>Q
We're going to be integrating StyleCop into our build system in a couple of weeks.<#>NQ
Trolling the web gave me some nice ideas for custom rules that could come in handy, such as a rule for filtering for profanity and sorting your members alphabetically (love this one).<#>NQ
Have you written any custom rules?<#>Q
What are they?<#>Q
Credit Card Payment Solutions for Desktop Applications<#>NQ
There are a whole raft of questions regarding payment processors for web applications but I haven't seen one yet for desktop applications.<#>NQ
What are your experiences?<#>Q

Etymology of linux commands<#>NQ
Just for fun ...<#>NQ
I tend to keep myself alert by looking for serendipitous puzzles throughout the day.<#>NQ
One of the things I love about linux is the never-ending amount of cleverness it embodies, from its elegant simplicity all the way to the comments in its manual pages.<#>NQ
Can you articulate the unwritten rules that dictate how new commands are named, or provide some history behind common commands?<#>Q
What essential command is missing from stock linux distros--what would it do, and what would you name it?<#>Q
Bonus Puzzle:  One of our long-time customers was MCI, and their shipping address was 1101 Summit Ave.  Now, MCI was a large company and probably could have chosen any address ... so why 1101?<#>NQ
Amazingly, I've never come across an MCI employee who knew this answer ... but they didn't have SO back then!<#>NQ
EDIT: Before this gets out of hand:  please donotsimply list commands!<#>NQ
I'm looking for answers to the questions initalicsabove.<#>NQ
How many languages are used in your team?<#>Q
I've heard two good pieces of advice when it comes to choosing which language to use in a development team.<#>NQ
To paraphrase:<#>NQ
These two are not mutually exclusive of course, but I was wondering to what degree different development teams tend towards one or the other.<#>NQ
My suspicion is that most shops lean heavily towards one language in particular.<#>NQ
I'm not talking about different domain-specific languages, such as C#, HTML, JS, XML, etc.<#>NQ
which all coexist performing different tasks in the same project.<#>NQ
Rather, I'm interested in the primary development language for your projects, e.g.<#>NQ
Java, VB, C#, Delphi, Perl, etc.<#>NQ
How many "main" languages are used in your team?<#>Q
Why does that work (or not work) for you?<#>Q
What are some practical uses of metaprogramming that you've seen in C++?<#>Q
Do you really use your reverse domain for package naming in java?<#>Q
For a long time ago, I have thought that, in java, reversing the domain you own for package naming is silly and awkward.<#>NQ
Which do you use for package naming in your projects?<#>Q
Avoding JSP in all in our presentation layer?<#>Q
We have decided to choose Wicket or Vaadin for our presentation layer.<#>NQ
But i would like to have a question on why do people say JSP is painful? <#>Q
Today being in the discussion people just flamed at JSP and they were not so ease minded as some were coming with embedding Java code in HTML tags which is painful<#>NQ
I know Wicket and Vaadin does a great job, But does JSP really lacks and needs a lot of improvement. <#>NQ
How do I find methods?<#>Q
Here's a somewhat general computer question.<#>NQ
I've always been able to follow the LOGIC of programming, but when I go to code something, I always find that I don't know some method or another to get what I need to get done.<#>NQ
When I see it, I always think, "OF COURSE!<#>NQ
How do you go about finding relevant methods for your programming needs that are "built-in?<#>Q
" I don't enjoy re-inventing the wheel, but I find it difficult to find what I need to do what I want to do.<#>NQ
Poll: ASP.Net Data Access Methodologies<#>NQ
With .Net 3.5 SP1 adding Entity Data Model as an option for data access we are now faced with several out of the box options; EDM, LINQ-to-SQL, Typed Datasets, pure ADO.Net.<#>NQ
We also have several open source options; Subsonic, NHibernate, LLBLGen.<#>NQ
So the question for the poll:<#>NQ
What is your single favorite Data Access Methodology for ASP.Net?<#>Q
(Remember if your favorite is already listed just vote it up.<#>NQ
What was your first attempt at a project, as a newbie?<#>Q
I started on a password database (think KeePass) in Pascal when I was 13.<#>NQ
I was so busy with making a functional text user interface (similar to Borland Pascal 7.0), that I didn't get to encrypting the password file.<#>NQ
I was just replacing each character in a CSV (not really knowing it was called that) with its ASCII value.<#>NQ
Needless to say, I long lost interest and the source code.<#>NQ
Web Programming Grand Challenges?<#>Q
Are you satisfied with the current state of web programming?<#>Q
What fundamental changes or improvements would you suggest to vastly improve the state of the art of web programming?<#>Q
What problems do these developments address?<#>Q
In other words:<#>NQ
What are the Grand Challenges of Web Programming Technology?<#>Q
What is the most efficient way to repeat an action every x minutes?<#>Q
I have an application that runs in JBoss.<#>NQ

I want to poll this list from another class every 60 seconds.<#>NQ
What would be the most efficient way of doing this? <#>Q
Could anyone point me to a good example? <#>Q
What's the best database framework for PHP?<#>Q
After graduating from calling the mysql_* functions directly in my code, I've stepped up to a home-brewed database abstraction class.<#>NQ
Now, I'm beginning to think that I should really use a "professional" DB class instead.<#>NQ
I know there are a lot of them out there (ADODB, PDO, MDB2, etc) but I want to know which one I should try out.<#>NQ
What do you feel is the best one and why?<#>Q
Is there a wiki that also contains architectural diagrams?<#>Q
I like a wiki to contain information that needs to be known within a team.<#>NQ
Having the expression in mind, "A picture is worth a thousand words", I would like to make a small class diagram, sequence diagram or component diagram inside a wiki using an ajax or flash plugin.<#>NQ
We currently don't do any technical design because they are often lost in some program or out dated.<#>NQ
Being able to put these in a wiki (and update them there) would make them useful again.<#>NQ
Do you know of any wiki's that have that functionality?<#>Q
Securing data by physical isolation<#>NQ
I was having a conversation recently discussing security approaches.<#>NQ
It had to do with the idea that data placed on a networked device can never be completely secure.<#>NQ
In the age of the Internet and on-demand data availability, are there situations where data security and integrity is so important, the information is stored on an isolated and non-networked machine?<#>Q
Does anyone have any examples or thoughts on this idea?<#>Q
Can you get a job thanks to your Prolog skills?<#>Q
This Prolog question is introduced as an interview question.<#>NQ
Is it used in the industry?<#>Q
(ok, ok, a job can be out of the industry too).<#>NQ
Unknown significant moments of computing history<#>NQ
Computing as a discipline in its own right (rather than as a discussion of whether it is Mathematics or Physics) is a reasonably young science.<#>NQ
Wherever you trace its roots (e.g.<#>NQ
Turing's paper in 1936, Babbage's engines, ATLAS, ENIAC or LEO) it's much younger than most modern nation states. <#>NQ
I've been programming (using the loosest definition) for close to 30 years but it still seems to me that I come across parts of its history that are new to me.<#>NQ
While it shouldn't surprise me that while I studied computing at school, at University, post-grad and now as a day-job, that there is stuff I don't know, it still causes a small pause when I read an article about something which seems pivotal but about which I know absolutely nothing. <#>NQ
For instance, this news item describes a conference which looks to have sown the seeds for many things that have come since.<#>NQ
It was 1968, the world was young, IBM was old, Microsoft and Sun barely in glint in their creators' eyes; the notion of separating hardware and software was new, the largest institutions had networks that numbered in the dozens of machines.<#>NQ
Yet some of their conclusions are fresh and remain unresolved, in particular managing large projects.<#>NQ
(The proceedings are fascinating and full of lessons for the future software engineer.<#>NQ
The question is YASOP (*) - what piece of computing history do you think still has significance to our current industry but you feel people don't know enough about? <#>Q
(*) Yet Another Stack Overflow Poll <#>NQ
How would you describe the difference between Managed/Byte Code and Unmanaged/Native Code to a Non-Programmer?<#>Q
Sometimes it's difficult to describe some of the things that "us programmers" may think are simple to non-programmers and management types.<#>NQ
use cases for well-known Java software packages<#>NQ
I am browsing some of the Java software packages (Guice, GWT, JAX-RS, etc.<#>NQ
) and my head is spinning quite a bit because I don't really know the use cases when these particular software packages shine.<#>NQ
The tutorials seem to show you how to do something with their package, but not why you would want to use their package (or in which cases you would not).<#>NQ
So I'm wondering if people could post some use cases (or "don't use cases") for Java libraries for which this may not be obvious, to complement the canonical what-are-good-free-Java-libraries question.<#>Q
I have a particular interest regarding Guice but it's kind of a more general question.<#>NQ
edit: if you are aware of a really good webpage that answers this question for a particular package (e.g. explains use cases for Hibernate or JAXB or whatever), please link to it.<#>NQ
Successful Domain-Specific Languages ?<#>NQ
Which one do you use?<#>Q
I'm interested in Domain Specific Languagess design and implementation.<#>NQ
Much of the DSLs that I know stem from the academic world.<#>NQ
Can you give me some pointers to DSLs that are actually used in the industry ?<#>Q
and that you use on a daily-basis...which are really convenient..<#>NQ
(I'm interested in declarative languages too, but not really xml-based ones...)...<#>NQ
I'd like to establish a (non-exhaustive) list of industry-deployed languages...i know this is huge...<#>NQ
Sometimes, I'm implementing using a General Purpose Language things that could be trivially done using a DSL.<#>NQ
I'm mainly interested in application-directed DSLs, not small-embedded languages.<#>NQ
For instance, SQL matches what I'm looking for but SQL embedded in java does not interest me.<#>NQ
Another example of the kind of language i'm looking for is X#<#>NQ
How should I check if a flag is set in a flags enum?<#>Q
Of the two methods below, which do you prefer to read?<#>Q
Is there another (better?) way to check if a flag is set?<#>Q
Please vote up the method you prefer.<#>NQ
Which is the best jQuery-powered site?<#>Q
This "Top 10 JavaScript (jQuery) Powered Sites", posted about 2 years ago, was the one that invites me (after seeing the list) to use jQuery.<#>NQ
All the sites in that list made me realize how cool it is to build sites powered by jQuery.<#>NQ
And now more and more sites are being powered by jQuery.<#>NQ
More and more developers are learning jQuery.<#>NQ
Two years have past now but I still do a search to google for best sites and still got me to that link and which the link is not updated from the first time I have looked at it.<#>NQ
Here at stackoverflow, there are lots of jQuery user.<#>NQ
I was thinking if we can here show some of the sites that you know that is powered by jQuery which you think is best.<#>NQ
If you can, please make it one site one answer, so that we can make a vote if it's really best jQuery powered site.<#>NQ
We will take a look if it is really well implemented ( the way the codes are written, fast speed site, etc...) and deserves to be the best. <#>NQ
Lot's of viewers will benefit from it.<#>NQ
Like, we can view and have an idea of how we will make our next project cooler, faster, and powerful. <#>NQ
What is your favorite IPython feature?<#>Q
I've been learning (and enjoying learning!<#>NQ
) Python via the IPython interactive shell recently... What's your favorite feature in IPython?<#>Q
Are there any tips and tricks you've picked up that other people might not know about?<#>Q
Will you put the model part in asp.net mvc into a different library/assembly?<#>Q
Or should we put put the model part in asp.net mvc into a different library/assembly?<#>Q
Maximum number of type parameters used in a java class<#>NQ
What is the maximum number of type parameters you used in a java class?<#>Q

Are you using Google Guice in a production system?<#>Q
Have you found Guice useful to manage DI in you applications or run stress tests or even brought an application using Guice to a production phase in your company?<#>Q
If you have, have you run into any issues with it?<#>Q
What's the optimal way to store binary flags / boolean values in each database engine?<#>Q
I've seen some possible approaches (in some database engines some of them are synonyms):<#>NQ
All major database engine supported by PHP should be noted, but just as a refference it'll be even better if also other engines will be noted.<#>NQ
I'm asking for a design that is best optimized for reading.<#>NQ
SELECTing with the flag field in the WHERE condition, or GROUP BY the flag.<#>NQ
Performance is much more important than storage space (except when the size has an impact on performance).<#>NQ
And some more details:<#>NQ
While creating the table I can't know if it'll be sparse (if most flags are on or off), but I can ALTER the tables later on, so if there is something I can optimize if I know that, it should be noted.<#>NQ
Also if it's make a difference if there is only one flag (or a few) per row, versus many (or a lot of) flags it should be noted.<#>NQ
BTW, I've read somewhere in SO the following:<#>NQ
Well, in my case it doesn't worth nothing, because each table is represented by a class in my application and everything is explicitly defined in the class and well documented.<#>NQ
How does the above-average programmer learn today?<#>Q
Most of us know the quote "The average software developer reads less than one professional book per year..." from Peopleware <#>NQ
I am curious to know how (or if) it has changed since then - it's nice to know the trends in our 'profession'... and this seems to be a nice focus group to get some relevant answers from.<#>NQ
So I'm looking here for one-liner responses, that's be voted up if you truly practice to learn and be good at your job.<#>NQ
Keep the answers as distinct as possible - So Read dead-tree books would be a diff response than Read blog posts <#>NQ
So yes it's asurvey- andcomm wikiand maybe close-practice - let the comm decide.<#>NQ
There seems to be a similar question#43637- but it's too verbose and seems to have died off.<#>NQ
Though it does have a bunch of things that I'll use to seed the poll here<#>NQ
Update: To clarify what Jon posted as a comment, I'm not looking for trends from people who just happen to program (for whatever reasons) rather from people who love programming and wouldn't trade it for any other profession (or maybe aren't as good at pretty much anything else :) <#>NQ
When do you believe software AIs will truly be able to pass the Turing Test?<#>Q
When, if at all, do you believe that we will see AI systems that are capable of passing the Turing Test?<#>Q
This concept forms the basis of the Turing Test, a means to evaluate if an artificial intelligence is indistinguishable from a human being by observing its behavior and interaction with human beings.<#>NQ
As yet, no system has been able to pass as human (although numerous human been mistaken for machines).<#>NQ
If you believe that we will eventually build such systems, I would be curious to know what approach you think will be successful.<#>Q
If you don't think such a system is likely to be created any time soon, what do you think that obstacles are?<#>Q
It really looks like OS X has a bug when using poll() on a named pipe (FIFO)... can an expert confirm?<#>Q
I'm been trying to poll from a set of named-pipes for a little while now and i keep getting an immediate response of POLLNVAL on any named pipe file descriptor.<#>NQ
After finding this blog post about broken polling in OS X I'm pretty certain that this is a b-u-g bug in OS X.<#>NQ
I'm already planning on switching my code to using UDP sockets, but i wanted to ask SO for verification about this a) so that I'm sure it's really broken, and b) for documentation purposes.<#>NQ
Here is a stripped down version of the code I wrote (although the code in the link above, which I tested, spells it out pretty well):<#>NQ
this outputs:<#>NQ
ad nauseam.<#>NQ
Anybody else run into this?<#>Q
This is a real bug right?<#>Q
Do you work from code examples and snippets?<#>Q
How do you organize them?<#>Q
Find them?<#>Q
Succint version: <#>NQ
Do you have any suggestions about a repository where I can collect valuable C# / SQL / JavaScript / jQuery snippets and examples - and find them later?<#>Q
If so, please forward me a link!<#>NQ
Loquacious version:<#>NQ
I have a crappy memory.<#>NQ
Did I mention that already?<#>Q
Stop me if I repeat myself.<#>NQ
I've had to invent ways to compensate for my poor recall. <#>NQ
In a former life, my development environment provided a way to write a longish comment about each object in the app, which was stored in the library with the object.<#>NQ
I wrote a lot of methods, and each had a comment describing the method's purpose.<#>NQ
I created a tool that allowed me to search through those comments, presenting matching methods in a list.<#>NQ
If the method name didn't suffice, I could double-click to see the source code.<#>NQ
All my methods had a header that explained what it did and how it worked, and provided a usage example or two.<#>NQ
Once found, it was easy to apply.<#>NQ
Select the usage example, copy and paste into whatever you're coding, and alter the details to fit.<#>NQ
This made my working life work.<#>NQ
I encapsulated the tricky stuff in methods and had a means to find them -- when my crappy memory (did I mention that already?) failed me. <#>NQ
Now I'm in .NET, and objects have no convenient place for a descriptive comment, unless I embed them in the source.<#>NQ
I've seen numberless code snippets in books and web sites that I have never captured and cannot reproduce.<#>NQ
Do you retain and organize code snippets, so you can refer to them later?<#>Q
If so, how?<#>Q
Do you have a code repository of some kind?<#>Q
How do you keep track of those useful examples?<#>Q
I'm on the verge of undertaking to write my own repository, to keep track of the fabulous C#, SQL, jQuery code, etc that I create or come across. <#>NQ
If there are sites or applications that makes it easy to save examples and snippets, tag them perhaps, and FIND them later -- please post the link.<#>Q
Thanks, Hoytster<#>NQ
Why did you learn C?<#>Q
For those who know or are learning C: Why did you choose to learn C?<#>Q
Was a school or job requirement?<#>Q
I'm especially curious to know how many learned it to better understand the inner workings of their language of choice.<#>NQ
If this is your reason, was it prompted by Joel's suggestions?<#>Q
Best language for a non-programmer tech support person to learn<#>NQ
I have a colleague that handles tech support, and her role involves a lot of transforming ASCII files from one format to another and occasionally reporting on them.<#>NQ
The formats tend to be largely plain text with an occasional bit of XML.<#>NQ
She regularly gets me to write small scripts to do these transformatsions, and also batch files for repeating the operation for collections of files in different locations.<#>NQ
Currently she uses Crystal Reports to do much of this but it is a bit of a dog.<#>NQ
Could anyone recommend a language, or alternative tool, that she could learn to become more self reliant in this role.<#>Q
It must primarily be very easy to learn at a starting out level, be good at manipulating text files, and run in a Windows environment.<#>NQ
Ideally, it would also be freely available, such that she could pass her scripts onto her end users.<#>NQ
What's the program you've really wanted to write but never found the time?<#>Q
I think that the best, and maybe the only, thing to do to get better as a programmer is to program, i.e.<#>NQ
to create new stuff, build new apps, solve new problems.<#>NQ
But during our daily jobs we (well I can only speak for myself :)) usually do a lot of maintainance programming, debugging, support and other work that could be categorized as "not so fun".<#>NQ
So I'm looking for some interesting ideas to keep my fingers fast and my mind sharp.<#>NQ
It could be anything: a desktop app, a web app or just some cool feature added to an existing product you once thought would be really useful. <#>NQ
So what's your favourite non-implemented programming project idea?<#>Q
Thanks for all your answers!<#>NQ
Missing/desired features in Notepad++<#>NQ
What feature is missing or hidden in Notepad++, that can be added while keeping it still the small, fast and efficient source code editor that it is? <#>Q
Have you found a feature to be missing only to later discover a way to achieve this anyway, perhaps with a plug-in?<#>Q
Open Source Role Model Projects<#>NQ
What would you consider to be the best open source role model projects?<#>Q
I am curious about what projects to look at for inspiration in working on large projects, but I have heard rumors about some projects being over grown and quite messy.<#>NQ
I'm less concerned with the size of the project or the language it's in, just that it's logically laid out and somewhat easy to follow.<#>NQ
There must be some projects in the open source community that would make great case studies of design and collaboration.<#>NQ
So what projects do you think have the best design, the best use of algorithms, the best tests, etc.<#>Q
What's the best alternative to C++ for real-time graphics programming?<#>Q
C++ just sucks too much of my time by making me micro-manage my own memory, making me type far too much (hello std::vector&lt;Thingy&gt;::const_iterator it = lotsOfThingys.begin()), and boring me with long compile times.<#>NQ
What's the single best alternative for serious real-time graphics programming?<#>Q
Garbage collection is a must (as is the ability to avoid its use when necessary), and speed must be competitive with C++.<#>NQ
A reasonable story for accessing C libs is also a must.<#>NQ
(Full disclosure: I have my own answer to this, but I'm interested to see what others have found to be good alternatives to C++ for real-time graphics work.<#>NQ
Edit: Thanks everyone for the thoughtful replies.<#>NQ
Given that there's really no "right" answer to this question I won't be selecting any particular answer.<#>NQ
Besides I'd just pick the language I happen to like as a C++ alternative, which wouldn't really be fair.<#>NQ
Confused about how to approach a registration and polling of messages with Android<#>Q
what I need to do is auto-register device if not already done and then start polling messages with the credentials I received through this registration.<#>NQ
Now, after I read quite a bit about services, threads, asynctasks and the AlarmManager I'm totally confused about how to handle this.<#>NQ
So, there are my two main tasks.<#>NQ
What would you recommend as a not-too-silly approach<#>Q
I'm currently spawning a service from my UI thread if there are no credentials saved in the DB.<#>NQ
Inside this service I start an asynctask that POSTs my request to the server and receives the credentials for the new device.<#>NQ
stopSelf ends the service.<#>NQ
Would you guys play it like that?<#>Q
I have not a single clue how I should do that.<#>Q
I'd like to poll messages quite often during the app is on top, lets say every minute.<#>NQ
Otherwise, when the app is not running I thought about using the setInexactRepeating() method of the AlarmManager and poll lets say every 15 minutes. <#>NQ
Is there a better or a more gentle on resources way to do that?<#>Q
Thanks a lot!<#>NQ
Which shopping cart module can you recommend?<#>Q
I am looking for a customizable web shop / shopping cart platform (Could be open source or not).<#>NQ
Does anyone have specific recommendations?<#>Q
Can we improve the Joel Test?<#>Q
I was recently answering a question referring to the Joel Test and found that our company did not do well on some points (hallway usability testing and daily builds) but that these points for our company are relatively minor, while I agree that some points are an absolutely must (source control, bug database, interviewees writing code).<#>NQ
Now, the Joel Test is good due to its simplicity and I am not really asking to replace it.<#>NQ
Nevertheless, are there some points that you find are missing in the original test or some that should not be there?<#>Q
What weight would you give each point?<#>Q
For reference, here is the original test:<#>NQ
I will write my own answer into the answer section, since you may like the question but not my answer.<#>NQ
Do you practice the planning game?<#>Q
In our small development team we are adopting the agile way of developing our software.<#>NQ
We try to stick to one month development cycles.<#>NQ
At the beginning we play what we call "the planning game".<#>NQ
The idea is to filter out all the issues and find out the ones to be handled in the upcoming iteration.<#>NQ
Here it is in a nutshell: every person (developer, user, analyst, etc.), involved in the project, is more or less aware of all the minor and major issues.<#>NQ
Also, everybody has a more or less definitive wishlist of issues to be fixed in the upcoming iteration.<#>NQ
Everyone takes several small square pieces of paper (5 to 10) and writes down all the important (in his opinion) issues -- one issue per one piece.<#>NQ
Now, all the pieces are stuck to a whiteboard, but not randomly.<#>NQ
The left edge of the board is priority, while the bottom is complexity (like Y and X axes).<#>NQ
All the papers are sorted out based on priority and complexity.<#>NQ
Thus, a simple and not urgent ends up in the left bottom corner, moderate complexity / priority -- in the middle, and extremely complex but urgent in the right-top.<#>NQ
Well, you get it...<#>NQ
After a bit of discussing and tossing the papers around we have all of them arranged properly on the whiteboard.<#>NQ
Of course, we might get rid of some of the papers along the way, because we don't want to be overwhelmed.<#>NQ
Once we are done we do not remove the papers.<#>NQ
On the contrary, we let them stay during the iteration.<#>NQ
After issue is fixed we put a big cross on the corresponding piece of paper.<#>NQ
Personally, I really enjoy this step ;)<#>NQ
Well, now the question: do you practice anything like that in your team?<#>Q
If you do, how effective do you find this approach, how much do you like it, have you met any problems with this?<#>Q
Yes, this is subjective, but I personally really enjoy this game and it seems to help a bit during planning and even development phase to stay concentrated on the issue.<#>NQ
So, your answers are really appreciated.<#>NQ
Model Django Poll<#>NQ
I am working through the Django tutorials, and now I am at creating a poll. <#>NQ
The code below works fine until I want to create choices, where for some reason I always get this error message: <#>NQ
What am I doing wrong?<#>Q
Here's my code:<#>NQ
Logging conventions<#>NQ
What conventions do you use for log categories in log4j or similar libraries ?<#>Q
Usually you see class names as categories, but have you used other systems ?<#>Q
What about log levels ?<#>Q
What levels do you use and in which case ?<#>Q
Update: as some of you replied, there is no 'right' answer.<#>NQ
I'm just looking for what different conventions people use as a possible source of inspiration.<#>NQ
What feature is missing or hidden in Vim?<#>Q
I thought I'd have a try at using Win32 GVim, and I'm finding that it's much more versatile than I realised.<#>NQ
At this point I'm finding that for myself a lot of its features are still hidden.<#>NQ
As an example I'm used to having a button on the toolbar to run external commands and capturing the output but I found in Vim it's :%!&lt;command&gt; to get this.<#>NQ
I'm wondering what are the limitations of Vim itself (i.e. not Vi's).<#>NQ
What, if any, are the features that you've found missing in Vim?<#>Q
Also have you subsequently found a way to enable this feature after all? <#>Q
Favorite Online Judge Challenge<#>NQ
For years I have visited the UVa Online Judge site to practice programming skills and just recently ( thanks to this site ) discovered the Sphere Online Judge site.<#>NQ
I am interested to know which challenges from these sites folks here found the most interesting, difficult, satisfying, perplexing, or amusing.<#>NQ
Does your team have its own coding guidelines?<#>Q

Hidden features of HTTP<#>NQ
What hidden features of HTTP do you think are worth mentioning?<#>Q
By hidden features I mean features that already are part of the standard but widely rather unknown or unused.<#>NQ

Favorite .NET Unit Testing framework<#>NQ
I've been using NUnit for a few years.<#>NQ
I've tried MBUnit for a short while as well as Zenebug and XUnit but I keep coming back to NUnit.<#>NQ
What is your favorite/most used Unit test Framework?<#>Q
Can you explain why you're using it?<#>Q
What different ways can you write this<#>Q
There are some cool and exciting features in .NET 3.5/C# 3.0, and with those features comes some darn interesting ways to write the exact same line of code.<#>NQ
Using the above stated tool set (and by extension .NET 2.0 stuff), what are the different ways the below code snippet could reasonably be rewritten? <#>Q
State Licensing for Programmers<#>NQ
In the U.S should programmers be licensed to practice much like electricians must be licensed to practice in the state they are in?<#>Q
Personally I would be opposed to such an idea due to feasibility and political issues but I am curious what others think.<#>NQ
Thoughts...<#>NQ
I could see some merit to the concept and with software being a mission critical component for so many systems I see the social need for some sort of consumer protection.<#>NQ
I have also discussions with non-programmers about a lack of a programmer "code" (usually in the context of explaining why programmers are not interchangeable commodities)... for example, to my knowledge, electricians need to wire to code and it appears to be fairly easy for another electrician to follow up on a previous electricians work.<#>NQ
The same is not true, in my experience, with programmers.<#>NQ
Is there enough peer policing of the industry?<#>Q
Should there be more sites like The Daily WTF?<#>Q
Does vendor certification provide enough consumer protection?<#>Q
Java “must-have” development tools<#>NQ
Java doesn't seem nearly as "well served" as .NET with tool lists on the Internet.<#>NQ
There's James Selvakumar’s article entitled "Must have tools for a Java Developer" which has items I don't agree with.<#>NQ
Do FireFox and MySQL qualify as development tools?<#>Q
There is also the Java Power Tools book.<#>NQ
Assuming you already have a half-decent IDE and source safe repository, what three Java tools are on your "must-have" list?<#>Q
Update (03/11) : Summary of the answers:<#>NQ
What are the benefits of functional programming?<#>Q
What do you think the benefits of functional programming are?<#>Q
And how do they apply to programmers today?<#>Q
What are the greatest differences between functional programming and OOP? <#>Q
How do we define Code Quality?<#>Q
Does anyone have a reasonable definition of Code Quality?<#>Q
I don't think there is a good definition, and I see plenty of bad definitions.<#>NQ
There are many definitions for Correctness, but I would expect correctness to be a given, and quality is meaningless if the code is broken.<#>NQ
I suspect quality is something like:<#>NQ
but that's just hopeless.<#>NQ
Does anyone have any better definitions?<#>Q
Which concept from mathematics has helped you the most in development?<#>Q
It is well known there is a strong link between computer science and mathematics.<#>NQ
In looking to improve my own software engineering skill set I'm interested to know what concept from mathematics has helped you to gain deeper understanding of software development as a whole?<#>Q
What would be the biggest bang-for-your-buck concept to learn from the domain of mathematics that would carry over into a software engineering career?<#>Q
As a somewhat heavyweight example, Alex Stepanov of STL fame has often compared concepts in C++ (DefaultConstructible, Assignable, Regular, etc.) to concepts from abstract algebra (groups, rings, monoids, etc.)<#>NQ
In fact much of the direction C++ is going (generic programming) can find its roots back in his initial observations.<#>NQ
In his latest book he recommends brushing up on Chrystal's work on Algebra, which is a bit too much for me to chew off, but the point remains valid.<#>NQ
I'm not looking for answers as hardcore as the one above (though they are useful and welcome) - in fact I would find answers that are achievable to be more attractive, as I'm looking for something to put into practice.<#>NQ
Answers would be most helpful if they addressed the following:<#>NQ
Maximize and multiple monitors<#>NQ
I write software for users with multiple monitors and I make design desicions based on the assumption that typically users will maximize windows to each monitor instead of "hand sizing" them.<#>NQ
Recently I have noticed though that there seems to be two "schools" in terms of using multiple monitors.<#>NQ
There is the "maximize" school and then there is the "size by hand" school which pretty much never maximizes.<#>NQ
Just curious, out of the multi-monitor users reading this, how many people maximize versus manually sizing?<#>NQ
I would be curious to know what platform you are on (Mac vs Windows vs *nix).<#>Q
Edit: I think this is a legitimate poll from a design perspective.<#>NQ
In the 13 years that Java has been around, are there any specific examples of backward incompatibilities?<#>Q
It has been thirteen years between the initial public release of Java 1.0 (1996) and the current stable release 1.6.0_16 (2009).<#>NQ
During those thirteen years the following notable releases have been made:<#>NQ
I'm looking for specific examples of backwards incompatibilities during the history of the Java platform. <#>NQ
What good build tools do you know for D?<#>Q
I wonder what build tools you know for D and in what state they are.<#>Q
Which language is better for general purpose programming, F# or Haskell?<#>Q
I'm currently learning Haskell, Which language (F# or Haskell) do you prefer for programming general purpose applications?<#>Q
Which do you think is the stronger language?<#>Q
Debugging techniques<#>NQ
Debugging is the most time consuming activity of programming.<#>NQ
So using appropriate tools and techniques is paramount to efficiency and productivity.<#>NQ
What are your favorite debugging techniques, and in which cases do you apply each of them?<#>Q
There are many orthogonal criteria to consider:<#>NQ
But I'm mainly interested on techniques (and tools, if there are any) which are generally applicable and that you find most useful for finding and squashing bugs.<#>NQ
The Pragmatic Bookshelf Effectiveness<#>NQ
I'm going to convince our managers to order Pragmatic Programmers bookshelf.<#>NQ
If I backup my idea with some success stories from you or your company, I think they'll listen more carefully :).<#>NQ
Or maybe vice versa: if you say it was total waste for you, I may give up with my intention.<#>NQ
Wanted to ask this question directly to Andy Hunt, but I have a gut feeling he will never see it among other 1K emails he receives daily.<#>NQ
PS: I'm not working for Andy or Dave.<#>NQ
I just know their books makes me more productive and successful :).<#>NQ
What's the best code generator you have used<#>Q
I recently took a look at MyGeneration, and I think it might be a great tool to use.<#>NQ
This was the first time I looked at a code Generator, and I would like to know about your experiences from other products, the pros, the cons and did you consider the tool usefull.<#>NQ
I will explain a bit how I plan to use it, so you might be able to answer more accurately to my question.<#>NQ
I create the tables in the database.<#>NQ
I am using Oracle and Visual Studio.<#>NQ
What CodeIgniter template library is best?<#>Q
As I see, there's a few Codeigniter template engines scattered all over the web, but unfortunately I can't recognize which is better in regard to: performance, features, maintenance ..etc<#>NQ
Some of those I've reached and seems to be mature:<#>NQ
Please help me decide which is better and why, detailed comparisons specially from those who already worked with some/any of these engines will be highly appreciated.<#>Q
Note that I'm not interested in standalone engines, only those created for Codeigniter.<#>NQ
PS: I'm very impressed with the long-detailed-comparisons posted for the other question "What Code Igniter authentication library is best?" here, and hope this one will be as much beneficial as that one.<#>Q
Is StringUtils.EMPTY recommended?<#>Q
Do you use StringUtils.EMPTY instead of ""?<#>Q
I mean as a return value or if you set a the value of a String variable.<#>NQ
I don't mean for comparison, because there we use StringUtils.isEmtpy()<#>NQ
Is there any way to identify a unique user in Flash/Actionscript 3?<#>Q
I'm trying to make a vote/poll application in Flash using Actionscript 3.<#>NQ
Is there any way to generate a specific ID that is unique to each user?<#>Q
The only other option I can think of is using the IP address, which is less than ideal in many cases (college campuses, shared Internet access, etc.).<#>NQ
It needs to be the same number every time it is run on the same PC, but different for each user.<#>NQ
Advanced MySQL: Find correlations between poll responses<#>NQ
I've got four MySQL tables:<#>NQ
Given a particular poll and a particular option, I'd like to generate a table that shows which options from other polls are most strongly correlated.<#>NQ
Suppose this is our data set:<#>NQ
Given the poll ID 1 and the option ID 2, the generated table should be something like this:<#>NQ
So basically, we're identifying all of the users who responded to poll ID 1 and selected option ID 2, and we're looking through all the other polls to see what percentage of them also selected each other option.<#>NQ
Most useful free third party Java libraries?<#>Q
I've never seen a good list of free Java libraries.<#>NQ
What are some of your can't-live-without Java libraries?<#>Q
Note: to keep this poll as useful as possible, please remember:<#>NQ
Prefered way to make a JavaScript Object<#>NQ
There are two ways (that I know of) to create a JavaScript object.<#>NQ
Which way do you prefer and why?<#>Q
I use the first method when I create my own objects because I find that it encapsulates the logic in a more readable fashion. <#>NQ
What programming language do you wish would catch on?<#>Q
For me it is these domain driven languages that are useful for creating micro languages in an environment, such as Boo.<#>NQ
Please state the reason why do you think so in your replies.<#>NQ
scenario / use case of where / when to do bit bitwise bit shift tricks tips question <#>NQ
I'm trying to learn the bitwise / shift / bit tricks...<#>NQ
many sites talks about the tricks / tips<#>NQ
some of the concept/tricks are very easy to grasp, e.g.<#>NQ
however, some tricks like counting bit set, I can't think of the scenario to use (sorry for inexperience).<#>NQ
would there be some nice reference to describe where to apply / use case?!<#>Q
I attached some very nice bit tricks here for sharing<#>NQ
Creating colored bars for poll results<#>NQ
In my web app I'd like to display poll results with colored bars with length proportional to the percentage of votes.<#>NQ
How can I achieve this with HTML/CSS?<#>Q
Technology stack for web app development<#>NQ
What technologies do you use for web application development?<#>Q
I'm presenting my approach and tools that I have been used as an example:<#>NQ
I have not been creating web apps for a few years now and I think I'm a bit behind from the state of the art.<#>NQ
Please share with your experience.<#>NQ
Create unique Poll/vote/survey in php<#>NQ
The unique poll/vote/survey i mean here is, user can only vote once.<#>NQ
How do i do that?<#>Q
Track their ip?<#>Q
Beside login, what else?<#>Q
login is my last option, thus beside login, is there anything else I can do?<#>Q
Funny/Interesting software limitations due to design choices<#>NQ
I'm interested in stories (factual, preferably on well-known systems) about funny or interesting ways in which certain design or implementation decisions constrained the software as it was experienced by users.<#>NQ
For example, in the funny comment threads someone mentioned that in the original Doom game, doors opened vertically because the maps were static so walls couldn't move horizontally.<#>NQ
Those sort of things. <#>NQ
How to get up to speed on SOA?<#>Q
I've been given the task of laying the groundwork of a SOA for my client.<#>NQ
The goal is to open up various processes in an end-client independent way and also to make data available offline e.g. for reps visiting customers.<#>NQ
I do have extensive experience with J2EE (Websphere) and web services but I would appreciate advice on how to build up such an SOA. <#>NQ
Where are the pitfalls?<#>Q
What about security?<#>Q
How finely granulated should services be?<#>Q
Links to tutorials and book recommendations would also be useful.<#>NQ
What kind of tasks demand scripting languages like Perl, Ruby, Python etc<#>Q
Can anyone please provide me some real world scenario where the scripting languages like Perl, Ruby, PHP are being used in a company that use Java/J2EE technlogies for their web/batch applications.<#>Q
I mean in which 'layer' these scripting languages are being used.<#>Q
I see lot of job postings which requires Java/J2ee + scripting skills.<#>NQ
I'm curious to know kind of "tasks" require scripting languages.<#>NQ
(I do use JavaScript for my Front-end (JSP) validations and Java for batch processing.<#>NQ
and sometime shell script(bash) for File management/Clean up activities.<#>NQ
Thanks for your time !<#>NQ
What would you like to find when inheriting a project?<#>Q
I put my two weeks in to find greener pastures.<#>NQ
Question though - What do I do with these two weeks?<#>Q
My users are still clamoring for new features, There are still bugs lurking around, production could be cleaner, and my bosses are politicking to figure out who, in a time of hiring freezes, is going to to maintain my project.<#>NQ
I've done most of my code with the idea of ensuring as little headache as possible for the next guy, so my code is as clean and readable as I could do.<#>NQ
Most of my library code is unit tested, although I don't have that much documentation out there.<#>NQ
What should I focus on for the next guy when I'm not sure who he/she will be?<#>Q
What would you, coming into a new project, find most helpful from your predecessor?<#>Q
A couple of notes that are project specific:<#>NQ
The code base is in a proprietary language that you've never heard of, because its not used anywhere.<#>NQ
It's like VB, and used for file to file transformations.<#>NQ
The documentation for this language is decent, although missing anything resembling a community. <#>NQ
Theres no unit testing framework out there for it.<#>NQ
I've hacked together a process to do testing, although it's not very deep.<#>NQ
(test case works/fails) Most of my reusable code has tests, although none of my process specific code does.<#>NQ
There is a very good chance that my code base will move to another department, so theres a good chance that no institutional knowledge will remain.<#>NQ
I'll be doing code reviews, but theres no guarantees that it will do any good.<#>NQ
We did not use version control - I kicked and screamed for it, but couldn't get any support.<#>NQ
Versoning/development is done in folders named with a ticket number stored on a network drive<#>NQ
We have a wiki - I'm unsure what kind of info to put on it.<#>NQ
I have some home rolled tools to make things easier for me.<#>NQ
The code is python and fairly clean - no testing or documentation for these (each tool is fairly straight forward)<#>NQ
The initial purpose of the project was to get off a database - there is no DB running as part of this project. <#>NQ
Worst example of you duplicating existing functionality?<#>Q
I've certainly done this : written a load of code to do some operation, then discovered that the language already had that functionality built in.<#>NQ
An early case i remember is writing a function to reverse a string in VB6, then stumbling across StrReverse a week later.<#>NQ
What's your worst example of this?<#>Q
Quick assist w/ finding Javascript variable (PollDaddy hash)<#>NQ
I'm working on finding a variable for a PollDaddy poll.<#>NQ
The API says that the hash is attributed to the variable PDV_h[PollID] (check "Voting" part of API).<#>NQ
I've been looking all around this poll here but can't seem to find it.<#>NQ
Can anyone help me figure out the hash and tell me how you were able to find it?<#>Q
What 8-bit embedded platform have you used for a design?<#>Q
I'm looking for an off-the-shelf 8-bit processor module or even an entire hardware platform you used in a design.<#>NQ
You used this product and essentially put your software on it.<#>NQ
If you could mention the processor type and vendor it would be great.<#>NQ
A small summary of the platform characteristics would also be great (e.g. 2 serial port, 1 10-base ethernet)<#>NQ
Think of this as an informal survey, so the actual capabilities of the platform don't really matter.<#>NQ
Edit: I'm really looking for off-the-shelf hardware modules, more than simply a processor.<#>NQ
Actual capabilities don't matter greatly, as this is more of a survey.<#>NQ
Recommended framework for Java Web Services<#>NQ
With an abundance of frameworks and stacks for Java Web Services (Axis2, Spring WS, CFX, Metro, ...), which one should be selected for new projects?<#>Q
What are the pros and cons for each one?<#>Q
How well have they worked for you?<#>Q
See related Q here<#>NQ
Good times: What was your most fun programming gig and why?<#>Q
In the umpteen years I've been in IT.<#>NQ
I come to the conclusion that most of the time management did not add a lot of value to my job as a programmer.<#>NQ
I even dare to say that most of them lacked vision, enthousiasm and a sense of direction.<#>NQ
All but one.<#>NQ
One manager I worked for had a vision and knew how to motivate a team.<#>NQ
We bypassed all protocol and secretly developed a system which he thought was lacking in our company.<#>NQ
We took a chance (and we could have all lost our jobs) but in the end it worked out nicely for all of us.<#>NQ
The tool we created (in a couple of months time) was well received and we got years of funding to improve the system.<#>NQ
Nobody even mentioned the fact that we wasted a lot of company resources and took a big risk.<#>NQ
That would be the most exiting programming gig for me.<#>NQ
What's yours?<#>Q
What is your favorite non-free Content Management System?<#>Q
I say "non-free" because I'd like to see what CMS tools are out there beyond the normal Drupal, Joomla or Wordpress debate.<#>NQ
Just your favorite!<#>NQ
What operating systems available for an 8-bit microprocessor?<#>Q
It does not need to be a full fledged OS, but at least have multitasking capabilities (i.e. a scheduler).<#>NQ
Please mention what processor architecture it works on.<#>NQ
This is a survey, so exact capabilities are not really important.<#>NQ
Think of this as being a place to look at for possibilities when your next 8-bit embedded project comes up...<#>NQ
I realize that most 8-bit micro do not require an OS, but just as a counter-example, Rabbit Semiconductor offers the RCM3710 processor module with 4 serial ports, a 10-BaseT ethernet port, 512K RAM and 512K Flash.<#>NQ
All that for $39.<#>NQ
All based around an 8-bit Z80 core.<#>NQ
8-bit does NOT necessarily mean extreme resource constraint.<#>NQ
What is the most painful development related mistake you have done and what you have learned?<#>Q
I guess mine was making a release to production on the development code which was not tested yet. <#>NQ
To what key did you redefine screen command key<#>Q
I'm using gnu screen in terminal and I'm quite happy with it.<#>NQ
The only thing is that I don't like the default command key binding ctrl+a.<#>NQ
I used it from the very beginning but now I understand that I would like to change it to something more comfortable for my hands.<#>NQ
There is no problem to change the hotkey, but I have a doubt what key to choose.<#>NQ
Please write down the key you have chosen to use as a command key in screen.<#>NQ
What could be the next evolution after OOP?<#>Q
Today we can look back on the evolution of computer science and see structural programming, functional programming, and finally object-oriented programming.<#>NQ
Additionally, things like meta-programming (reflective programming) and combining approaches into a single language (e.g. LINQ) are current.<#>NQ
Another trend is template-meta-programming (though implemented in C++ long ago) and the advent of dynamic languages (ruby, python).<#>NQ
What do you think<#>Q
What tasks do you use JavaScript for the most?<#>Q
What types of JavaScript scripts do find most useful in your work?<#>Q
Are there scripts that you wished were out there but just haven't been able to find?<#>Q
I'm trying to create a library of MooTools plugins and so I'm always looking for inspiration and advice.<#>NQ
I'm trying to concentrate on utility more than anything else, but any suggestions are okay.<#>NQ
I'm really not looking for code examples but rather descriptions of the tasks that you most often perform or would like to perform with JavaScript.<#>NQ
Using adaptive grammars<#>NQ
I'm trying to implement a language (or family of languages) whose grammar can be changed dynamically.<#>NQ
I have found no examples that serve as study cases.<#>NQ
Can you give me some reference to any that are actually used in the real world (even from the academic world)?<#>Q
Does it make sense to implement a Domain-Specific Languages with a dynamic grammar? <#>Q
What do you think?<#>Q
TDD Anti-patterns catalogue<#>NQ
anti-pattern : there must be at least two key elements present to formally distinguish an actual anti-pattern from a simple bad habit, bad practice, or bad idea:<#>NQ
Vote for the TDD anti-pattern that you have seen "in the wild" one time too many.<#>NQ
The blog post by James Carr and   Related discussion on testdrivendevelopment yahoogroup<#>NQ
If you've found an 'unnamed' one.. post them too.<#>NQ
One post per anti-pattern please to make the votes count for something.<#>NQ
My vested interest is to find the top-n subset so that I can discuss 'em in a lunchbox meet in the near future.<#>NQ
Are you using BizTalk?<#>Q
If so, how are you using it?<#>Q
At my last place of employment, I used BTS quite a bit.<#>NQ
However, I've noticed that managers often want to use it for the wrong things, and developers are hesitant to adopt it.<#>NQ
So, I'm just wondering, how's BTS being used?<#>Q
Please post experiences, not theories.<#>NQ
How Many Development Feeds Can you Follow?<#>Q
To all of you information addicts out there - I was wondering how much information can you take.<#>Q
At the moment I have 104 active subscriptions on my google reader, mostly development stuff, and I can barely keep up.<#>NQ
I do not really read all the stuff that gets posted - I scan with my eyes and if my fast forward algorithm gets some keyword I am interested in I go back and read.<#>NQ
What about you?<#>Q
How many Development feeds can you follow (assuming you get your day-job done)?<#>Q
User controls & Composite web server controls<#>NQ
Well Its both a poll and a question.<#>NQ
Which approach should i prefer when it comes to writing a custom control in ASP.Net.<#>Q
Should i create a custom User control or should I create a Composite Web Server control.<#>Q
And how about adding a Designer support to the composite control.<#>Q
How are they different from each other and their Pros and Cons.<#>Q
Difference with an example of each will be preferable.<#>NQ
What's Your Favorite C# Open Source Project of the year 2008?<#>Q
C#  Open Source Project Of The Year Award 2008<#>NQ
Let us decide which project should receive the honor, from the Stack Overflow community.<#>NQ
And as the best programming community, I think the community opinion matters. <#>NQ
What's the best Open Source Project you've found, and loved in 2008?<#>Q
List it here, and let the community vote for the same.<#>NQ
And in the end, we'll have a great list of interesting open source projects.<#>NQ
Your entry should have a brief description, and a link to download the source code.<#>NQ
You might consider entries from sites like Codeplex, Sourceforge.net, Codeproject etc. <#>NQ
Important: Please look in the existing list before posting your entry, if it is already there, just vote.<#>NQ
What is the best web based Subversion client?<#>Q
What is your favorite web-based svn client?<#>Q
I'd like one that supports commits via the web.<#>NQ
One tool per post please!<#>NQ
Please include platform and notable features (e.g. read-write support).<#>NQ
I'm referring to browser-based clients that users would go to like any other website--not accessing the repo via http.<#>NQ
What is your single favorite book or online resource for getting started with unit testing?<#>Q
I am looking for a book or online resource that gives a good overview of the subject, and is also practical for implementing unit testing.<#>NQ
The book should be useful for users of different programming languages.<#>NQ
SQL Server and Oracle, which one is better in terms of scalability?<#>Q
MS SQL Server and Oracle, which one is better in terms of scalability?<#>Q
For example, if the data size reach 500 TB etc.<#>NQ
What makes more sense - char* string or char *string?<#>Q
I'm learning C++ at the moment, and I'm coming across a lot of null-terminated strings.<#>NQ
This has got me thinking, what makes more sense when declaring pointers:<#>Q
To me, the char* format makes more sense, because the type of "string" is a pointer to a char, rather than a char.<#>NQ
However, I generally see the latter format.<#>NQ
This applies to references as well, obviously.<#>NQ
Could someone tell me if there is a logical reason for the latter format?<#>Q
Is using a CSS preprocessor language (SCSS or LESS) as useful as using a HTML preprocessor language (PHP)?<#>Q
In your opinion, the ability of nesting selectors, using variables, and other things in CSS is:<#>NQ
(You may select more than one option, and argumentation will be appreciated).<#>NQ
What got you started in programming?<#>Q
Why did you get into programming, and how old were you?<#>Q
It'd certainly be interesting to see the reasons for a large sample of programmers.<#>NQ
What are some Real-Time Operating Systems for 32-bit processors?<#>Q
What RTOS have you used or recommend for 32-bit processors.<#>Q
I'm interested in mainstream processors here: PowerPC, Pentium, ARM, MIPS<#>NQ
A link to a web site would be a nice bonus.<#>NQ
Let's conduct this as a poll.<#>NQ
Please only provide one selection per answer and mod up if you agree with a selection already present.<#>NQ
Use of else after a return or break from a function or loop<#>NQ
This is a matter of style I've considered for a while, and I'm curious of others thoughts.<#>NQ
The two pieces of code below are logically equivalent, which in your opinion is better style and why?<#>Q
Is anybody using twitter (or yammer or laconica) in their software development team?<#>Q
Would like to know your experience<#>NQ
I'd like to know about software development teams that use twitter (or yammer or laconica) in their process.<#>NQ
What are you reporting?<#>Q
Do you have automated tweet e.g. from build or test machine?<#>Q
Thanks a lot for your answer.<#>NQ
What tags do you use in the tasklist (e.g. Visual studio 2008)<#>Q
In our code, we currently use the following tags that can in turn be listed in the visual studio's tasklist:<#>NQ
TODO to mark tasks inside the code the need to be done<#>NQ
HACK to mark code that is only there to make something work for the moment, for instance for a presentation<#>NQ
REVIEW to mark a portion of code that has been reviewed and needs some editing<#>NQ
FIXED to mark REVIEW-codesegments that have been fixed, so that the reviewer can see that the appropriate changes have occurred.<#>NQ
What other tags do you use in your daily work?<#>Q
Do you think using tags (and the tasklist) is efficient enough for small teams (up to 10 people)?<#>Q
What other approaches do you use to directly comment on portions of code?<#>Q
Available Build Tools (make, etc)?<#>NQ
There's a lot of questions on here regarding various niche build needs (.NET, continuous integration, etc) but, of course, my niche need is different.<#>NQ
Rather than asking a very specific question right now, I'd like a survey of available build tools (such as make, ant, etc) so I can ask a follow up question more intelligently if needed.<#>NQ
In your answer, please include:<#>NQ
If your build tool is already in an answer, comment on it adding pros/cons/limitations/experiences.<#>NQ
Feel free to add as many answers as you like as long as they don't already exist - but don't put several build tools into one answer.<#>NQ
Please be aware that if you duplicate answers you may be downvoted - add additional information about a given build in the comments.<#>NQ
Ideally these comments will be incorporated into the answer over time.<#>NQ
How many lines of code do you average per bug?<#>Q
Our team had a bad session with the management today regarding the total number of functional bugs that were coming up in our code.<#>NQ
As for me, I have written around 6 K lines of code for this project and I am personally responsible for 4 functional bugs and 8 usability bugs (inconsistent CSS, page flashing on clicking a button, validation message spread accross two lines).<#>NQ
Is my average lines of code/bug too high?<#>Q
What's your average?<#>Q
Working on a SharePoint project with .NET 3.5.<#>NQ
How to implement a ilike Facebook system without user authentication and still prevent users from cheating?<#>Q
I am trying to implement something done in almost any website out there : a 'ilike' button (like Facebook) that does not require user authetication to be used for any article of my website written in Grails.<#>NQ
I don't want to use any external solution, so I need to implement it myself (or use a grails plugin).<#>NQ
So my question is : What does it take to implement this 'ilike' button and prevent users from cheating at the maximum?<#>Q
For instance, do I need to store local cookies (I suppose yes)?<#>Q
Do I need to check the session ID and IP of the HTTP request?<#>Q
What are the well-known implementations for online polls for instance?<#>Q
Thank you very much for your help.<#>NQ
What are some examples of exceptional C++ open-source code?<#>Q
The best way to learn is by practicing, but it's always good to learn from others who are smarter than you.<#>NQ
What is the best example of a well-designed, well coded open-source project?<#>Q
I'm specifically interested in C++ projects, but other exceptional examples would be welcome, as well.<#>NQ
LINQBridge users: is it feature-complete?<#>Q
For desktop programmers, do you avoid deploying .NET 3.5 framework on client machines for its big footprint?<#>Q
.NET 3.5 Framework evokes a feeling of OLE 2.0 (aka COM).<#>NQ
When 2.0 newly came out, some users then are asking if there will be OLE version 3.0.<#>NQ
But there will be none.<#>NQ
OLE 2.0 is a solid architecture where all future improvements can be made without touching the underlying architecture.  <#>NQ
I think the same of .NET Framework 2.0's CLR as a solid architecture, which there will be no need to change the underlying architecture to accomodate future improvements.<#>NQ
.NET 3.5 was shipped without needing to change its underlying CLR(2.0).<#>NQ
If Microsoft can improve .NET (5.0) without making changes to underlying architecture (CLR 2.0), it is a proof that CLR 2.0 has a sound foundation right from the start, kudos to them.<#>NQ
The same cannot be said of JVM, its foundation is flawed.<#>NQ
Their generics cannot get first-class support from its VM/CLR.<#>NQ
That being said, .NET 3.5 is just extra libraries, where some functionalities I don't need, some I can happily swapped with(e.g. LINQBridge).<#>NQ
The rest are just syntactic sugars(doesn't depend on 3.5).<#>NQ
Can still continue using VS 2008, targeting .NET 2.0 (only 20 MB), yet can still get the neat features: lambda,extension methods,inferred variable,anonymous types,automatic properties,etc.<#>NQ
Do you know of any programs worth reading?<#>Q
One of the top tips for new programmers is to read programs, like the "old masters" who studied paintings of their ancestors, all programmers should also study programs of their colleagues.<#>NQ
The question is, which programs are worth the trouble?  <#>Q
What is the most difficult UnitTest case you have ever encountered?<#>Q
One of the most difficult test cases I have encountered is testing features that operates on files and folders.<#>NQ
It is not easy to mock or simulate files and folders.<#>NQ
What are the most useful data structures to know inside out?<#>Q
I'm interested in finding out what people would consider the most useful data structures to know in programming.<#>NQ
What data structure do you find yourself using all the time? <#>Q
Answers to this post should help new programmers interested in finding a useful data structure for their problem.<#>NQ
Answers should probably include the data structure, information about it or a relevant link, the situation it is being used in and why it is a good choice for this problem (e.g ideal computation complexities, simplicity and understanding etc.<#>NQ
Each answer should be about one data structure only.<#>NQ
Thanks for any pearls of wisdom and experience people can share.<#>NQ
Poll of techniques used by SO developers to estimate the effort or time for a project or task<#>NQ
There has been quite a bit of discussion about how to apply specific estimation techniques, or which estimation method is better than others.<#>NQ
But it's hard to get a sense of which estimation practices people actually use.<#>NQ
What I am interested in is an informal poll of what types of estimation techniques people typically use. <#>NQ
Please add or upvote those techniques that you find you commonly use when estimating projects or work - the idea is that the most popular techniques would float to the top.<#>NQ
Please look over the techniques listed before adding your own.<#>NQ
Please don't down vote techniques that you don't like or don't practice - the idea here is to get a sense of which techniques are popular or commonly used by people.<#>NQ
If you have opinions about specific techniques or thoughts about how you apply them, please add them to the comments for an item.<#>NQ
Pros and Cons regarding extended use of branches<#>NQ
I want to be able to choose the right branching strategy for most thinkable situations and organizations.<#>NQ
So I'm looking for a extensive list of positive and negative effects of extending the use of code repository branches in a development organization. <#>NQ
Please only post one pro or one con in each post, so that the voting system can help rank the feedback somewhat.<#>NQ
What to use for an Agile sprint/iteration calendar?<#>Q
So where I work we approach our projects using Scrum.<#>NQ
Recently we have all been bumping heads and interrupting each others work too frequently because of competing role interests (developers, QA, product owners, scrum masters, business analysts...) <#>NQ
In order to fix this we want to implement a sprint "cadence" where blocks of time are designated to do specific types of work.<#>NQ
What I would like to know is if anybody else is doing this, and if so what tools are you using to make this highly visible and available to the rest of the team? <#>Q
I know I could use a shared calendar in Outlook, but the idea is to have every hour during the day go towards something.<#>Q
Using outlook events for this is pretty cumbersome, doesn't allow for flexibiltiy, and wasn't designed to be implemented for "uneven" time periods (tuesday week 1, thursday week 2, etc...)<#>NQ
Do people use the additivity feature of log4j a lot.<#>Q
I personally haven't found that being too useful to log the same thing in multiple places and often have ended up setting additivity=false. <#>NQ
What are the use-cases where people find additivity to be a great feature ?<#>Q
Tools for automatically generating unit tests for C++?<#>Q
We have a large amount of legacy C++ code in shared libraries that are used on dozens of products.<#>NQ
Ignoring the pros and cons of automatically generating tests (that's a discussion for another day), does anyone have any recommendations for a tool that would analyse the source and generate a set of tests to exercise that code?<#>Q
Ideally it would be a Windows tool, Linux might be okay if absolutely necessary.<#>NQ
What's the most feature rich text editor on Linux for Ruby on Rails development?<#>Q
What text editor do you think is the most feature rich for Ruby on Rails development on Linux?<#>Q
I'm also open to IDEs.<#>NQ
What's the most unsound program you've had to maintain?<#>Q
I periodically am called upon to do maintenance work on a system that was built by a real rocket surgeon.<#>NQ
There's so much wrong with it that it's hard to know where to start.  <#>NQ
No, wait, I'll start at the beginning:  in the early days of the project, the designer was told that the system would need to scale, and he'd read that a source of scalability problems was traffic between the application and database servers, so he made sure to minimize this traffic.<#>NQ
By putting all of the application logic in SQL Server stored procedures.<#>NQ
The great bulk of the application functions by the HTML front end formulating XML messages.<#>NQ
When the middle tier receives an XML message, it uses the document element's tag name as the name of the stored procedure it should call, and calls the SP, passing it the entire XML message as a parameter.<#>NQ
It takes the XML message that the SP returns and returns it directly back to the front end.<#>NQ
There is no other logic in the application tier.<#>NQ
There was some code in the middle tier to validate the incoming XML messages against a library of schemas.<#>NQ
But I removed it, after ascertaining that 1) only a small handful of messages had corresponding schemas, 2) the messages didn't actually conform to these schemas, and 3) after validating the messages, if any errors were encountered, the method discarded them.<#>NQ
"This fuse box is a real time-saver - it comes from the factory with pennies pre-installed!<#>NQ
I've seen software that does the wrong thing before.<#>NQ
Lots of it.<#>NQ
I've written quite a bit.<#>NQ
But I've never seen anything like the steely-eyed determination to do the wrong thing, at every possible turn, that's embodied in the design and programming of this system.<#>NQ
Well, at least he went with what he knew, right?<#>NQ
Apparently, what he knew was Access.<#>NQ
And he didn't really understand Access.<#>NQ
Here's a common pattern in this code:<#>NQ
Okay, fine.<#>NQ
You don't trust the query optimizer either.<#>NQ
But how about this?<#>Q
Originally, I was going to post this in What's the best comment in source code you have ever encountered?<#>Q
but I realized that there was so much more to write about than just this one comment, and things just got out of hand.<#>NQ
At the end of many of the utility stored procedures, you'll see code that looks like the following:<#>NQ
Yes, that code is doing exactly what you can't allow yourself to believe it's doing lest you be driven mad.<#>NQ
If the variable contains a NULL, he's alerting the caller by changing its value to -9999.<#>NQ
Here's how this number is commonly used:<#>NQ
For another dimension of this system, see the article on thedailywtf.com entitled I Think I'll Call Them "Transactions".<#>NQ
I'm not making any of this up.<#>NQ
I'm often reminded, when I work on this system, of Wolfgang Pauli's famous response to a student:  "That isn't right.<#>NQ
It isn't even wrong.<#>NQ
This can't really be the very worst program ever.<#>NQ
It's definitely the worst one I've worked<#>NQ
what are the most common problems you encounter in freelance web development?<#>Q
im wanting to write a paper on the most common problems encountered during freelance web development.<#>NQ
i thought i'd consult with you chaps since it never ceases to blow my mind how good the suggestions/input is that comes from the people on this forum.<#>NQ
let me start by listing the things i have encountered over the years (nb. i've been doing freelance web dev for about 5-6 years now).<#>NQ
what other things have you guys found?<#>Q
and also, what strategies do you use to get around them?<#>Q
Opinion Poll on Unnamed Structs<#>NQ
Having a bit of internal debate in my group about the use of unnamed structs\unions in our C++ code.<#>NQ
I'd like to get feedback from the community of what you think.<#>NQ
Should they be used at all?<#>Q
When is it valuable?<#>Q
What are the pitfalls?<#>Q
Edit:  also consider if the original structure was defined without the union and that was added at a later point in time.<#>NQ
How often do you view multiple sources files at the same time in Eclipse?<#>Q
I'm writing a plug-in for Eclipse that decorates things in a Java source editor.<#>NQ
I have to decide whether to make the extra effort (and pay a performance/memory cost) to place the annotations on every visible source file in the editor, or just support one active file at a time. <#>NQ
I know that in my experience, I rarely ever have two source files visible at the same time within the same workbench window.<#>NQ
Note that I am talking about two source files visible at the same time, not one file visible and a whole bunch of others hidden as tabs.<#>NQ
I'm wondering what other people's usage pattern is.<#>Q
Note: this is community-wikid. <#>NQ
.NET best practices?<#>NQ
I know it is a broad topic but I'm interested in any of .NET's so-called best practices, though I'm looking for less obvious ones, unlike "use as instead of casting".<#>NQ
Let's see what interesting things I can learn from Stack Overflow users.<#>NQ
How do you name your filter methods?<#>Q
Do you use "By" or "With"?<#>Q
I am working on a library that will contain many filter methods.<#>NQ
I have seen many project that use this syntax for filters<#>NQ
In other project people use this syntax<#>NQ
Since this library will be reused by many other developers I wanted to know which one developers feel more comfortable with.<#>NQ
Please let me know which you prefer and if possible why.<#>Q
The first few answers suggest just overloading a GetFoo method to accept various arguments.<#>NQ
This works well for a standard interface in a language that supports overloading.<#>NQ
But in my case some I will also have some more fluent apis so I will want to link various filters like this<#>NQ
Which development environment for HTML5 to choose<#>Q
What editor?<#>Q
What primary browser?<#>Q
What about debugging?<#>Q
What is the best back-end?<#>Q
What are some examples of Windows desktop applications with beautiful GUIs?<#>Q
This is a subjective question.<#>NQ
For those who are Windows developers coding desktop applications, what are the most beautiful or nice looking GUI you have ever seen or built?<#>Q
Why am I asking this?<#>Q
I'm looking for good models to follow.<#>NQ
What are your favorite programming magazines?<#>Q
At my desk I usually have 2 or 3 magazines sitting around to look at when I take a break or want to refer to something.<#>NQ
On my desk currently is 2600 Magazine, Linux Journal and Cooks Illustrated (cooking and programming are remarkably similar)<#>NQ
So what do you read?<#>Q
SOA - What Internal Web Service Did Your Company Implement First?<#>Q
What internal web service did your company implement first?<#>Q
What did you learn?<#>Q
Recursive Make - friend or foe?<#>Q
I'm using (GNU) Make in my project.<#>NQ
I'm currently putting one makefile per directory and specify the subdirectories using SUBDIRS.<#>NQ
It's been suggested to me that this is not the ideal way of using make, that using a one toplevel make file (or several, split up using include).<#>NQ
I've tried migrating/using this layout in the past, but it appears to me that it's unnecessary complicated.<#>NQ
Which are the benefits/drawbacks of using recursive makefiles?<#>Q
What is a way for a web browser to communicate with a hardware device?<#>Q
I have a data acquisition hardware device attached to a PC via USB that I'd like to send some information and settings, acquire some data, and then retrieve the acquired data on the client and send it to the server.<#>NQ
The plan is to use a web portal to communicate with the device attached to the client PC.<#>NQ
I was planning on writing a DLL to talk to the device.<#>NQ
My environment on the client is Windows using IE as the browser.<#>NQ
The server side is Windows or Linux.<#>NQ
What is the best way to communicate from a web browser client to a client-side device?<#>Q
Clarification: The first goal is to allow the client PC to send acquisition settings to the device.<#>NQ
The settings may be manually entered at the client or may come from the server.<#>NQ
The second goal is to get the acquired data to the server's database.<#>NQ
I don't need to display the acquired data at the client.<#>NQ
The hardware device has a CPU but very limited memory.<#>NQ
The protocol to communicate with the device is undetermined but I may access the device like a USB drive.<#>NQ
Please respond with one method per answer so people can vote on indenpendent answers.<#>NQ
As with all StackOverflow Poll type Q&amp;As, please make certain your answer is NOT listed already before adding a new answer<#>NQ
What are the most important parts of the .NET framework for a beginner?<#>Q
You often see, on sites like The Daily WTF, examples of overengineered code that should have just been a call to a built-in method within the .NET framework.<#>NQ
What namespaces/classes should be considered essential knowledge for a developer starting his/her first .NET job?<#>Q
As per Joel Spolsky's instruction for these types of questions, please limit your answers to individual items for voting purposes.<#>NQ
How can I prove IP rotation is being used to cheat in public voting?<#>Q
I am running an anonymous voting contest.<#>NQ
We are using cookies as the sole deterrant of multiple voting, but also tracking IP addresses and looking for suspiciously high numbers of votes from the same IP.<#>NQ
Is there any way toprovethat someone is cheating by IP rotation?<#>Q
What new features in java 7 do you find most useful?<#>Q
From this thread New features in java 7 I found the new features in java from Alex Miller list<#>NQ
Which ones do you find most useful and why?<#>Q
Which ones will be counterproducent?<#>Q
NOTE this list is not final and not all of them will make it through.<#>NQ
Do you write your unit tests first, after a bit of coding or not at all?<#>Q
I was wondering when most people wrote their unit tests, if at all.<#>Q
I usually write tests after writing my initial code to make sure it works like its supposed to.<#>NQ
I then fix what is broken.<#>NQ
I have been pretty successful with this method but have been wondering if maybe switching to writing the test first would be advantageous.<#>NQ
Typical pitfalls of cross-browser compatibility<#>NQ
What are the most common browser compatibility issues across the major desktop browsers?<#>Q
No dups please.<#>NQ
Up-vote problems you've run into.<#>NQ
I'm hoping for the list to self-sort.<#>NQ
"IE sux" is not a pitfall, but a call for down-vote.<#>NQ
[Edit] Yes, I know it's a poll - I'm not posting answers in this to gather points - I'm actually interested in knowing what people typically run into.<#>NQ
Example of code generator you made from scratch?<#>Q
What are some examples of code generators you have used?<#>Q
I think it's a cool idea, but I have trouble thinking of things they can do besides make a class based on an object's attributes/database schema (as described in The Pragmatic Programmer).<#>NQ
What language did you write them in and what language did they output?<#>Q
Edit: Thanks for the responses so far.<#>NQ
What I am really looking for is examples of code generators made from scratch for some certain purpose.<#>NQ
I mentioned it in the title, but didn't make it very clear in my question.<#>NQ
How did you go about making a code generator on your own and what specificly did it achieve?<#>Q
Which certifications have helped you and what specifically about them have helped you the most?<#>Q
With so many certifications for everything, I was curious to know what certifications that you have or are currently in the process of getting that have helped you in your career.<#>Q
I am mainly looking for programming certifications, but all are welcome.<#>NQ
Platform for ad-supported shareware<#>NQ
I'm working on a little piece of rich client software that I'd like to distribute for free.<#>NQ
That is, I'd still like to make money on it, but I'd like the revenue to come from advertising.<#>NQ
Do you know of an advertising platform that works well for client apps?<#>Q
I'd like the ads to be completely unobtrusive (like Google AdSense is for websites).<#>NQ
I'd hate to have any kind of popups or other horrible UX.<#>NQ
I just want a tiny little ad in the corner of my addin.<#>NQ
It would be great if ads could be contextual (i.e. if the platform had an API to tell it what the user is looking at the current moment - give some keywords - to show the most relevant ads).<#>NQ
Any thoughts/ideas?<#>Q
Emacs keybinding hall of fame/shame<#>NQ
What are the best and worst emacs key bindings in development software?<#>Q
Ever since I learned it, I find myself trying to use C-p and C-n to move up and down in everything that has a text box on it.<#>NQ
I'm perpetually annoyed by software that has an emacs mode that's pretty obviously either put together by someone who's never used emacs before or it's done in a crappy manner.<#>NQ
So let's recognize the winners and losers in this thread.<#>NQ
Do stackoverflow users agree with the CWE/SANS Top 25 most dangerous programming mistakes?<#>Q
Report released today on the "top 25" most dangerous programming mistakes.<#>NQ
I'm interested to see if any here agree or can spot any glaring omissions (or outdated inclusions). <#>NQ
Also, in your opinion which modern dev tools/frameworks are improving (or worsening) these flaws for things like authorization, SQL injection, or code injection?<#>Q
Favorite discussion forums for Android?<#>NQ
What are your favorite discussion forums for Android issues?<#>Q
StackOverflow is Google's recommended go-to site for beginner questions but the way it's structured is best for simple questions with simple, black-and-white answers.<#>NQ
StackOverflow isn't really structured for an extended discussion where someone says "Try This" , so I post back and say "OK, I tried that, here's a screen shot of what I got" and someone else responds to that, etc.<#>NQ
So are there other high-quality, active Android developer forums?<#>Q
When I Googled for some the ones I found were low traffic - people posting questions and a week later had no responses.<#>NQ
What’s Your Favorite Feature in Ruby?<#>Q
Similar questions have been asked for .NET and Java, but not for Ruby.<#>NQ
So, what’s your favorite feature in Ruby?<#>Q
You might also be interested in hidden features of Ruby.<#>NQ
Please be specific and post one feature per answer.<#>NQ
An explanation or a code sample would be nice.<#>NQ
What application do you use to synchronize work directory with ftp directory?<#>Q
I'd like to poll this question: What application do you use to synchronize the working directory at local PC and remote directory (via FTP)?<#>NQ
I'm kind of bored of using FTP client to transfer each file I edit all the time.<#>NQ
Fullstack or Glue web framework?<#>Q
Working in web development we see numerous amount of web frameworks growing everyday.<#>NQ
We also see people comparing framework X vs framework Y.<#>NQ
But technically they all boil down to two types: fullstack or just a glue webframework.<#>NQ
A fullstack web framework is a web framework that offers front to back framework.<#>NQ
Django and RIFE can bee seen as a framework of this type, where it has its own templating language and ORM.<#>NQ
On the other hand, a glue webframework is a framework that just acts as a glue to the other different components and leave the decision to  developer to pick the ORM, templating, etc.<#>NQ
Pylons and Spring framework can fall under this type.<#>NQ
So, the question is: as a developer, would you prefer choosing a fullstack framework or just a glue framework and then choose the ORM and templating by yourself?<#>Q
Which JMS implementation do you use?<#>Q
We are using ActiveMQ 5.2 as our implementation of choice and we picked it a while ago.<#>NQ
It performs well enough for our use right now.<#>NQ
Since its been a while, I was wondering what other Java Message Service implementations are in use and why?<#>Q
Surely there are more than a few.<#>NQ
Platform for ad-supported shareware<#>NQ
Any thoughts/ideas?<#>Q
What are the advantages and disadvantages of GPGPU (general-purpose GPU) development?<#>Q
I am wondering what is the key thing that helps you in GPGPU development and of course what is the constraints that you find unacceptable.<#>NQ
Comes to mind for me:<#>NQ
What's your view?<#>Q
What is your .NET logging framework of choice?<#>Q
There are many Logging frameworks for .NET, from simple Debug.WriteLine and Trace to Log4Net, Logging application block, NLOg and others.<#>NQ
Which one do you use or recommend, and why?<#>Q
Also, which one would you recommend to NOT use, and why?<#>Q
Are we in a functional programming fad?<#>Q
I use both functional and imperative languages daily, and it's rather amusing to see the surge of adoption of functional languages from both sides of the fence.<#>NQ
It strikes me, however, that it looks rather like a fad.<#>NQ
Do you think that it's a fad?<#>Q
I know the reasons for using functional languages at times and imperative languages in others, but do you really think that this trend will continue due to the cliched "many-core" revolution that has been only "18 months from now" since 2004 (sort of like communism's Radiant Future), or do you think that it's only temporary; a fascination of the mainstream developer that will be quickly replaced by the next shiny idea, like Web 3.0 or GPGPU?<#>Q
Note, that I'm not trying to start a flamewar or anything (sorry if it sounds bitter), I'm just curious as to whether people will think functional or functional/imperative languages will become mainstream.<#>NQ
Edit: By mainstream, I mean, equal number of programmers to say, Python, Java, C#, etc<#>NQ
What features to implement in a version control system?<#>Q
I will be implementing a version control system in C++ for my final year project.<#>NQ
I would like to know:<#>NQ
Thanx a ton,<#>NQ
Hibernate Gotchas<#>NQ
What are certain rules of thumb you have learnt while working on Hibernate.<#>NQ
As Hibernate is mostly about mappings (or may be I find that the hardest part), could you please share some best practices that were helpful to you in proper mappings of table relationships.<#>NQ
For example, when to map using "join" and when not, when would you be "eager" or "lazy" etc.<#>Q
Any other advice/experiences are also welcome as how you improved performance (with or without caching) and avoided some common pitfalls.<#>NQ
Motive is to go through some real life experiences that inspire and help faster learning of important (practical) aspects of Hibernate.<#>NQ
What code analysis tools do you use for your Java projects?<#>Q
I am interested in all kinds<#>NQ
If applicable, also state what build tools you use and how well these tools integrate with both your IDEs and build tools. <#>Q
If a tool is only available a specific way (as an IDE plugin, or, say, a build tool plugin) that information is also worth noting.<#>NQ
Django Admin app or roll my own?<#>Q
I'm just starting to use Django for a personal project.<#>NQ
What are the pros and cons of using the built-in Admin application versus integrating my administrative functions into the app itself (by checking request.user.is_staff)?<#>Q
This is a community wiki because it could be considered a poll.<#>NQ
What programming language should I choose for an independent study language?<#>Q
I am a senior computer science major and I am required to do a self study on a specific language of my choice.<#>NQ
I am currently familiar with C++, Java, VB, PHP, and Silverlight.<#>NQ
I would not consider myself a master of any of these languages but I have a functioning knowledge.<#>NQ
Should I keep broadening my knowledge of different languages or work on mastering a specific language?<#>Q
What convention do you use for backup file names?<#>Q
What convention do you use, or what conventions have you seen in other programs?<#>Q
(It's for a research project)<#>NQ
What debug logging tools are available from Javascript?<#>Q
I'd like to create a "universal" debug logging function that inspects the JS namespace for well-known logging libraries.<#>NQ
For example, currently it supports Firebug's console.log:<#>NQ
Obviously, this only works in Firefox if Firebug is installed/enabled (it'll also work on other browsers with Firebug Lite).<#>NQ
Basically, I will be providing a JS library which I don't know what environment it will be pulled into, and I'd like to be able to figure out if there is a way to report debug output to the user.<#>NQ
So, perhaps jQuery provides something - I'd check that jQuery is present and use it.<#>NQ
Or maybe there are well-known IE plugins that work that I can sniff for.<#>NQ
But it has to be a fairly well-established and used mechanism.<#>NQ
I can't check for every obscure log function that people create.<#>NQ
Please, only one library/technology per answer, so they can get vote-ranked.<#>NQ
Also, using alert() is a good short-term solution but breaks down if you want robust debug logging or if blocking the execution is a problem.<#>NQ
Best IDE for Ruby on Rails<#>NQ
Having moved from Java to Ruby, I am struggling to find a good IDE for Ruby.<#>NQ
I used Eclipse on Java, so I tried Aptana Studio (previously Radrails), but it's not even half as good.<#>NQ
Currently I am trying out NetBeans for Ruby.<#>NQ
Please suggest me the best Ruby on Rails IDE out there.<#>NQ
I believe TextMate is universally accepted as the best editor on Mac OS X. I am looking for Windows.<#>NQ
So far it seems NetBeans and E Text Editor are worth a try.<#>NQ
Patterns to mix F# and C# in the same solution<#>NQ
I studied few functional languages, mostly for academical purposes.<#>NQ
Nevertheless, when I have to project a client-server application I always start adopting a Domain Driven Design, strictly oop.<#>NQ
A complex solution written in a .Net framework could get advantages using more than a language and sometimes more than a paradigm.<#>NQ
Mixing C or C++  with LUA or Python is a common practice, sometimes embedding prolog can be very interesting.<#>NQ
I never tried to mix OOP and functional paradigm.<#>NQ
F# is a newer functional and object oriented language, I see that's it's technically very easy to mix C# with F# libraries in the same solution.<#>NQ
But I wonder if it makes any sense: I use Linq to satisfy many of my functional requirements.<#>NQ
When and how, do you think it's a good idea to mix these two languages together?<#>Q
I wonder if exists a set of patterns that tries that.<#>NQ
Do you actually use F# in a C# solution?<#>Q
What do you use to make programming flowcharts, diagrams, etc?<#>Q
I've always just used OpenOffice Draw and it just occurred to me that there has to be something better out there. <#>NQ
So what do you use?<#>Q
Do you like it? <#>Q
Bonus points for free things and for web apps. <#>NQ
What features would you like to see in Java?<#>Q
This is a pretty unoriginal question!<#>NQ
Where do you stand on the Closures Proposal?<#>Q
What else would you want to see?<#>Q
For me it has to be a new decimal type which is really a BigDecimal but allows for standard math operations using +, -, x, / etc.<#>NQ
Examples solicited: who is using C# for anything besides Windows front ends?<#>Q
As an outgrowth of "Why should I learn C++ rather than C# question, here is a poll: who is using C# for things that are not related to Windows GUI?<#>Q
Web programming qualifies, even if I think it's borderline.<#>NQ
Ideal example would be a back-end application where you chose C# specifically because of its language features, and not because that's the only thing used at your shop.<#>NQ
Good HTML/Javascript Poll Widgets<#>NQ
Facebook and Twitter have some cool widgets (share, comments, etc. ) but I can not find similar poll widgets.<#>NQ
What simple, customizable, and free poll widgets are there?<#>Q
Where are all the Delphi Developers?<#>Q
Stack Overflow has a pretty good Delphi community.<#>NQ
I am curious however where else Delphi developers are hanging out.<#>NQ
I am looking for programming related community sites.  <#>NQ
Obviously Forums.CodeGear.com is a popular place.<#>NQ
Where else?  <#>Q
One of the reasons I ask is I was looking at Refactor My Code and noticed there is no Delphi category.<#>NQ
Is it worth asking them to add one?<#>Q
Would any other Delphi developers contribute?  <#>Q
Best technical shibboleths and keywords<#>NQ
In natural language research and anthropology there is the construction known as a Shibboleth.<#>NQ
Specifically this is defined as when your pronunciation of a word gives away your cultural background. <#>NQ
This isn't just your favourite piece of hi-tech argot, but that favourite thing that lusers will say wrong and you'll know them for the n00b they are?   <#>NQ
What do you think of PHP's new namespace separator?<#>Q
PHP 5.3 (alpha) has had namespace support for a while using '::' as a separator.<#>NQ
But due to some problems with ambiguity with this separator, the PHP team has decided on '\'.<#>NQ
From a recent story on Slashdot:<#>NQ
Who else thinks '\' is one of the worst separators?<#>Q
'\' is almost universally accepted as an escape character, but besides that it just looks unnatural.<#>NQ
Feedback on Eclipse Equinox - OSGi Framework<#>NQ
I'm looking for toward evolving my app to use an OSGi framework.<#>NQ
Eclipse Equinox appears to be a good choice as implementation... and I'm interrested by the Virgo server. <#>NQ
But what do you think of this implementation?<#>Q
Have you ever used it?<#>Q
Pain or gain?<#>Q
Hidden (or not widely known) features of jQuery<#>NQ
What are the hidden features of jQuery?<#>Q
See also: Hidden features of javascript<#>NQ
Developers, do you have a home server (cluster) running 24x7?<#>Q
If yes, what's the hardware and software configuration (CPU/memory/disk/OS/server software etc.<#>NQ
What kind of services the server provides (file sharing,backup,DB/Web/Streaming server,CVS/SVN server etc.<#>NQ
Which version of C# (and .Net) should I begin with?<#>Q
I'm trying to bring myself up to speed on C#, having never developed for it before.<#>NQ
In a previous question I asked about good book review sites, and through that I found a very positive (beginner-oriented) review for "Essential C#" but it was for a previous edition.<#>NQ
While I'm sure that it will still be a good book even if the quality dropped between versions, it raises an interesting question for me:<#>NQ
When beginning a new language, is it best to start with the latest version (e.g. C# 3.0/.Net 3.5) or should I go back a version or two and try to learn what got added to the language afterward?<#>Q
The former seems better from the point of view of being up to date immediately, but the latter seems more pragmatic in that it's probably more likely a shop will be using a slightly older version of the language.<#>NQ
Which is this facebook poll application?<#>Q
Can anyone please tell how to add the following kind of poll in a facebook business page...<#>NQ
It shows in the wall as well as in its own tab..<#>NQ
I can vote from the wall, comment and Like.. excellent feature it is.. but no information about it anywhere :(<#>NQ
What is the value of BPM?<#>Q
(Business Process management) Is it worth using?<#>Q
In which cases?<#>Q
And I'm not meaning Bits Per Minute, but Business Process Management. <#>NQ
At first though BPM was overestimated, because the technology is somehow easy to address, but I've learned the value of BPM suites is in involving the non-technical, the business experts into the software design. <#>NQ
I know, the user is always with us during analysis, but the artifacts we use are always very  unfamiliar to them.<#>NQ
No matter how friendly the UML diagram looks like, or how many Agile iterations we go into,  there is always a gap between the final user and the final developer ( usually covered by the user manager and the IT manager  :-S   ) <#>NQ
How do you ( as software developers ) see BPM?<#>Q
Does it looks interesting?<#>Q
Would you consider to learn one of them?<#>Q
Do your think in 5 yrs it will be dead?  <#>Q
I know BPM is not silver bullet at all, but unless you have a very smart customer who knows how to express their requirements for us to get it right, the analysis and requirements will always be the area where the projects will fail.<#>NQ
Selecting multiple radio buttons (through jquery, javasscript?<#>Q
I currently have a form with lets say 5 radio button entries (see below).<#>NQ
What im looking archive is the following:<#>NQ
- Being able to choose multiple radio buttons - lets say 3 and submit the form.<#>NQ
Currently I got it working fine with PHP, SQL, but im only able to choose one radiobutton and submit that.<#>NQ
I figure it would also come in handy being able to deselect a radio button in case you wrongly click one.<#>NQ
My guess is that this can be done through some javascript?<#>Q
Any suggestions?<#>Q
Online examples perhaps?<#>Q
How often do you reevaluate and upgrade your development environment and dev.<#>Q
I was curious how often other software developers reevaluated their development environments and tools.<#>Q
I used to work at a large corporation with rigid toolsets that everyone hated, but could do nothing about.<#>NQ
So nobody ever really updated their development environments because we couldn't in that environment.<#>NQ
Now that I'm in my own start-up I find I can spend endless time evaluating new tools and development environments, but that I really shouldn't and can't afford to.<#>NQ
I've committed to spending 1 day a month looking at new development tools and trying them out to see if it is worth switching.  <#>NQ
How often do you try out new IDE's, editors, bug tacking tools, debuggers?<#>Q
Or update to newer versions of your own?<#>Q
What's the best way to organize CSS rules?<#>Q
What strategies help you keep track of a large number of CSS rules?<#>Q
How do you organize your files, your code blocks, and your rules?<#>Q
How do you deal with micromanagers?<#>Q
In the past I've worked with several types of project managers.<#>NQ
There's the laissez-faire PM who stays ignorant of the process as long as milestones are hit.<#>NQ
There's the hands on PM who gets into the innards of the process and tries to block and tackle, removing obstacles.  <#>NQ
And then there's the micromanager.<#>NQ
I've had a horrible success rate in working with micromanagers.<#>NQ
The successes I've had have been with micromanagers who wish to learn what's going on so they can better explain it up the chain.<#>NQ
The failures have been with micromanagers who don't understand the process, and don't want to understand.<#>NQ
They seem to have an implicit distrust of the technology or the resources behind it and want every task broken down into bite size pieces that they can understand.<#>NQ
In my case, it's meant that stuff which is not "visible", creating an API, extending a framework, etc, is not a "task", but displaying a button on a page is.<#>NQ
I think I'm not the only one who has dealt with micromanagers such as this.<#>NQ
What strategies have you used to have success in these situations?<#>Q
Why is the german keyboard layout so cumbersome for programming?<#>Q
When you have a german keyboard layout: do you switch for programming sessions?<#>Q
Do you actually use a webbased IDE and why?<#>Q
Do you use a webbased IDE? <#>Q
Why and what is your experience?<#>Q
REST Url for Lists<#>NQ
Let's say I have a method that returns a list of customers and as input has a list of states and list of sizes, something like<#>NQ
return customers where state in (NY, CA, TX) and size in (Small, Medium)<#>NQ
What would the best RESTFul URL that I should use?<#>Q
The problem that it is a query and does not point to a specific 'resource'.<#>NQ
Here are some options that I am mulling over.<#>NQ
Poll: If TODO comments were more "visible", would you resolve them faster?<#>Q
One of the known problems with //TODO comments is that they tend to get "lost in the code" and are often never returned to.<#>NQ
One usually finds them when searching the source code, or when actually going through the IDE task list (e.g., in Eclipse).<#>NQ
Of course, bug reports are easier to find, but research shows that developers aren't really winning to open a bug report for every little thing.<#>NQ
So my question is this: suppose that you're using the IDE and:<#>NQ
1) Every //TODO comment is highlighted better (e.g., surrounding box or background) instead of the current low-key color and small icon in the side.<#>NQ
2) Every call to a method that has a //TODO comment is highlighted in some way, to let you know that the code you are looking at depends on something unfinished.<#>NQ
Would that be useful and make you more likely to fix problems (to get rid of the marking or to make sure your code doesn't depend on anything broken), or would that annoy the hell out of you and make you turn the darn thing off?<#>Q
[EDIT: My question is directed at those who do use //TODO comments.<#>NQ
I am well aware of their evils, but research does show that many people do use them because bug reports are too expensive/visible] and because they plan for these comments to be transient.<#>NQ
What are your efficiency gains by removing XML in java projects?<#>Q
I have just moved from phase 1 to phase 2 of a project.<#>NQ
In this transition we got rid of all of the XML configuration for spring and struts2, switching to a fully annotated regime.<#>NQ
All of the participants are amazed at the actual effect this has on development speed.<#>NQ
There are a number of reasons for this:<#>NQ
Some of these gains could probably have been realized by re-structuring the xml as well, but that would not have been a trivial task.<#>NQ
I honestly believe this has given somewhere around 10% boost in productivity for our 20,000 man hour project.<#>NQ
I almost find it hard to believe. <#>NQ
Anyone else sharing this same experience ?<#>Q
What's your gain, and how do you explain it ?<#>Q
What do you find to be difficult and frustrating about managing software development?<#>Q
If you ever managed a software development effort or parts of it in any capacity when what bits did you find difficult or frustrating?<#>Q
What did happen at the end?<#>Q
UPDATE: It would be nice to hear some actual stories as opposed to "geeks are difficult people".<#>NQ
Does users really prefer quicker apps or does features trump all?<#>Q
How much of an impact does a faster application count considering the competition, or does features trump everything?<#>Q
Where is the balance point, and for what type of apps?<#>Q
Where do you look for team members?<#>Q
What sites do you use to find memembers for a team for game development? <#>Q
Looking for Artists and Sound people can be tough on sites like GameDev.Net because that's what everybody is looking for there.<#>NQ
What are some recommendations for finding people that are not coders to help you on game projects?<#>Q
Open source: Why or why not?<#>Q
We are currently considering licensing options and releasing our app as open source is one of the options on the table, but we have some concerns about forks and a few other issues as well.<#>NQ
If you've been involved with the licensing of a software your company has produced, what were the considerations that ultimately made you accept or reject an open source license?<#>Q
Also, as a programmer, are you more or less likely to use open source tools in your work and why?<#>Q
Poll: Does your CTO actually Code?<#>Q
I've worked for a few organizations during my career, ranging from small to gigantic.<#>NQ
In my most recent company, I've encountered something that is new to me: our CTO codes.<#>NQ
Codes heavily, codes often.<#>NQ
[This is not a small company].<#>NQ
Are any other SO users in situations where the CTO actually performs coding duties?<#>Q
If so, is this a good thing, or a bad thing?<#>Q
Is this something more likely in a small, medium or large organization?<#>Q
And, any advice to other developers and leaders in an organization where this happens?<#>Q
Python bracket convention<#>NQ
What do you think is the convention that is mostly used when writing dictionary literals in the code?<#>Q
I'll write one possible convention as an answer.<#>NQ
Line width formatting standard<#>NQ
Do you follow a standard for wrapping long lines in source code?<#>Q
What line length do you find most comfortable to read?<#>Q
Sometimes I find people who program on wide-screen monitors and like to use its full width for displaying source code.<#>NQ
I prefer shorter lines, around 80-100 characters, but I have a hard time trying to convince colleagues with the ever-increasing popularity of wide-screen devices.<#>NQ

Bundling .NET in installer<#>NQ
Would you (or your customers) rather download a 1mb installer and perhaps be prompted to download and install .NET, or a 23mb installer and never need to even know what .NET is?<#>Q
What is a good PHP script I can use as a poll?<#>Q
What is a good free PHP script to use as a poll for a website?<#>Q
I'd need a simple script to show on the web page with the standard multiple option vote + bar chart graph.<#>NQ
Also an admin interface with add / edit / delete poll would be required.<#>NQ
developing on a computer by remote desktoping into it, experiences?<#>NQ
Does anyone (out of choice or forced) develop on a computer that they have to remote desktop into?<#>Q
How has your experiences been with it?<#>Q
I can see the advantages as you can basically code from anyplace in the world so long as you have a fast enough connection.<#>NQ
1000th commit party?<#>NQ
Some projects teams throw a small office party for major releases - so why not for 1000th commit?<#>Q
1000th commit is a good marker, usually project has progressed quite nicely by that time.<#>NQ
Do you celebrate or give any extra attention to such 'magic number' commits? <#>Q
Which java YAML library should I use?<#>Q
There are at least 4 YAML implementations listed at yaml.org.<#>NQ
Which one of these (or another) would you recommend, and why? <#>Q
There are two ways you could answer this question, either by voting for one of the 4, or by giving a good answer that compares them or strongly justifies one of them.<#>NQ
I'll add the 4 mentioned so people can vote, but I'd love a longer justified answer if you could write one.<#>NQ
Choosing a new language<#>NQ
I've been programming now for 30 years, BASIC, various assemblers, FORTH, Pascal, C and C++ in that order.<#>NQ
I haven't learnt a new language in over a decade because from a work perspective C++ does everything I need.<#>NQ
However, from a technology perspective, I'd like to bring my skills up to date, particularly in the areas of web development and use of scripting languages that let you do alot without too much programming.<#>NQ
The languages I'm considering are Python, Ruby, Java and Haskell.<#>NQ
In my position which would you go for and why.  <#>NQ
(Edit: Qualify your answers please. I will down vote unqualified one-liners)<#>NQ
How are standard libraries, tools and app server platforms typically selected in large organizations?<#>Q
I'm looking for a list of criteria for selecting standard development libraries, tools, and application servers (specifically JEE) that is common across large organizations.<#>NQ
If your experience doesn't span across multiple large orgs, answering with how this is conducted within your current org is still helpful.<#>NQ
Also - 'standard' doesn't mean mandatory or exclusive, only that alternatives must be technically justified.<#>NQ
Extra points:<#>NQ
Are there standard development libraries, tools, and app server software within your organization at all?<#>Q
If so how well are they adhered to?<#>Q
Are there "de facto standards"?<#>Q
Is there no standard or a decentralized way of doing business?<#>Q
Are there primary/secondary or "recommended" standards?<#>Q
Should developers be given laptops or desktops?<#>Q
I'm aware that a similar question has been asked before here but this is more of question of which is better of a departmental scale.<#>NQ
At my last job Code monkeys were given desktops and project managers were given Laptops.<#>NQ
The reasoning being that project managers went to more meetings so needed to take thier computers with them.<#>NQ
Because they wouldn't allow us to have the code on our personal machines in order to work from home, we had to remote desktop over a VPN into work in order to work from home.<#>NQ
At my new job I've been given a laptop and personally I love it, I plug into a monitor at work and use 2 screen, and I can work from home without having to deal with a crushingly slow vpn.<#>NQ
In general though accross a development team is it better to give developers laptops tor desktops?<#>Q
Desktops have raw power and cost in thier favour, plus it's easier to get the holy 3 monitor setup on a desktop, but if you work from home or anywhere else you can't work on the same machine.<#>NQ
Laptops can have an extra screen are obviously portable which allows you to work anywhere, but cost more and are likely to be less powerful.<#>NQ
What does everyone think?<#>Q
How was your "Text Editor Transition" according to your preferred languages (html, css c++, python, java , etc..)?<#>Q
I thought it would be interesting to know how people's tool preferences evolve.<#>NQ
Mine was like this (Web development):<#>NQ
Dreamweaver (or Expression Web) -> I realized that WYSIWYG sucks -> Textmate (or E Text-Editor) -> I got sick of paid software becasue they are generally heavier and updates are harder to get -> Eclipse (Aptana) -> I got tired of heavy IDEs -> Notepad++ -> I realized that the mouse is useless -> Vim (or Emacs)<#>NQ
How was yours?<#>Q
least 'worth it' unit test you've ever written?<#>Q
On the SO blog and podcast Joel and Jeff have been discussing the, often ignored, times when unit testing a particular feature simply isn't worth the effort.<#>NQ
Those times when unit testing a simple feature is so complicated, unpredictable, or impractical that the cost of the test doesn't reflect the value of the feature.<#>NQ
In Joel's case, the example called for a complicated image comparison to simply determine compression quality if they had decided to write the test.<#>NQ
What are some cases you've run into where this was the case?<#>Q
Common areas I can think of are GUIs, page layout, audio testing (testing to make sure an audible warning sounded, for example), etc.<#>NQ
I'm looking for horror stories and actual real-world examples, not guesses (like I just did).<#>NQ
Bonus points if you, or whoever had to write said 'impossible' test, went ahead and wrote it anyways.<#>NQ
Best video manipulation library for python?<#>Q
I'd like to include some simple video editing functionality for the python application I'm writing and googling comes up with:<#>NQ
Requirements: <#>NQ
If you've used any of the above video editing libraries listed above or others I have yet to come across in your python application, I'd like to know the pitfalls for each and how they stack up against each other.<#>NQ
If you also know of a python binding for avbin, I would like to know where to find it. <#>NQ
gst-python (Gstreamer with python bindings) doesn't seem to be very well documented.<#>NQ
It also appears to be tightly coupled with pyGTK, which is also a pretty big toolkit.      <#>NQ
Want to learn Plugin/Template Development.<#>NQ
Wordpress or Joomla?<#>Q
i seem to be getting the impression that Wordpress is more popular than joomla nowadays.<#>NQ
but i also get the impression joomla is more powerful. <#>NQ
so which do you think will give better prospects if i were to want to learn to develop for one. <#>Q
How much business knowledge do you need, to be an effective developer?<#>Q
Most contract roles I have gone for, target developers with excellent business knowledge, especially in investment banking.<#>NQ
Their reasoning is that they are a better, well rounded developer, that can come up with better design solutions, with added value - which I tend to agree with.  <#>NQ
Also I have been turned down for roles because I don't have enough business knowledge, which can be very frustrating indeed.<#>NQ
This can be a big problem when you're just starting out.<#>NQ
The problem is how much business knowledge should I choose to learn?<#>Q
50/50, 25/75 or keep to being a pure technician?  <#>Q
Manual vs. Automatic Memory Management<#>NQ
Do you prefer malloc and free / new, delete, etc... or do you prefer your language to have garbage collection?<#>Q
Why and why not?<#>Q
Do you have any proof besides your own reasoning about why your method is better?<#>Q
Motivation - How do you change it from fear to fun?<#>Q
So if you are like me in your 9 to 5 job, your motivation goes pretty much in this order...<#>NQ
I'd say it is 80% fear, 15% pressure, and 5% fun.<#>NQ
Not a very good mix.<#>NQ
Like most, I want to flip 1 and 3 (can't control 2).<#>NQ
But with the years of habit accumulation, not only by me but my family, it is hard to "risk it all".<#>NQ
How would you flip fear for fun?<#>Q
Pretty pathetic.<#>NQ
What are the most useful software development metrics?<#>Q
I would like to track metrics that can be used to improve my team’s software development process, improve time estimates, and detect special case variations that need to be addressed during the project execution.<#>NQ
Please limit each answer to a single metric, describe how to use it, and vote up the good answers.<#>NQ
What are the most important things to know about Ruby?<#>Q
I am new to the language and I need to know what are the top things that are absolutely necessary to know in order to make a fully functional website or web app using the Ruby programming language?<#>Q
Mainly Ruby on Rails with Rake and other tools that mainly use Rake.<#>NQ
Update: I know many other languages like C++, Java, PHP, Perl, etc, etc ....<#>NQ
Update 2: This is great ... keep 'em coming!<#>NQ
How many tests cover each method in your TDD code base?<#>Q
As part of my research on projects written using TDD, I would like to build a histogram like: x% of methods were covered by y% of tests (e.g. 60% of methods covered by 10% of tests, 25% of methods covered by 20% of tests, and 15% of methods covered by 30% of tests).<#>NQ
Generally, when y goes up x is expected to go down.<#>NQ
I hypothesize that TDD encourages y to be relatively high, but I need some data to support this claim.<#>NQ
Can anyone provide such metrics for their TDD project?<#>Q
Iphone Poll - A 80MB download & install VS a 30MB download & install (But with 25second install time)?<#>NQ
So, I have a database that is 80MB uncompressed.<#>NQ
I've gz'd it to 30MB, but it now requires a 25 second "unpack" time when the application first launches.<#>NQ
I've written this code in C, making it as fast as possible (no NS* types, minimal code to complete the read from the gz to the write of the new .db).<#>NQ
Here's a bit of data on the sizes of a buffer I've used and the timing:<#>NQ
So my question is, would you rather have a 80MB download and install to the iphone and no wait on startup, or a 30MB download and install with a 25second installs process on the FIRST boot only?<#>Q
Also, if you are ok w/the 25s install, what indicators would you expect?<#>Q
A throbber, progress bar, splash screen w/explanation...?<#>NQ
Thanks, can't wait to get your input!<#>NQ
NOTE: I know I can pull data from the network, that's not the point.<#>NQ
This is a offline app that needs to work 100% so I have to have the data.<#>NQ
I like having it in SQL because its manageable.<#>NQ
I don't want 30,000+ txt files.<#>NQ
Recommendations for a Windows based make tool<#>NQ
Does anyone have any recommendations for a good, fast, make tool?<#>Q
Something else?<#>Q
Cross platform tools would also be acceptable.<#>NQ
Most pythonic way of counting matching elements in something iterable<#>NQ
I have an iterable of entries on which I would like to gather some simple statistics, say the count of all numbers divisible by two and the count of all numbers divisible by three.<#>NQ
My first alternative, While only iterating through the list once and avoiding the list expansion (and keeping the split loop refactoring in mind), looks rather bloated:<#>NQ
This looks rather nice, but has the drawback of expanding the expression to a list:<#>NQ
What I would really like is something like a function like this:<#>NQ
But this looks a lot like something that could be done without a function.<#>NQ
The final variant is this:<#>NQ
and while the smallest (and in my book probably the most elegant) it doesn't feel like it expresses the intent very well.<#>NQ
So, my question to you is:<#>NQ
Which alternative do you like best to gather these types of stats?<#>Q
Feel free to supply your own alternative if you have something better.<#>NQ
To clear up some confusion below:<#>NQ
Implementation examples for common architectural patterns/idioms?<#>NQ
I was wondering where it is possible to find implementation as illustrative examples for commonly used architectural patterns/idioms<#>Q
For example<#>NQ
What do you call the punctuation marks { and }?<#>Q
Curly brackets?<#>NQ
Something else?<#>Q
What is a good user interface element for voting in web?<#>Q
I have the following scenario:<#>NQ
The website presents the user with a list of choices.<#>NQ
The user can vote for them.<#>NQ
The user has 3 votes that he can spend.<#>NQ
He can place all 3 votes on one item, or he can distribute them among multiple items.<#>NQ
He can also change his vote placements later (the choices aren't fixed and a new, better choice might appear later on).<#>NQ
So I'm wondering what user interface element would best represent this.<#>Q
It should be simple, intuitive, preferably widely used.<#>NQ
I'm thinking about something like clickable series of icons (like in lolcats and other places), but I can't figure out an intuitive way for a user to remove a vote he has placed in such a way.<#>NQ
Maybe I could display another icon for removing a vote entirely, but that seems somehow awkward to me.<#>NQ
Any ideas?<#>Q
What's your favourite assisted theorem prover?<#>Q
I'm hoping to pick one of the many assisted theorem provers (rather than automatic ones) but there are rather a lot to choose from!<#>NQ
Does anyone have any you prefer and may I ask why?<#>Q
C++0x - export gone, exception specs deprecated.<#>NQ
Will this affect your code?<#>Q
This latest Herb Sutter trip report on the C++0x standardisation process indicates that the committee has decided to completely drop the "export" concept for templates, and to deprecate exception specifications.<#>NQ
I think these are both good moves, but I'm interested if anyone out there has a code base where these changes will cause them sleepless nights?<#>Q
D Templates: Coolest Hack<#>NQ
What is the coolest somewhat practical metaprogramming hack you've done or seen done in the D programming language?<#>Q
Somewhat practical means excluding, for example, the compile-time raytracer.<#>NQ
How 'dangerous' is your job?<#>Q
A recent chat with some ex-colleagues (who had gone on to bigger and better things) went something like this:<#>NQ
Coll 1 (an admin): "If my app goes down, I'll have to rebuild the databases"<#>NQ
Coll 2 (IT manager in a cosmetic company): "If my app goes down we have to scrap the production run and restart"<#>NQ
Coll 3 (IT manager for high street banking group): "If my app goes down we will be on the evening news!<#>NQ
Made me kinda glad to be working on mickey-mouse apps!<#>NQ
How dangerous/visible is your job?<#>Q
Most inappropriate function or variable names you have encountered?<#>Q
I was reading through my daily doze of RSS when I  noticed a link to the python compiler documentation where class names like assList, assName and assTuple exist.<#>NQ
While starting names with 'ass' is perfectly acceptable to me, it just sparked this idea that there probably exist much better examples of this.<#>NQ
Have you personally used or otherwise encountered any inappropriate function or variable names?<#>Q
Personally I have used 'crap' and 'moo' for temporary purposes, forgot them and at a later point they came too integrated for me to bother with fixing them.<#>NQ
What design pattern do you use the most?<#>Q
I'm interested in understanding what design patterns people find themselves using often.<#>NQ
Hopefully this list will help other recognize common scenarios and the associated design pattern that can be used to solve them.<#>NQ
Please describe a common problem you find yourself solving and the design pattern(s) you use to solve it.<#>NQ
Links to blogs or documentation describing the pattern are also appreciated.<#>NQ
Edit:  Please expand on your answers a bit, I would like this to be a useful reference for someone who wants to learn more about design patterns and is curious on what situations a specific design pattern might be used.<#>NQ
Nobody has linked to any "more learning" resources.<#>NQ
Java: examples of very hard to track-down bugs<#>NQ
Related to this question, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/570353/hardest-types-of-bugs-to-track, does anyone have any examples of real-world code that introduces extremely hard-to-identify bugs, e.g a Heisenbug?<#>Q
If you wanted to deliberately introduce a difficult bug, what would you do?<#>Q
What do you ask at an interview for a QA position?<#>Q
There are a ton of questions on this site about interview questions for programmers, but what about QA engineers?<#>Q
How can I make sure I'm getting somebody who really knows how to put test plans together and execute them?<#>Q
How much in the way of technical skills should I demand?<#>Q
I've worked with a few testers before who knew basic SQL, and that was great, because they could interact with the UI and then go check to make sure everything looked correct afterwards in the db.<#>NQ
Of course, if they're too technical they just end up programming and you lose your tester.<#>NQ
Are there any standard tools that testers use that they should be familar with?<#>Q
Has anybody had luck combining the QA role with product management?<#>Q
It seems like a perfect fit to me.<#>NQ
We all know we're supposed to have dedicated testers, but I bet few of us do.<#>NQ
We should know how to hire one when we actually get the chance.<#>NQ
Emacs keybinding hall of fame/shame<#>NQ
What are the best and worst emacs key bindings in development software?<#>Q
Ever since I learned it, I find myself trying to use C-p and C-n to move up and down in everything that has a text box on it.<#>NQ
I'm perpetually annoyed by software that has an emacs mode that's pretty obviously either put together by someone who's never used emacs before or it's done in a crappy manner.<#>NQ
So let's recognize the winners and losers in this thread.<#>NQ
Dependency injection framework<#>NQ

What is the "best" Open Source lolcode interpreter?<#>Q
I'm interested in studying how an interpreter works, and LOLCODE makes me laugh, so: What's the best OpenSource LOLCODE interpeter?<#>Q
Bonus points for providing a decent REPL.<#>NQ
What's your favorite unofficial doc?<#>Q
As of late, I've been noticing that with google, the best docs for a given library/framework/whatever are often not the official documentation.<#>NQ
Maybe this is because it takes a user to understand which parts are hard to learn?<#>Q
Anyway, even with google, the best docs aren't always easy to find (see: the purpose of stackoverflow =D ).<#>NQ
What is your favorite unofficial documentation?<#>Q
Please post each answer separately so we can vote :)<#>NQ
I'll start...<#>NQ
What should be included in a programmer's code of ethics?<#>Q
Recently there was an ethical question asked, but I'd like some input on what might be included in a comprehensive code of ethics.<#>NQ
I'm thinking of something along the lines of the Hippocratic Oath that professional software developers would hold to.<#>NQ
We are in a relatively new profession, so there's likely to be debate about what should and should not be included in an ethical code.<#>NQ
There are published ethical codes, such as  ACM's and GNU's, but there are deep philosophical differences among programmers.<#>NQ
Perhaps we can't find a definitive answer for how programmers should behave, but we can get some consensus on what most of us feel is right and wrong.<#>NQ
Please limit yourself to one point per answer so we can vote up or down.<#>NQ
Ideally, the most important ethical considerations will rise to the top and less important clauses will stay at the bottom.<#>NQ
I'd say it's fair game to "borrow" points from other published lists and get inspiration from the ethics tag.<#>NQ
Please cite any sources.<#>NQ
Inspired by MagicKat's answer.<#>NQ
Using lucene.net trunk on a production application<#>NQ
Currently I'm prototyping search with Lucene.Net-2.0-004 on a web application.<#>NQ
It's working very well, but it's quite an old version of Lucene.net<#>NQ
Is it "safe" to use the trunk version ?<#>Q
Are you doing it ?<#>Q
Log every time an exception is handled<#>NQ
I have noticed a discrepancy in views on logging and wanted to provide a poll on this issue to the SO community.<#>NQ
a similar question but not as a poll.<#>NQ
Poll:  Should exception handlers ALWAYS write to the log any time an exception is caught and handled?<#>Q
Note: This is not a question about how to handle the exception, or on how to re-throw the exception.<#>NQ
What transport layers other than TCP are supported by existing CORBA implementations<#>NQ
Which CORBA implementations in use today allow a different transport layer from TCP and which transport layers are these?<#>Q
I'm specifically interested in UDP transport.<#>NQ
Inspired by an answer and comment here, where they claim CORBA supports UDP:<#>NQ

What are the most useful JSF tag libraries?<#>Q
Initially, I'd like one recommendation per answer, if you also use that library then just vote up the previous answer.<#>NQ
My goal is to get to know what's out there apart from the most obvious ones:<#>NQ
These three are basically the only ones I know!<#>NQ
Php/Mysql Simple survey<#>NQ
I want to make a little php poll.<#>NQ
The script should ask the users a question they can only answer by numbers from 0-999.<#>NQ
After pressing the submit button the data should be stored into mysql.<#>NQ
So I just want to know how much users choosed the same number (in percent).<#>NQ
It's a simple poll but I don't want any output to be shown.<#>NQ
Which Javascript Framework is the simplest and most powerful?<#>Q
